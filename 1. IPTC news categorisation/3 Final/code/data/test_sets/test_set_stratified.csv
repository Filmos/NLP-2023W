"New cycling route opens, connecting western Slovenia and Italy","The hilly, wine-growing region of Goriška Brda, north-west of Nova Gorica, is now connected with the border town through Italy with a 20-kilometre cycling route, which will be particularly important as Nova Gorica and Italy's Gorizia assume the title of the European Capital of Culture in 2025.","The first section of the new route, running from Nova Gorica to Vipolže and Dobrovo through Italy opened in Goriška Brda on Friday. The project was included in the plans for construction of regional cycling routes to boost sustainable mobility in the summer of 2021.

State secretary at the Ministry for Cohesion and Regional Development Andreja Katič said at the opening ceremony that the project was important not only for locals but also for tourism and for promoting a healthy lifestyle.

A total of 3.7 kilometres of the almost 20-kilometre route run through Goriška Brda. This investment was worth over EUR 2 million, with the EU and state chipping in more than EUR 1.3 million and the Brda municipality EUR 783,000.

The project envisaged a separate cycling path and measures to slow down traffic in the Brda municipality and in Italy. The goal was to connect Nova Gorica, the centre of the Goriška region, with Dobrovo, the centre of the Brda municipality.

The investment is seen as paving the way for more cross-border projects to be funded by the EU. ""The construction of this cycling link connects Goriška Brda with urban centres, while at the same time promoting green mobility and encouraging active leisure time,"" the municipality wrote.

The first section of the cycling path runs from Dobrovo to Vipolže on the border with Italy via a local road, the second crosses Italy through local and regional roads, and the third goes from Italy through a bridge across the Soča River and crosses Gorizia to Nova Gorica, where the cycling path is mostly separated from the main roads or runs through less busy roads.",sport

Delo hopes Golob thought his Balkan strategy through,"Commenting on Prime Minister Robert Golob's visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the newspaper Delo says in Tuesday's front-page commentary that the prime minister created an impression in his statements during the visit that Slovenia dictates the EU's enlargement policy in the Western Balkans.","Since last December, when Bosnia and Herzegovina received the status of a candidate for EU membership, Slovenia has been presenting itself as the biggest advocate of keeping Bosnia and Herzegovina whole as opposed to dividing it into pieces in line with a non-paper that allegedly came from the office of the former prime minister.

""Whoever listened to the messages of the prime minister in Bosnia and Herzegovina yesterday, could get the impression that Slovenia is the one who sets the Western Balkans enlargement tempo to the 27 EU countries.""

This is so because Golob promoted a phased enlargement, but he did not mention that this concept had been introduced by ""his political godfather - French President Emmanuel Macron"" years ago.

""We hope that the Golob team has thought the phased enlargement concept through, because rather than speeding up the enlargement with it Macron actually slowed it down,"" Delo says in the commentary That Settles It!",politics
Slovenia sends help to flood-stricken Italian region,"A civil protection and disaster relief unit set off from Ajdoviščina on Monday to help mitigate the damage caused by severe flooding in the Emilia-Romagna region, north-central Italy. Equipped with two high-capacity pumps, the 32-member team of experts will be in charge of flood control pumping.","""18 team members will act as operatives and the rest will provide the necessary logistical support. The experienced and well-equipped unit will travel with a 15-vehicle convoy,"" said unit head Borut Horvat before the departure. An additional six people will provide logistical support from Slovenia.

""The team that set off today is excellent. This was practically the first team that we offered to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and truly meets the highest of standards,"" said state secretary at the Defence Ministry Rudi Medved. He added that we can be proud that the team was ready to at a moment's notice.

The unit, comprised of civil protection members from Celje and Nova Gorica will most likely stay in Italy until Friday. Then they will be replaced with new unit members if the situation calls for this. The entire unit has 50 members, said acting head of the Slovenian Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Leon Behin.

Due to heavy rainfall that has caused over 20 rivers to overflow and over 300 landslides, Italy requested help through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The floods are wreaking havoc in several regions, with the most damage in the provinces of Bologna, Forli-Cesena and Ravenna.

The natural disaster already claimed 14 fatalities, while tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated. The supply of electricity and water, as well as telecommunication services are interrupted.

The EU has mobilised units from Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia through its mechanism, the European Commission said in a press release.

The EU's Copernicus space observation programme has also provided emergency satellite mapping of the affected areas at the request of the Italian authorities.

"Employers claiming wage compensation for over 14,000 workers post-floods","Employers have claimed wage compensation for 14,415 employees who are unable to work because of the early August floods, data from the national Employment Service show.","Employers filed 2,110 applications for wage compensation for 14,415 workers between 17 August and 7 September in three different categories.

Most of them are related to a partial compensation due to force majeure (9,197 workers) and furloughed workers (4,547), both under the first emergency act passed post-floods.

The second emergency law introduced wage compensation for workers reassigned to do post-flood clear-ups with the employer.

Employers have between 4 and 18 September to apply for aid in this category, and in the first four days alone, 67 employers filed applications for 671 employees.

The Labour Ministry told the STA that the data is not yet final as the numbers are increasing.

A worker is entitled to 80% of their full salary in case of force majeure, but the total sum must not be lower than the minimum wage.

This measure is in place between 3 August and 31 December, and the employers will get full compensation for the wages of their workers who cannot work.

Furloughed workers are also compensated 80%, but not below the minimum wage, and the measure is in place until the end of the year, with the option of extension.

For this category of workers, employers will receive only 80% of the wage they will pay to the workers, and the highest state compensation is capped with the average salary in May 2023.

Wage compensation for workers cleaning up business premises can meanwhile be claimed for the period between 3 August and 3 September, and applications can be filed until 18 September. The state will pay the employers the entire sum paid to their workers, but not more than was the average salary in the country last May.",labour
Slovenians and Croatians happy border checks are abolished (feature),"As Croatia joins the Schengen area, people on both sides of the Slovenian-Croatian border are looking forward to faster and simpler travel. This holds especially true for locals living along the border, many of who have to cross it daily to get to work.","At midnight today, traffic gates at border crossings have been lifted and people are free to cross the border wherever they wish. However, they still need to carry a valid identification document.

Many Slovenians own real estate on Croatia's coast, often spending summer weekends at the seaside and driving back inland for work during the week.

Barbara from Ljubljana told the STA it was very hard to travel between Slovenia and Croatia along the coast during the summer, as roads are literally gridlocked.

Petra from Ljubljana, whose family spends much of the summer on Krk island, is happy that Croatia joined the Schengen and hopes that border checks will not be reintroduced.

Danijela, who lives on the Croatian side of the border near the very busy Sečovlje crossing but works in Slovenia, hopes this will indeed mean fewer traffic jams. ""I'll be able to say more in about two weeks,"" she was cautious. ""During the summer it was horrible. Constant gridlocks and long traffic jams. It is really hard to get to work and back home.""

Locals living near the Dobova border crossings are looking forward to the new regime after two years of very long tailbacks caused by Croatia's checks of coronavirus entry conditions.

In Dolenjska, Slovenians living close to the border will be able to go shopping across the border, especially for building materials, as for many it is faster to drive to Zaprešič in Croatia than to Novo Mesto in Slovenia.

Meanwhile, Joško Joras, a Slovenian living near the Sečovlje border crossing, who has been fighting for his stretch of land to be part of Slovenia, is less optimistic. ""Nothing changes for me,"" he said.

""I'm still in a territory where my human rights are violated and I suffer damage. Literally, I would say that ethnic cleansing is being conducted here.""

He has had a plot confiscated by Croatia for which he was paying a lease to the Slovenian Farm Land and Forest Fund. He accuses Slovenia of giving up its powers even though Croatia does not recognise the border arbitration ruling. The ruling declared his location, just south of the Dragonja river, a part of Croatia.",politics
Roman Games in Ptuj take visitors back in time,"Ptuj, Slovenia's oldest town, will be turning back the clock for four days starting Thursday, as it transforms into Roman Poetovio for the 16th Roman Games. Some 800 performers from six countries will recreate life and customs from 2,000 years ago, when the town was a major trading and craft centre.","The town and the Poetovio Roman Camp in the Štuki borough will be buzzing with gladiators, legionaries, senators, vestal virgins and other ancient Roman characters.

""For 16 years the Poetovio LXIX Society has been organizing one of the largest representations of the Roman era in this part of Europe with the aim of bringing to life stories over two millennia old and shed light on the history of our beautiful city,"" said the society's president Andrej Klasinc.

The festival will kick off today with a dedication ceremony and an evening party at the Poetovio Roman Camp, where a children's camp with creative workshops and an evening spectacle in the Roman theatre will take place on Friday.

The main event will take place on Saturday in the form of a morning procession through the streets of Ptuj featuring all the participants of the festival. In the afternoon, the action will move back to the camp, where the programme will include a Roman-style dinner.

Sunday will be family day and visitors will have the chance to enjoy themselves the way the Romans did until 4pm, when the closing ceremony will take place with a dedication of the main pillar for next year's Roman Games.

A key Roman military base turned trading and crafts centre, Poetovio was first mentioned in written records more than 1,950 years ago and had more than 40,000 inhabitants.

The organizers announced their plans of making the festival even more splendid via a network of sister cities to create an innovative Europe-scale story. They want to upgrade the Camp Poetovio project by including replicas of monuments and ceramic kilns, and recreating old crafts, agriculture and way of life in the ancient Roman city.

Ptuj Mayor Nuška Gajšek also feels that the Roman Games are ""a nice way of presenting the city's history, a part of what went on in Ptuj in the past, and from which we can learn a lot, especially courage and victorious principles,"" she said.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Extensive renaturation of Mura's wetland habitats completed,"A three-year project involving the renaturation of wetland habitats along the entire course of the Mura River in Slovenia has been completed. Over 106 hectares of various wetland habitats have been restored in the most extensive such project on the Mura to date, costing EUR 4.6 million.","The main objective was to restore aquatic, forest and grassland habitats along the river, which are protected as part of the EU's Natura 2000 network, the head of the Natura Mura project Aleksander Koren from the Maribor unit of the Nature Conservation Institute, explained.

""We have restored ten hectares of wet meadows, 32 hectares of riparian forest, two oxbow lakes, dug 20 ponds, renaturalised three kilometres of the Mura, connected more than nine kilometres of Mura's side channels to the main watercourse, and acquired almost 30 hectares of land,"" he said.

Koren pointed out that measures had been designed and implemented in a way that helped address the broader ecological problems of the Mura. He mentioned dredging, problems with the degradation of riparian forests, and the need to secure adequate quantities of good drinking water.

""All of this depends on the health of the Mura ecosystem, and the measures taken on the ground will add a little bit to flood safety as well,"" Koren concluded.

Almost 125,000 trees were planted and ample opportunities to learn provided via three information centres, four nature trails and five obstacle courses.

The project involved the Institute for Nature Conservation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning, the Water Directorate, the Slovenia Forest Service, the SiDG state forest company, the municipality of Velika Polana and the Murska Sobota Development Centre.",environmental issue
Severe floods hit parts of the country (adds),"Heavy rain has caused severe flooding in western, northern and parts of central Slovenia, while the Environment Agency (ARSO) has raised the weather alert to its highest as more rain and floods are expected.","ARSO data shows parts of northern, north-western and central Slovenia received more than 100 millimetres of rain within 24 hours, which is a month's worth of rain on average.

As the rain is expected to continue well into Saturday, a red alert was issued for those parts of the country as rivers have already burst their banks in some parts.

A state of emergency due to flooding has been declared in Komenda, north of Ljubljana, and people have been asked not to leave their homes in Kamnik, where all the kindergartens have been closed as all roads are blocked.

People have had to be evacuated from several parts of the country, including the Ličnica Valley in the Medvode municipality north-west of Ljubljana.

Downpours have also caused floods and landslides in the north-western Gorenjska region. ""The whole Gorenjska in under water,"" the regional Civil Protection commander Klemen Šmid summed up the situation for the STA.

The situation is worst in the Škofja Loka area, the valleys of Selca and Poljane, both of which have been cut off as flood water is blocking the roads.

Residential, commercial and other buildings have been flooded in the wider Škofja Loka area and landslides are threatening houses and roads. A fire engine has been damaged by a landslide in Trebija and a sports hall has been flooded in Gorenja Vas.

In Žiri, more than 100 buildings have been flooded, including several companies. Most of the roads are unpassable.

Flood water and landslides have also blocked several roads in the western town of Idrija, where people have been urged not to leave their homes except when absolutely necessary.

The Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration has recorded more than 1,000-weather related incidents within 12 hours across the country with roughly 170 firefighting units deployed in response.

Throughout the night firefighters were busy pumping water from flooded buildings, rescuing flooded vehicles, removing debris from under bridges and securing landslides.

People have been evacuated from at least three campsites.

There have been reports of flooded homes and landslides and flood water blocking roads from other parts of the country, including the areas of Tolmin and Cerkno and the Koroška region in the north.

Many roads, houses and business premises have been flooded in Koroška and the Savinja Valley and the Šalek Valley with several people caught at their flooded homes calling for help.

The NLB bank announced that many of its bank offices at the flood-hit areas would be unable to open today, in particular those in Koroška and the Kamnik areas.

The floods have caused disruption to rail and bus services with several railway sections blocked in the north and north-west, as A2 motorway between Ljubljana and Kranj has been opened for drivers without vignettes to serve as a bypass for flooded local and state roads.

The flood wave is moving south-east so problems are also expected there.

Meanwhile, warning sirens have went off in the wider areas of Maribor and Ptuj in the north-west due to the high discharge of the Drava River, which at the moment is almost 1,800 cubic metres per second in the Melje dam area.

Drago Murko of the Ptuj division of the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration said the Drava discharge at the Zlatoličje hydro power stations exceeded 2,000 m3, which was still within normal.

This was after Austria announced yesterday that the level of the Edling reservoir would be lowered.

From Thursday 4pm to 4am this morning, the heaviest rainfall was recorded at weather stations Pasja Ravan north-west of Ljubljana at 182.7 mm, and Vogel and Rudno Polje in the Alps at over 170 mm. More than 150 mm of rain was recorded at Ljubljana airport.",weather
Man involved in severed hand fraud fund guilty of murder,"Sebastien Abramov, the man who convinced his girlfriend to cut off her hand for insurance money in 2019, was found guilty on Friday of murdering his previous partner in 2015. He was handed a combined sentence of 30 years in prison.","The Celje District Court found Abramov guilty of murdering his 24-year-old partner Sara Veber with a semi-automatic rifle. Judge Marjana Topolovec Dolinšek said he had made a plan to portray the murder as an accident, which included him falsely presenting the murder weapon as faulty prior to the execution.

The lawyer hired by Veber's parents, Matjaž Šaloven, presented to the court a number of text messages showing Veber had been extremely miserable in the relationship with Abramov. He claimed the main motive for the murder was preventing the girl from talking about the illegal activities that Šaloven said the defendant had been involved in.

While Abramov received 27 years in prison for the murder and 30 combined due to the severed hand case, defence lawyer Dušan Tanko announced an appeal, arguing that the weapon indeed had issues and that it was unclear weather the victim was grabbing the weapon in line with her alleged habit.

The verdict comes on top of 33-year-old Abramov pleading guilty in 2021 together with his parents and his girlfriend Julija Adlešič of attempted insurance fraud that involved 21-old Adlešič cutting off her left hand just above the wrist with a circular saw in 2019.

There was EUR 1.2 million in insurance money in play in the case, but the police brought the arm to the hospital and it was sewn back on.","crime, law and justice"
Golob finds top Bosnia-Herzegovina officials supporting EU path,"After meeting Bosnia and Herzegovina's Chair of the Council of Ministers Borjana Krišto in Sarajevo on Thursday, Prime Minister Robert Golob met representatives of both chambers of parliament and members of the presidency. According to Golob, they all agreed on the EU path for Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Golob met members of the presidency Željka Cvijanović, Željko Komšić and Denis Bećirović, and representatives of the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples Nikola Špirić, Denis Zvizdić, Kemal Ademović and Dragan Čović.

""Our message was the same for all branches of government, and that is to recognise the historic moment to take the next steps,"" Golob told STA. He noted that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, each branch of government has its own role.

""The key role of the Bosnian parliament is how to get to an operational government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as quickly as possible. We talked about why this is necessary, but also why it is necessary for them to start taking certain measures as soon as possible, even if they may not find them so important,"" he added.

At the end of January, the House of Representatives confirmed the appointment of the new Council of Ministers, thus setting up the executive at the national level. A government was also formed in the Serbian entity, Republika Srpska, but not yet in the Bosniak-Croat entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The EU path for Bosnia and Herzegovina was also discussed at Golob's meeting with members of the presidency. The PM said the difference among the three nations, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, are at their most prominent there and so are the different views of the two Bosnian entities.

""At [the meeting the with] the presidency it was very clear which nation supports which political orientation, including in foreign policy. The good news is that at least as far as the EU path is concerned, which was the key topic today, everyone agreed in principle. We did not even look for a consensus on other topics, as this would have been an illusion,"" Golob told the STA.

The prime minister and the chair of the council of ministers were joined over a working lunch by Bosnian Foreign Minister Elmedin Konaković and Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Minister Staša Košarac.

The talks of what is Golob's first official bilateral visit abroad since he took office in June last year focussed on the importance of the EU future for the country and the people, strengthening of bilateral relations and looking for new business opportunities.

Golob promised Slovenia's help to the country on its way to EU membership. He said Slovenia would allocate an additional million euro from the state budget for technical support to Bosnia, while Krišto said that the Council of Ministers had already done some steps towards reforms.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is Slovenia's second most important economic partner in the region and the largest single recipient of Slovenian development aid, and the two countries are keen to further strengthen economic cooperation. According to Golob, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has a great potential for renewable energy sources, in which Slovenia and its investors are also willing to invest.",politics
Pirc Musar attending European Forum Alpbach,"President Nataša Pirc Musar will attend the European Forum Alpbach on Wednesday at the invitation of Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen. She will speak on a panel about the contribution that Slovenia and Austria can make in the areas of climate change, democracy, security and the economy, Pirc Musar's office said.","In the afternoon, Pirc Musar and the Austrian president will take part in the Austria in Europe panel to discuss the vision of a bolder Europe that must, among other things, speed up green transition, defend democratic values and take security into its own hands.

On the margins of the forum, Pirc Musar will also hold a bilateral meeting with Van der Bellen.

According to the website of the Austrian president, the pair will also meet with Governor of Tyrol Anton Matte, and the president of the European Forum Alpbach Andreas Treichl.

The European Forum Alpbach has been held since 1945 in the village of Alpbach in Austria and addresses topical social and political issues. Over the last decades, it has developed into a meeting place for influential experts, thinkers and decision-makers.

This year's forum, entitled Bold Europe, started on 19 August and will run until Saturday.

Comic book tells story of Nazi massacre,"A comic book set at the end of World War II in the mountains of the Austrian province of Carinthia, was at the centre of an event hosted by the Research Centre (ZRC) of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU) Tuesday evening. The book attempts to raise awareness about one of the last Nazi crimes against the Slovenian minority in Austria.","The book tells the story of a Nazi murder of eleven civilians, including seven children, on the Peršman farm in the mountains over the town of Eisenkappel/Železna Kapla. Three children survived the massacre, among them Ana Marija Sadovnik, who was 13 years old at the time and is at the centre of the story.

Writer Evelyn Steinthaler, whose grandmother was Slovenian, told the STA last night she had felt that by telling Sadovnik's story she could tell the story of a part of the nation's history. She told the STA that the massacre at the Peršman farm was virtually unknown in the Austrian public.

She decided to put the story in a comic book because this genre attracts more readers than non-fiction books. It was only after she had decided to write the comic book, that she learnt that in contrast to Austria, many World War II stories had been told in comics in France and Italy.

Entitled ""Peršmanhof 25 April 1945"", the comic book came out in Austria in 2018, while the Slovenian translation ""Peršmanova domačija. 25. april 1945"" was published last year. The book was illustrated by Verena Loisel, a Vienna-based illustrator and comic-book author.

The story starts only days after the allies free occupied territory, with an armed fight between a Nazi police unit and Partisans staying at the Peršman farm, killing eleven civilians, members of the families Sadovnik and Kogoj, who were living at the farm.

Those responsible for the crime were never punished, even though a trial was held a few years after the war ended.

The comic book focuses not only on the day of the murders but also on surviving in what was a nearly completely destroyed farm after the incident. The farm became a home in the late 1940s once again, before being turned into a museum in the 1980s.

Daniel Wutti, a teacher at the University of Klagenfurt and a representative of the Peršman Association, told the STA that the Peršman Museum was the only museum in Carinthia dedicated to anti-Nazi resistance. It also raises awareness about the Slovenian minority in Austria. Wutti said that these two topics are not very well known in Carinthia.

He believes the Peršman farm murder was one of the biggest Nazi massacres involving civilian population in Carinthia. This and many other crimes are not known to the majority German-speaking population, but are an integral part of the minority's remembrance.",human interest

On the day when the prosecutors presented the reconstruction of the escape, Aleksandr Uss, the suspect's father and the governor of the Russian region of Krasnoyarsk, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""friends abroad"" for helping his son escape and return to Russia.

Uss was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport last October upon the US's request and escaped a day before his planned extradition. He and another four Russians are charged with shipping military technology bought from US manufacturers to Russian buyers, some of which ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine.","crime, law and justice"
Canoeist Benjamin Savšek wins world champion title in London,Slovenian canoeist Benjamin Savšek won the gold medal in the men's C1 event as the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships at the Lee Valley White Water Centre near London on Friday. This is the second world title for the reigning Olympic champion.,"The 36-year-old Olympic gold medallist from Tokyo was the best already in the semi-finals, and in the final he dominated his rivals again, beating the second-placed French Nicolas Gestin by 1.18 seconds. The third place went to Italian Paolo Ceccon.

The second Slovenian finalist, Luka Božič, took 10th place after a major mistake, which cost him 52 penalty seconds. Had he not been penalised, he would be second only to Savšek.

The veteran Savšek, one of the most accomplished Slovenian canoeist, meanwhile added to his medal tally, which includes gold in the C1 team event at the world championships in 2022, and eleven medals at the European championships (seven golds).",sport
Večer comments on power of oblivion in politics and society,"Večer says in Wednesday's commentary that the police, prosecution and all other relevant institutions should be working hard for months to get to the bottom of the scandal involving the SDS party abusing the money laundering prevention office. But they are doing nothing, the newspaper says, noting the power of oblivion in politics and society.","""We can conclude that the system of the rule of law, which was created after independence, has failed. This time it is not only about corruption, destruction of the media and abuse of the police,"" Večer says in Power of Oblivion in Politics and Society.

The thing is that the police, prosecution and all other relevant institutions should be working hard for months, the newspaper says, adding that in functioning democracies there would already be intensive and priority investigations, arrests and resignations.

""If nothing else, the public should demand all this. So can we add apathy to oblivion,"" Večer wonders, as it notes that it refers to the ""scandal of all scandals"", next to which all the other scandals during the Covid-19 epidemic seem irrelevant.

It notes that members of the now opposition Democratic Party (SDS) abused the Office for Money Laundering Prevention to illegally obtain data they can use to extort and discipline prominent individuals who did not bow to them.

This is abuse that can be compared to the times of the Yugoslav secret police UDBA. ""It was them yesterday, and tomorrow it will be you,"" Večer says, adding that this is something unheard of in Slovenia as a young democracy.

Slovenia is now on the verge of new oblivion. ""In a year we will find out that investigations produced no results, that the rule of law is severely handicapped and that the people who use the most vile methods ... are still among us.""

The paper concludes by saying that, eventually, people will have to accept the sad truth that only elections perform the function of the rule of law.","crime, law and justice"
MPs vote on new cabinet line-up,Nine ministers will be appointed at a regular session of the National Assembly on Wednesday in what will be the final step in a government reshuffle delayed by a referendum on changes to the government act that expands the number of portfolios to twenty.,"The government will get three new ministries: one in charge of solidarity for an equitable future, one for higher education, science and innovation, and one dealing with the environment, climate and energy.

Doctors' trade union insisting on strike announcement,"The government presented on Wednesday its proposal for setting up the announced separate pay tier for the healthcare within the public sector after Fides, the trade union of doctors and dentists, announced that industrial action, averted after two deals reached with the government last October and in January, would proceed on 2 April.","Fides said the proposal was modest but a step in the right direction. It insists on the strike unless the separate pay tier is formed by 1 April as the government promised.

Irena Ilešič Čujovič, president of the Trade Union of Health Care and Social Care, said the proposal had been sent to trade unions just before today's negotiations. She said this was the first government's proposal after two months.

The proposal is incomplete, as it does not address all aspects of the proposal that trade unions sent to the government and was not specific enough, she said.

The head of the Trade Union of Healthcare Workers Slavica Mencinger said the proposal was modest but nevertheless a shift towards substance.

""We have agreed that by the next round of negotiations next week, the government will finalise its proposal and make some concrete proposals, which will create a basis for more concrete negotiations,"" Ilešič Čujovič said.

Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan said that he and Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik now had a full mandate to create the separate pay tier.

The government informed the trade unions last Wednesday that the agreed formation of the separate pay would be postponed from 1 April as initially agreed to 1 June. The proposal would be filed into legislative procedure by 30 June.

Fides said this was a ""conscious violation of the strike agreement"" reached last October and announced the strike on 2 April. The trade union sent its proposal to the government on Tuesday evening and urged all other trade unions representing employees in healthcare and social care to add their proposals. Thus, all issues could be resolved by 1 April, Fides believes.

According to the STA's unofficial information Fides proposes that doctors and dentists who head medical teams be allowed to pick their team members freely.

The proposal lists doctors' ranks and introduces a bonus for deficit occupation, a bonus for tertiary service, as well as the transfer of promotions for specialists when they become specialists.

Unless the separate pay tier is formed by 1 April midnight, the announced strike will be held on 2 April as initially announced, meaning until an agreement is reached on meeting the strike demands. Fides is ready to negotiate until 1 April.

Asked whether he is ready to negotiate further to avert the strike, Bešič Loredan would not reply. He said the negotiations were under way and that the key date for the pay tier was 30 June.",labour
Man dies on road after having to drive himself to health centre,"The case of a 74-year-old man who died on Wednesday while driving himself to emergency treatment at the Velenje Health Centre will be subject to an internal and if need be external inquiry, Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan announced on Friday after unofficial reports claimed the health centre had failed to provide an ambulance for the man.","Bešič Loredan and the health centre's director Janko Šteharnik addressed the press after media reports saying a man had died on the road in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he was transporting himself to treatment for the second time in less than two hours.

Police said they had been notified of a car accident at 5:30am. The vehicle driven by the man had suddenly switched on all four indicators, crashed into a metal fence on the right side of the road before coming to a stop in a hedge on the far-left side. An ambulance was called, but the man, whose death police said was not caused by the accident, could no longer be helped.

Presenting the case, which is already being looked into by an investigative judge, Health Ministry officials explained that the man, who Šteharnik said had kidney stone issues, first called 112 at 4:02am to be referred to the Velenje Health Centre or ZD Velenje.

At 4:30am he was seen by the doctor on duty, who prescribed treatment and issued a referral for him to see a urologist in hospital, after which he was sent home.

At 5:08am he called 112 again and, given that he had already been treated at the health centre, it was agreed that he contact the doctor who had treated him. According to ZD Velenje, the doctor decided to take additional measures, and it was agreed that the man should come to the emergency room again.

Bešič Loredan said that both ambulances had been available at ZD Velenje during the time of the second call. This was confirmed by Šteharnik, who however highlighted the difference between emergency transport activated via 112 and non-emergency transport available from 7:00am onwards and in the domain of the doctor on duty, who does not order emergency transports.

Šteharnik said a commission at the health centre who examined the case today had already concluded that according to the information available, the patient had not had a life-threatening condition and had, accordingly, been referred by the emergency aid team to the doctor on duty.

""At no time did the patient inform the health professionals with documentation or verbally about anything other than the condition that was causing him pain. The team acted in full compliance with the regulations. And a coincidence, which is always possible in medicine, caused an unpleasant event, for which we are very sorry,"" Šteharnik said.

Minister Bešič Loredan, who already had to deal last September with an incident involving a fatal mix-up of two patients at Celje General Hospital, meanwhile started by apologising to the man's family. He said that like with the Celje case, the ministry stood by the position that the facts of the matter needed to be established first, including about the system of accepting such calls at ZD Velenje.

It need to be seen ""whether this is about a systemic anomaly, a local irregularity, for lack of a better word, or a professional error,"" he added. The minister already asserted the case confirmed the need for systemic changes in the field of emergency aid and dispatch, plans for which have been in the making for months and are expected to be ready next week.

A uniform central emergency dispatch system is meant to be expanded to the entire country by the start of next year. While it presently covers about half of the country, ZD Velenje will become part of it on 1 June, ministry officials explained.",disaster and accident
Hungarian speaker discuses economic cooperation and minority politics,"Hungary's parliamentary Speaker Laszlo Köver visited Slovenia on Monday to meet his Slovenian counterpart Urška Klakočar Zupančič. At a press conference after the meeting the pair praised the excellent relations between the two countries, their exemplary minority policies, and discussed options for strengthening the economic cooperation.","Klakočar Zupančič expressed the wish for stronger economic cooperation, especially more opportunities for Slovenian investors in the region populated by the Slovenian minority. Köver assured her there are no hurdles for potential Slovenian investments in Hungary.

The status of both the Slovenian minority in Hungary and the Hungarian minority in Slovenia are ""excellent or even exemplary"", the speakers found. Klakočar Zupančič noted that the minorities should be able to use their mother tongues in more areas of public life and that representatives of minorities in the parliaments could help shape the countries' policies.

The speakers exchanged views on the global political and security situation and topical EU challenges. Both countries wish for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, the pair said.

The pair agreed on the importance of support for the countries of the West Balkans in their process to join the EU, which according to Köver is important in the context of the central Europe that both Slovenia and Hungary are part of.

The speakers will meet with representatives of the minorities in May in the Porabje region in what will be a continuation of Monday's meeting and another opportunity to strengthen bilateral relations.

This afternoon, Klakočar Zupančič and Köver will attend the unveiling of a monument to Hungarian poet Sandor Petofi at La Ciotat Park in Kranj.

As part of his visit the Hungarian speaker will also meet with President Nataša Pirc Musar and Marko Lotrič, the president of the upper chamber of parliament.",politics
"Gen-I names new chairman, board members","Energy trader Gen-I shareholders, Gen energija and Gen-EL, named a new chairman and board members at Thursday's assembly as a one year term of the court-appointed interim management board ended. Maks Helbl was appointed chairman, while the new board members, joining Primož Stopnik, are Andreja Zupan and Sandi Kavalič.","All three new appointees have been with the company for over ten years and have been active in establishing the company and its market presence, Gen-I wrote in a press release.

Helbl worked as head of Gen-I's legal team, Zupan as sales director and Kavalič as head of risk management, noted the company, adding that they have complementary skills to lead the company and face challenges.

The new board of the company that is part of Slovenia's largest energy group will manage Gen-I for five years to focus on the phasing out of fossil fuels and the transition to renewables.

Gen-I will continue with activities in energy wholesale markets and manage the portfolio of customers on the local, regulated market. The new board will encourage corporate culture in the company.

After Gen-I exceeded EUR 3 billion in revenue in 2021, the company also achieved excellent business results in 2022, Gen-I wrote, but did not disclose details.

The court appointed the interim board after Robert Golob, now the country's prime minister, ended his third term as chairman and the shareholders failed to appoint a new team over different views on who should run the company. Igor Koprivnikar chaired the board with board members Primož Stropnik, Dejan Paravan and Andrej Šajn.","economy, business and finance"
Almost 900 drivers caught speeding in Friday's campaign,"Police officers caught almost 900 drivers speeding as part of Friday's speed limit enforcement marathon, which took place in 600 locations around Slovenia, with the vast majority, 583, being detected in urban areas.","The police announced on Monday, in addition to the speeding cases in urban areas, 123 violations were established on roads outside urban areas, and 191 on motorways and expressways.

Some 640 drivers were issued fines or relevant minor offence procedures were initiated against them, 146 of them paid the fine on the spot and 112 drivers were only warned.

The police said on the occasion that speeding was still the main cause of traffic accidents, accounting for about a fifth of all traffic accidents in recent years. In the event of fatal traffic accidents, this share is even higher (37%).

""The purpose of the speed limit enforcement marathon is to reduce the speeds on our roads. Drivers can improve traffic safety with calm and defensive driving,"" they said, expressing the hope that this would also be the case otherwise.

The Traffic Safety Agency said ahead of the campaign that almost 3,500 traffic accidents took place last year due to speeding, which is 17% more than in 2021. At 26, the number of deaths, meanwhile, was the lowest in the last five years.

On the other hand, the number of injuries sustained in traffic accidents increased, reaching the highest number in the last five years and being about a fifth higher than in 2021.

The agency and the police will also organise speed limit enforcement marathons on 5-11 June and 7-13 August.",disaster and accident
Central bank downgrades GDP growth to 4.7% for 2022,"Slovenia's GDP is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2022, the Slovenian central bank forecasts in its latest publication on macroeconomic trends, after it already downgraded the figure to 5% in December. The Statistics Office will release the country's GDP figures for last year on 28 February.","Short-term model assessment shows 0.1% quarterly GDP growth, which means 4.7% annual growth in 2022, Banka Slovenije wrote in January's Review of Macroeconomic Trends.

The central bank said that at the end of 2022 the eurozone experienced signs of weaker economic activity, but prospects for this year are improving.

Similarly, Slovenian exporters were faced with a demanding external environment, and the energy sector and manufacturing were faced with uncertainties in the international environment and with a major pressure on prices.

On the other hand, domestic consumption in Slovenia remained solid and business sentiment improved across the entire corporate sector, the central bank said.","economy, business and finance"
"SDS's anti-migrant rhetoric back again, Delo writes","Even though there is an apparent truce between the political blocks in Slovenia after the catastrophic floods, the opposition, especially the Democrats (SDS), continues to play its role, Delo writes in Friday's front-page commentary During a Truce, SDS Shoots at an Old Target.","Opposed to mandatory solidarity contributions for flood relief, the SDS is showing even less solidarity when it comes to migration policy, Delo writes, adding that the party sees migrants as sloths and parasites that have to be stopped at the border the hard way - with a fence, razor wire or batons.

The anti-migrant rhetoric has been a staple of the party for two decades and has garnered a considerable amount of votes.

That is why SDS has to mobilise every time the numbers of illegal border crossings rise, as it has this year. The migrant flow is concentrated around Brežice in the east, which is concerning to locals, but the current situation is nowhere near that of 2015, Delo writes.

The centre-left government does not know how to communicate to the population that migrations will not simply stop because a party does not like them.

Afraid of the SDS, the Interior Ministry is delaying the removal of the border fence in the area around Brežice, where the mayor is a member of the opposition party.

This government is not treating migrants much better than the previous one, despite the coalition agreement stating that safer migration paths and quick and effective asylum procedures, respecting human rights, will be provided to migrants.

The chaotic and inhuman conditions in the overcrowded Vič asylum centre are a complete denial of that, Delo writes.",politics
Reporter comments on political consequences of floods,"The weekly Reporter comments on Monday on the effects the recent floods are having on Slovenia's politics, saying the unity displayed by the coalition and opposition will not last. At this moment neither side can afford to seem unconstructive, but this will not last long.","Even though everything is about unity, solidarity and cooperation at the moment, politicians on both sides of the isle have their own political agendas, and photos of politicians helping in the clean up are a part of this.

The paper says that New Slovenia (NSi) head Matej Tonin was an exception in this. He helped in the relief efforts as a volunteer firefighter and had not posted any photos. ""Neither did many other people.""

The wide-ranging devastation means that the reconstruction will take a long time. Likely it will extend beyond the incumbent government's term. And it will cost several billion euros.

As a rule, no major project in Slovenia was completed without problems and many complications can also be expected now, the magazine says under the headline What Went Wrong?

This will be a tough test for Prime Minister Robert Golob. Health reform has proven a tough nut and now the government is faced with a mega reconstruction effort.",politics
Flood-stricken Savinja people to get advance payments by end of November,"Visiting the Savinja region in northeastern Slovenia on Saturday, government representatives vowed that flood-stricken people there would receive advance payments for renovation of their homes by the end of November. It is more and more likely that inhabitants of the village of Letuš will have to relocate due to serious flood risks.","Cabinet members started off their visit with meetings around the region and tours of most affected areas to get briefed on reconstruction efforts.

PM Robert Golob visited Braslovče, a small municipality not far from Celje, to inspect, together with Mayor Tomaž Žohar, a potential location for replacement construction in the village of Rakovlje, an area that the mayor finds appropriate for relocation.

Affected families from Letuš, a village that lies on both banks of the Savinja River, may have to relocate some four kilometres down the road to Rakovlje due to expert-confirmed flooding risks.

More information will likely be known after a meeting with the locals that is due next week, said Žohar at a press conference following talks with Golob and experts. The locals will hear experts' explanations about the threat level, Golob told the press conference.

""This is not a political decision, this is a decision that must be made by experts,"" underlined the prime minister, who believes that resilience to extreme weather events must be stepped-up.

Next week, experts will reveal threat levels in affected areas and where lives are at risk, the government will ensure replacement construction. A detailed list of homes and areas at risk will be made, he said, and the affected communities will have an opportunity to express their dilemmas.

If levees and other measures had been taken to prevent flooding in the Upper Savinja Valley, the situation downstream would have been much worse than it is today, said Rok Fazarinc, an engineer and hydrologist who is a member of the government's reconstruction service.

""Saving lives with potential levees and embankments makes the entire future situation much worse,"" said the mayor, adding that comprehensive measures had to be implemented.

Some of the Letuš people are against relocation, instead pushing for anti-flooding measures, but the others, aware of the risk, would like to relocate as soon as possible.

The Savinja region was one of the worst hit areas in the August flooding. So far, EUR 13.6 million in emergency solidarity aid has been paid out to the affected communities in the region, Dan Juvan, state secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, said in Mozirje, during the regional visit.

He noted effective and well-coordinated efforts by regional authorities in humanitarian aid distribution and replacement construction planning.

As much as 40% of all public funds allocated for emergency solidarity aid was paid out to flood-stricken families in the region, especially to those in the Upper Savinja Valley, where the situation was most dire, said Marko Verdev, head of the regional social services centre.

The government visit culminated in a meeting with mayors, business executives and NGO representatives in the region.

Addressing the forum in Žalec, Golob vowed that affected people would receive advance payments to renovate their homes by the end of November.

Savinja municipalities have so far received EUR 20 million in advance payments financing emergency recovery works. Some 6,000 residents reported damage after the floods, Golob said.

The existing legislation does not allow experts to implement mitigation measures, so the government is getting ready to change it, he added.

On Friday, Boštjan Šefic, head of the government's post-flood reconstruction service, visited the Luče municipality where the tiny village of Struge faces a major landslide risk. He believes that the locals should relocate due to a looming landslide, at least as a temporary solution.

At today's forum, he called for communication with mayors to be further upgraded.

The Savinja region will soon get a regional technical assistance office, which will be set up in Ljubno ob Savinji.

Before the visit, regional stakeholders warned that reconstruction works on watercourses should be done at a quicker pace, an opinion echoed today by Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek, who is currently also in charge of the portfolio of natural resources and spatial planning.

Next week, the authorities will decide what more is to be done by the end of the year, she said.

Žalec Mayor Janko Kos called for joint action on anti-flooding measures, and Nazarje Mayor Matjaž Pečovnik urged people to heed experts' instructions.

Noting that reconstruction will take a long time, business representatives warned against any measures that would put additional burden on affected companies.

The government ended the visit with a session held in Žalec where it started working on amendments to the relevant emergency law to make sure that affected families in the region will receive advance payments for renovation of their homes as soon as possible.

This is the second government visit to flood-hit regions after cabinet members visited the northern region Koroška in late September.",disaster and accident

Survey unemployment lowest in 30 years,"The survey unemployment rate in Slovenia dropped by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year to 4% in 2022, the lowest level in at least 30 years. The number of people who worked was the highest in the last decade, and the number of the unemployed the lowest, the Statistics Office said on Friday.","Some 41,000 people were jobless or 15% fewer than the year before. The shares of men and women among the unemployed were virtually equal.

The active population numbered 986,000 persons, which is 1.5% more than in 2021.

It comprised of 848,000 employed persons, 118,000 self-employed and 19,000 family workers.

Compared to the previous year, the number of employees increased by 2% and the number of family workers by 10%, while the number of self-employed remained the same.

Among the self-employed, almost three quarters (72%) were men.

Petrol group's net loss in 2022 corrected down to EUR 2.7m,"The Slovenian energy group Petrol last year generated a record EUR 9.5 billion in sales revenue, or 91% more than in the year before, while posting a net loss of EUR 2.7 million, and not EUR 12.1 million as announced in a preliminary estimate in January.","Petrol said in a press release on Friday that the year-on-year revenue growth was a result of the ""high volumes of fuels and petroleum products sold due to the low prices"" and the takeover of the Croatian fuel retailer Crodux.

Last year's sales are also significantly higher than the planned figure of EUR 5.9 billion.

The Petrol group sold EUR 4.1 million tonnes of fuel and petroleum products in 2022, an increase of 25% year-on-year. This accounted for 46.3% of total sales, with sales of energy and solutions representing a higher, 48.2% share.

The increase of sales revenue did not show in the adjusted gross profit, which dropped by 28% compared to 2021 to EUR 393.4 million.

Petrol said that this was due to the high cost of all energy commodities, the effect of regulation of motor fuels and other energy commodities and the damage suffered by the gas distributor Geoplin as a result of undelivered Russian natural gas.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at the group level were down by 60% to EUR 96.3 million, primarily due to regulation of motor fuel prices in all markets, whose effect was estimated at EUR 188.9 million.

Consequently, the structure of EBITDA changed considerably - the majority share was represented by merchandise and services with 71.4%, followed by energy and solutions with 18.9% and fuels and petroleum products with 2.6%.

The downgraded net loss of EUR 2.7 million, which compares to EUR 124.5 million net profit in 2021, does not take into account potential compensation that has been requested to offset the damage incurred in 2022 due to fuel price regulation.

Petrol is seeking some EUR 107 million in damages in Slovenia and EUR 56 million in Croatia, with proceedings for amicable dispute resolution being initiated with the Slovenian and the Croatian authorities, the company noted.

The amount of funds for investments in 2022 was adjusted to the changed circumstances, being reduced from the planned EUR 100 million to EUR EUR 59.8 million, of which 48% was invested in energy transition projects.

The report notes that the supervisory board said that the group ""appropriately adjusted its operations to the difficult market situation in 2022"" and ""mitigated the effects of negative trends in the energy market to the maximum possible extent.""

Petrol said that this had been confirmed by the rating awarded by S&P Global Ratings, which reaffirmed the company's BBB- long-term and A-3 short-term rating with a stable outlook in December 2022.

At the end of 2022, the group's retail network consisted of 594 filling stations, almost half of that outside of Slovenia. The number of charging stations for electric vehicles operated by Petrol increased 121 last year to 417.

For this year, the group plans EUR 10.2 billion in sales revenue, EUR 675 million in adjusted gross profit, EUR 250.4 million in EBITDA and EUR 117.1 million in net profit, with investments planned in the amount of EUR 75 million.","economy, business and finance"
"Debate notes benefits afforded by AI rise, along with need for caution","Participants of a conference on the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rapid progress of AI models, stressed in Ljubljana on Tuesday the need to harness the advantages of this technology while minimising risks. They noted the key role that knowledge will play in preventing people falling victim to AI.","Digital Transformation Minister Emilija Stojmenova Duh highlighted at the Artificial Intelligence: Revolution or Evolution? event the necessity of leveraging new technologies and tools that bring numerous benefits.

She stressed the importance of raising awareness about the risks involved, while criticising the prevailing discourse in Europe that expects the destruction of humanity by these new technologies.

The debate, held as part of the Chemistry Institute Digital Transformation Week, also heard professor Polona Domadenik from the School of Economics and Business in Ljubljana note that ""we, as a society, face a crucial challenge in educating people on how to use these new technologies"".

She said companies adopted new technologies in the pursuit of efficiency, while she also urged carefully assessing which areas require these technologies and accurately measuring the effects.

Professor Smiljana Gartner from the faculties of arts and education in Maribor also spoke of the need for a right balance that involves caution. A vast amount of knowledge will be needed to properly assess these technologies, she said, stressing the importance of providing appropriate education to both children and teachers.

Alenka Krapež, the principal of the Ljubljana Vič Grammar School in Ljubljana, agreed about the need for a proper level of IT knowledge to enable smart use, while arguing that fundamental forms of knowledge were even more important. ""Every chemist is first and foremost a chemist; they use tools when they need them.""

Without knowledge, people will be unable to distinguish what is true from what is not, as the danger of digitalisation lies in the flood of half-truths and even lies, Krapež added.

At the School of Economics and Business, they do not prohibit students from using ChatGPT, but new guidelines for writing papers have been established to ensure that ChatGPT cannot be the author, Domadenik explained. Instead, it can be considered a method, and the author of the paper must provide detailed information on how it was utilised.

The need to make use of the various new AI models was also noted by Marko Robnik Šikonja, a professor from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana, who argued that those failing to do so will no longer be competitive.

Nejc Robida from the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana spoke about ongoing efforts to acquire as much Slovenian language material as possible to improve the existing models when it comes to Slovenian.

""Corporate interests are not as strong for languages like Slovenian, so we need to take care of this infrastructure ourselves. We strive to take the initiative to provide researchers and companies with opportunities to develop these tools based on quality resources,"" he explained while highlighting funding challenges.",science and technology

She will also meet Prime Minister Tham Minh Chinh and Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien. A business event will also be held in Hanoi.

On Wednesday, Fajon will travel to Djakarta, where she will be received by hew Indonesian counterpart Retna Marsudi. She will also meet Kao Kim Hourn, the secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

The trip reflects Slovenia's wish for economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, especially south-east Asia. This is also in line with Slovenia's strategy on cooperation with the Indo-Pacific region, the ministry has said ahead of the visit.

Moreover, Slovenia is promoting its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2024-2025 ahead of the election coming up in two weeks.","economy, business and finance"
Flood-relief jobs eligible for fast-tracking announced,"The government has published a list of professions for which the issuing of work permits for foreigners has been simplified so that they can join the post-flood reconstruction effort. The professions include drivers of heavy lorries, bricklayers and carpenters, and various fitters and repairers of water and gas supply installations.","The relevant decree, which has been issued by Labour Minister Luka Mesec, entered into force last Saturday.

As announced by the Employment Service on Tuesday, the list of professions for which employers in Slovenia can utilise a fast-track procedure also covers welders and electricians and builders of various types.

In demand are also operators of various machinery, installers of metal structures, crane and lift operators, workers in forestry, cleaners, servers and housekeepers in offices, hotels and other institutions, cooks and kitchen assistants.

Also available are jobs in the occupations related to healthcare and social care at home.

For these shortage occupations, it will be possible for foreign workers - citizens of third countries who do not need a visa to enter and stay in Slovenia - to obtain a single work and residence permit more quickly.

The Employment Service will have to complete the procedure within 10 days and it will not have to check the unemployed register. Foreigners will thus be able to start working before they are issued the permit, which takes up to three months.

The Labour Ministry recently told the STA that the most applications were expected from the former Yugoslav republics, while labour from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova was also expected on a smaller scale.

The ministry said it was difficult to talk about the expected number, noting that the Employment Service had do far been receiving 4,000-5,000 applications for the issuance of permits under bilateral employment agreements on a monthly basis.

While employers have welcomed the measure, there are also concerns that some companies might abuse it. Minister Mesec has announced strict checks, noting that the Labour Inspectorate may issue a fine of up to EUR 30,000 for abuse.",labour
Slovenian pavilion at Venice architecture biennial to focus on energy efficiency,"Slovenia will showcase at the 18th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice this year a project exploring energy efficiency, a collaboration of two younger-generation architectural studios that was chosen in an open call published by the Ljubljana Museum of Architecture and Design (MAO).","The architects from Mertelj Vrabič Arhitekti and Vidic Grohar Arhitekti have designed the pavilion in response to the biennial's central theme - Laboratory of the Future.

They approached it with a critical examination of the relationship between the architectural design of a building and its energy efficiency, MAO said on Tuesday.

In modern times the design of a building and its energy efficiency are most often separate components, while the vernacular architecture of previous centuries knew no such division, as energy needs were inseparable from the architecture itself, meaning that buildings were energy efficient in their concept, the museum added.

Architects Maša Mertelj, Matic Vrabič, Eva Gusel, Anja Vidic and Jure Grohar will thus work with European artists and experts from different fields to explore this theme.

""We see this kind of exchange and networking as a form of contemporary global workshop and an opportunity to build an international network.

""This interdisciplinary way of practising architecture is one of the main themes of this year's biennale,"" they were quoted as saying in MAO's press release.

The project will explore examples of vernacular residential buildings from Europe where energy efficiency is an essential part of the architectural concept.

These energy principles will be published in a set of catalogues, while the pavilion will offer a reinterpretation of three examples from Slovenia to point to the possibilities of simple energy concepts for the future.

The project was chosen as part of an open call MAO published on 15 September 2021. MAO's curator Maja Vardjan has been named the Slovenian pavilion's commissioner.

Curated by Ghanaian-Scottish architect, academic and writer Lesley Lokko, this year's Biennale Architettura will run between 20 May and 26 November.","arts, culture and entertainment"
"Place of W Balkan countries in EU, but more will needed, Pirc Musar says","The place of all Western Balkan countries is in the EU, President Nataša Pirc Musar underlined as she hosted her Albanian counterpart Bajram Begaj on Thursday. However, the countries will have to show stronger political will to follow through, she said.","Talking to the press after her meeting with Begaj at the Brdo pri Kranju estate, Pirc Musar praised Albania's progress in its efforts to join the EU, also repeating her position that the EU enlargement process should be sped up.

She assessed Albania's progression toward the EU as positive, underlining that Slovenia remained a strong supporter of all Western Balkan countries joining the EU. Joining the EU is not an easy process, she noted, illustrating that countries need to adopt over 80,000 pages of the EU's legislation.

""When Slovenia joined the EU in 2004, nothing much changed for the country at that moment. The important steps are taken before a country joins and the day you become a member, you are fully prepared and don't even feel any change.""

Begaj, as well, said that his country had shown progress, admitting that much still remains to be done. He thanked Pirc Musar for ""the extremely important role Slovenia has played in ensuring stability and development of the Western Balkans"".

""To us, Slovenia is an important regional and European partner,"" said Begaj, expressing gratitude for unwavering help in the EU integration process of Albania and all other Western Balkan countries. He also believes that cooperation between Slovenia and Albania should be intensified.

The presidents also touched on the Brdo-Brijuni process, with this year's summit taking place in Northern Macedonia in September. They share the view that countries should focus on what unites them instead of their divisions.

They said this year the Brdo-Brijuni summit would focus on climate change, the youth, migrations, energy and natural disasters.

Begaj said that Brdo-Brijuni as well as the Bled Strategic Forum were important regional initiatives that help Western Balkan countries on their path toward the EU.

The presidents also talked about trade between their countries, noting that this year figures were higher than in 2022. ""We are coming close to EUR 95 million in goods trade. But this is not a figure to be satisfied with,"" said Pirc Musar.

She believes economic cooperation should be strengthened, above all in tourism, with Slovenia being able to share experience in green and sustainable tourism. Begaj asked his counterpart to advocate for direct flights between Ljubljana and Tirana.

He thanked Slovenia for aid provided after an earthquake shook his country in 2019, with Slovenia building a modular school that opened last year.

Pirc Musar added that Slovenia had invested about a million euro in development funds in a financial excellence education centre for Albanian state officials and public employees.

The presidents also talked about tensions in the north of Kosovo, both calling for dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. ""As long as the matter isn't settled there will be no peace in the region,"" Pirc Musar said.

She noted that Albania was currently a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, a position that Slovenia will take over for two years in 2024, adding that the tensions between Belgrade and Prishtina will continue to receive the necessary attention when Slovenia takes over.

Begaj was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Robert Golob today but held talks with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon instead. He also talked to National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič. Tomorrow, he and Pirc Musar will visit Bled and Radovljica.",politics
RTV Slovenija council foregoes on services of Janša lawyer,"The new council of public broadcaster RTV Slovenija announced on Monday it had decided to forgo on the services of the Matoz Law Firm, which is owned by Franci Matoz, the long-serving attorney of the Democratic Party (SDS) and its leader Janez Janša.","The decision was made in a correspondence session over the weekend after the body received a memo from acting TV Slovenija director Uroš Urbanija, informing its members that the Matoz Law Firm had been selected as the lowest bidder, at a price of EUR 50 per hour excluding VAT.

The N1 news portal reported that RTV Slovenija had also sent requests for bids to the Stušek law firm, owned by Janez Stušek, the head of the intelligence service SOVA under the third Janša government, and to the Janez Tekavec law firm, with which the broadcaster has a standing fixed-price contract.

The latter decided that representing the new council does not fall under the scope of the existing contract and offered a price of EUR 200 per hour excluding VAT, while Stušek set an hourly rate of EUR 150 excluding VAT, N1 reported.","crime, law and justice"
Minister advocates strong and resilient cohesion policy,"Participating in a two-day informal meeting of EU ministers in Murcia, Spain, Minister of Cohesion and Regional Development Aleksander Jevšek called for efforts for a strong, resilient and flexible cohesion policy that he believes should be the EU's main long-term investment policy, his ministry said.","At the start of a discussion on the future of European cohesion policy, Jevšek thanked EU member states for their help and expressions of solidarity in the aftermath of devastating floods that hit Slovenia in early August.

""Rapid responses of many countries and Slovenians show that the spirit of solidarity unites us so that we can achieve amazing things. The same goes for cohesion policy,"" he said.

He presented Slovenia's position that cohesion policy should remain the main investment policy for growth, employment, competitiveness and a balanced territorial development, the Ministry of Cohesion and Regional Development said in a press release.

""We need a strong, resilient and at the same time flexible cohesion policy since we live in a time where different social, economic, technological and geopolitical trends have a profound impact on our lives,"" the minister said, adding that no EU region should be put on the back burner because of the green and digital transitions or various crises.

He also noted the importance of a region-specific approach and called for continued efforts to provide conditions for a better quality of life for all EU citizens and more resilient economies.

Stressing the importance of synergies between cohesion policy, the Recovery and Resilience Facility and other EU programmes, and national funds, he said that relatively small member states with limited administrative capacities were having a hard time coordinating and managing different funds.

He also called for a more effective implementation of cohesion policy and well-coordinated cooperation among relevant partners on all levels.

The meeting of cohesion ministers, which started on Thursday, took place in Spain, which currently holds EU presidency.","economy, business and finance"
Changes to foreigners employment act passed to simplify hiring,"The National Assembly passed changes to the law on employment of foreigners to simplify hiring non-EU workers by 56 votes to 20 on Tuesday. The coalition welcomed the bill as addressing the severe shortage of workers in the public and corporate sectors, while the opposition believes it brings risks of abuse of social transfers.","Labour Ministry State Secretary Igor Feketija said the bill is aligned with the changes to the foreigners act and brings three key changes to speed up hiring.

Firstly, only an Employment Service permit rather than a decision by an administrative unit will be needed for a non-EU worker to change employer and job or work for several employers during the period in which they have a valid uniform permit - a permit allowing them to work and live in Slovenia.

Secondly, no Employment Service permit will be needed to hire foreign workers in health care and social care, two fields plagued by a severe shortage of workers.

The third change is that an asylum seeker will be able to access the labour market three months after being granted asylum seeker status, six months earlier than now.

Soniboj Knežak, an MP for the coalition Social Democrats (SD), welcomed the bill saying it addressed the needs of the labour market.

The average worker in Slovenia is 43.3 years old and the age is increasing, ""which consequently affects the number of domestic workforce in all professions"".

Also welcoming the bill, the Left's Miha Kordiš said the shortage of workers in health care and in care homes is not due to too few trained people. It is due to them being overworked and underpaid thus opting for jobs at discount retail chains such as Hofer and Lidl or in Austria.

The same goes for the corporate sector, were employers turn to third-world countries instead of improving working conditions and raising pay, he added.

Sandra Gazinkovski, an MP from the ruling Freedom Movement, said that in the given situation, ""our only option is immigrants"".

She believes calls by employers to shorten employment procedures should be headed, but she also pointed to the need for an effective migration and integration policy.

A different view was presented by the opposition.

New Slovenia (NSi) would expect the government to first address the issue of those Slovenians who receive social allowance while they could in fact work.

Alenka Helbl from the Democrats (SDS) stressed the bill was being fast-tracked through parliament while addressing an issue ""that has not emerged yesterday"".

The SDS was particularly bothered by the abolishment of the need for the administrative unit to issue a decision for a worker to change employer or job.

The party argued that once a foreigner receives the uniform permit, no-one checks whether they still meet the conditions to work and reside in Slovenia, which opens the door to abuse of social transfers. The SDS proposed several amendments, but they were all voted down.

The SDS is also bothered by the fact that the parliament's legal service provided 24 remarks about the bill's 37 articles, which were later heavily amended.",labour

Minister to discuss post-flood aid in Brussels,Minister of Cohesion and Regional Development Aleksander Jevšek will meet European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms Elisa Ferreira in Brussels on Thursday to discuss drawing of EU funds from the Solidarity Fund and redistribution of cohesion funds to help Slovenia in the aftermath of the devastating floods that hit the country a month ago.,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said as she visited the most affected areas soon after the disaster hit that EUR 400 million were available to Slovenia in the Solidarity Fund, of which the country could draw EUR 100 million this year.

Slovenia has until 27 October to request for the funding. Jevšek said in mid-August the application would be prepared thoroughly, so he expected no problems with its approval.

Cohesion funds are another possible source of EU funding for post-flood reconstruction. Some funds could also come from the 2014-2020 financial framework, and the government is also planning to redistribute cohesion funds under the 2021-2027 financial perspective, where a total of EUR 3.3 billion is available to Slovenia. The government is counting on around EUR 800 million from this source.

Slovenia also applied for additional loans from the European Resilience and Recovery Facility after the devastating floods.

A month ago, Slovenia was hit by the worst natural disaster in the history of the independent country. Damage is estimated at around EUR 4.7 billion, with up to EUR 7 billion to be spent for the reconstruction over the next five years.",disaster and accident
Source: Slovenia may get EU recovery funds in April,"Slovenia might have to wait until April before it receives the first round of funds from the EU's recovery and resilience facility, the STA has learnt from a source in Brussels a week after Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič said that the country can expect to receive the first funds by the end of March.","However, the source in Brussels said that by the end of March the European Commission might only just provide a preliminary assessment of Slovenia's claim.

A high-ranking European Commission official told the STA that it will take longer to assess the claim which Slovenia filed about four months ago. She said the country had failed to provide all data regarding the fulfilment of several milestones in the national recovery and resilience plan.

Now all the data required have been provided and are being assessed. If everything is in order, the preliminary assessment can be expected in March and then it may take over a month before the funds are paid out, the source said.

When commenting on the EU recovery funds as he arrived for an EU ministerial in Brussels a week ago, Boštjančič said that Slovenia faced ""quite a few challenges"" in drawing the funds from the facility which has been set up two years ago.

Slovenia sent its first claim, for some EUR 50 million in grants, to Brussels in October. Originally, it expected the funds to be paid out in January, as the Commission has two months to review the claims.

There are EUR 1.49 billion in grants available to Slovenia in the recovery and resilience facility and an additional EUR 3.2 billion in loans. Slovenia has so far decided to draw only EUR 705 million in grants.

Meanwhile, the government is working on changes to the national recovery and resilience plan. Changes are needed to integrate REPoverEU, a plan to lower the EU's energy dependency on Russia. The government is expected to discuss the changes in March.

Marking two years since the launch of the recovery and resilience facility today, the Commission said that EUR 97 billion in grants had been paid out and EUR 47 billion in loans. Slovenia has so far received only a prepayment worth just over EUR 230 million.","economy, business and finance"
Former health minister not returning to National Assembly,"Former Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan has informed the National Electoral Commission (DVK) that he will not be serving as MP. He is leaving politics and is not aware of objective reasons why Prime Minister Robert Golob called for his resignation, Bešič Loredan wrote to the commission.","""When on 7 July, after a five-minute discussion, the prime minister handed me a resignation letter that I did not write myself but I did sign, I needed some time to reflect thoroughly on everything. I also had to find employment and manage my social security,"" Bešič Loredan wrote. ""I believe you can understand that,"" he added.

He is giving up his right to serve as MP and he apologised for that to the people who voted for him. Aleksander Prosen Kralj will keep his seat in the National Assembly, which he took when Bešič Loredan became health minister.

The former minister said he had entered politics apolitically and with good intentions, adding that the prime minister had nominated him as health minister on the basis of a joint programme for a healthcare reform.

""Our team at the ministry never acted against the programme or without the prime minister's consent,"" Bešič Loredan wrote in a letter addressed to the commission, which he also forwarded to the STA.

He does not know the objective reasons why Golob offered him a resignation letter, but he respects Golob's responsibility to his voters. ""The prime minister is choosing members of his team legitimately,"" he wrote.

Bešič Loredan is leaving politics. ""I cannot and don't want to imagine that I could be productive as an MP of the Freedom Movement after all that has happened,"" the former minister wrote.

""I am a doctor, an orthopaedics specialist, and I wish to continue my calling in peace and for the good of the people and their health,"" he added.

Bešič Loredan was relieved of his duties as minister in parliament on 13 July after Golob offered him a letter of resignation to sign six days earlier over different views on health reform. Bešič Loredan then failed twice to collect certified mail by the DVK informing him of the right to serve as an MP.

EU Commission upgrades Slovenia's growth forecast for 2023 and 2024,"The European Commission has upgraded its forecast for Slovenia's GDP growth from 1% to 1.2% for this year and from 2% to 2.2% for 2024. Meanwhile, inflation outlook in the Commission's spring economic forecast looks a bit grimmer than in the winter interim forecast, but inflation is projected to recede somewhat in 2024.","The forecast for this year's GDP growth in Slovenia is slightly above the growth outlook for the euro area, which stands at 1.1%, and above the growth outlook for the EU economy - at 1%.

When it comes to the next year, Slovenia's outlook is higher than the forecasts for the euro area and the EU, which stand at 1.6% and 1.7%, respectively.

Inflation is expected to remain high in the country in 2023 and to recede somewhat in 2024. Inflation outlook has been revised upwards compared to the February forecast: from 6.1% to 7% for this year, and from 3.5% to 3.8% for 2024.

The Commission forecasts that Slovenia's employment will further improve and the unemployment rate, which has been hitting record lows, is projected to continue to decline - from 4% in 2022 to 3.8% by 2024. Meanwhile, employment is expected to increase, albeit at a slower pace than last year - by 0.7% in 2023 and by 0.5% in 2024.

The general government deficit is forecast to slim down to 2.9% in 2024 after reaching 3.7% this year. ""The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 69.9% in 2022 to 69.1% in 2023 and 66.6% in 2024 due to the changes in the headline deficit and the large increase in nominal GDP.""

The fiscal outlook has improved, but risks remain, the report warns, noting that projections for 2023 and 2024 are subject to several country-specific risks, including those stemming from the costs of the government's planned reforms.

Following two years of buoyant growth, private consumption in Slovenia will continue to grow in 2023 and 2024 but more moderately than in the past two years, as it is expected to increase by 1.75-2%. Consumption will be driven by continued growth in employment and rising wages.

After a growth of 4.3% in 2022, wages are expected to increase by 7.7% in 2023 and by 5.3% in 2024.

Public investment will remain strong, mainly as a result of measures financed by the Recovery and Resilience Facility and EU cohesion funds.

As a result, the Commission expects Slovenia to be one of the countries, along with Italy and Greece, which will increase the value of public investment the most by 2024.

Although financing conditions will deteriorate, companies are expected to invest in technologies to boost productivity, as labour availability is limited and wages are projected to rise rapidly, the latest outlook reads.

""While the contribution from net exports to growth is projected to remain neutral, improving terms of trade will help improve the trade balance and the current account which is set to record a surplus.""","economy, business and finance"
Dnevnik says substitute clinics might become a permanent thing,"Dnevnik says in Thursday's commentary that the doctors' surgeries for patients who have health insurance but no named GP, which have been offered as an exception and a stopgap solution, might as well become a permanent thing given the situation in healthcare.","As the first such offices are to be opened next week, they are expected to bring relief, the newspaper says, while noting that the shortcomings of such form of medical care are also known as a similar system has been in force in certain places.

When it comes to seriously ill people or older people with a range of concurrent health problems, substitute doctors' surgeries tend to fail quickly despite the good intentions of the staff, Dnevnik adds in Patient is the Best Excuse.

""Patients without a doctor who turned to the ombudsman for patients' rights, mentioned, for example, the confusion in the prescription of medications. The institute of general practitioner cannot be bypassed without consequences,"" the paper notes.

The doctors' surgeries for patients who have no named GP might nevertheless become a permanent thing as, given the uncertainties in the public health system, there are growing interests that swear by a greater role of private practitioners.

""The lines of people who depend on the substitute care are getting longer with each retirement of a GP. The patients, to whom all the decision-makers in the health care system are referring these days, are losing on a daily basis,"" concludes Dnevnik.",health
Rembrandt's prints on show at National Gallery,"Prints by the celebrated Dutch painter Rembrandt will be on show at the National Gallery in Ljubljana from 26 April to 30 July, along works by artists he inspired.","The exhibition features 43 of the Great Master's original prints and two of his etching plates and 14 prints by the contemporaries and later artists that were inspired by him, such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Pablo Picasso. All of the works come the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam.

To show how Rembrandt's printmaking influenced later generations of artists, including in Slovenia, the exhibition also includes ten works from the National Gallery's collection, such as those by Martin Johann Schmidt, Ivana Kobilca and Zoran Mušič.

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1606-1669) ranks as one of the greatest artists of all time. Apart from atmospheric paintings he is best known for today, he also produced more than 300 etchings. These are quite versatile, from small- to large-sized, from summary sketches to artfully detailed images.

In the catalogue accompanying the exhibition, the curator Jochem van Eijsden notes that Rembrandt was a great innovator, always exploring new ways and solutions to tell stories. During his life and in later decades, Rembrandt was mostly known for his pioneering prints.

On display are several of Rembrandt's most famous prints, including The Shell, which is his only still-life etching, five self-portraits, the influential print The Three Crosses and two phases of the motif Christ Presented to the People.

Rembrandt is known for the changes he made on the printing matrix during printing cycles of the same motif. These sheets allow the viewer to track the alterations in details, figures and the atmosphere.

His works are arranged according to aspects that most interested him, such as After Life, Light and Dark and Shaping a Character. The visitor follows the artist's approach to storytelling, and how he first made and then merged character studies, genre scenes and backgrounds to create enthralling tales.

A selection of the Great Master's prints from the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam was on display at Ljubljana's Cankarjev Dom in 2000, but the National Gallery believes almost a quarter of a century on time has come for new generations to get familiar with the great artist.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Dnevnik urges targeted measures to tackle inflation,"The government should urgently come up with targeted measures for specific groups which are most at risk of poverty, since general efforts to curb energy prices and monitor food prices are not enough, Dnevnik says on Friday.","""The government has severely restricted its wiggle room as a result of an unwise and extravagant fiscal policy that has led it to spend more than it should in the wrong places. If it wants to give (more) to some, it will have to take from others.""

The paper calls on the government to build on the measure of free school lunches by taking additional steps, such as kindergarten subsidies and access to essential school supplies.

The issue of those who struggle to make ends meet despite having a job is getting more and more serious amid soaring inflation, says the commentary Land of (Hidden) Poverty.

Prime Minister Robert Golob was right when he said last October that in times of crisis it is a must to help those who have less and not those who have more. ""It is high time we reminded him of his own words,"" says Dnevnik.",social issue

But Večer is puzzled by a recent poll which has shown that while 53% of the respondents said that Slovenia needs a flag carrier, only 17% supported its incorporation if the company would make losses.

It says the public should know that no business makes big profits at the start, especially if it is an airline where the aspect of profit is only one of several aspects.

Večer points to the negative effects of Slovenia not having an airline, such as hundreds of millions of euros being lost annually in business, including tourism and greenfield investments due to the poor air connectivity.

The paper hopes the private partner in the equation of the new carrier project could be a safety mechanism to prevent the state from acting irresponsibly with its new investment, which is probably the main reason why so many people don't support establishing a loss-making carrier.","economy, business and finance"
Statistics Office director Tomaž Smrekar resigns,"Tomaž Smrekar has resigned as director general of the country's Statistics Office (SURS), the STA learnt from SURS on Tuesday, while SURS declined to provide the reason. However, the resignation comes after SURS came under fire for significantly downgrading Slovenia's GDP growth figure for 2022 from 5.4% to 2.5% on 31 August.","The robust revision prompted the government two weeks ago to ask SURS for an explanation while it also indicated that Smrekar could be dismissed.

SURS denied any wrongdoing at the time, saying that the wide gap was the result of missing aggregate data when quarterly figures had been prepared.

Smrekar has led SURS since May 2020, when he was appointed acting head after the Janez Janša government dismissed his predecessor Bojan Nastav. In November of the same year, he was appointed for a full five-year term.",politics
DeSUS will not merge with Freedom Movement but is willing to cooperate,"The Pensioners' Party (DeSUS), which was a member of nine Slovenian governments until 2020 but then failed to make it to parliament in the last election, has rejected an offer to merge with the ruling Freedom Movement. However, it is willing to cooperate with the party on issues concerning pensioners, DeSUS head Ljubo Jasnič told the STA.","The Freedom Movement has offered DeSUS cooperation a while ago. ""We are convinced that the Freedom Movement's comprehensive connections with different organisations that unite the elderly, including the DeSUS party, would help include this important social group into projects that are important for the long-term improvement of their status,"" the party told the STA.

However, this week DeSUS's executive committee decided not to accept the merger offer. The Freedom Movement says though the party remains open for cooperation.

Jasnič said the executive committee decided against the merger because they wanted to work under their own name, but were ready to cooperate with the Freedom Movement, for example in the drafting of the pension legislation.",social issue
Posočje aiming to become first ecoregion in Slovenia,"A meeting of stakeholders in organic farming from the upper Posočje region in the west of Slovenia focused on Tuesday on plans to declare the first ecoregion in Slovenia. Conditions for organic farming in the region are good, many are already practising environment-friendly agriculture and more are bound to follow in the face of this initiative.","The Posočje region, stretching along the Soča River, includes the municipalities of Bovec, Kobarid, Tolmin and Kanal, whose 12.3% share of organic farms is substantially above the national average of 5.5%. The area covered by such farms in the region accounts for 26.5% of its farming land, compared to 11% on the national level, show data for 2021.

Jana Čuk of the Nova Gorica Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZ) unit pointed out at the meeting in Kobarid that a seminar organised in the region 25 years ago in fact sparked the launch of the first organic farms in Slovenia. The Čadrg ecovillage followed and now efforts are under way to declare the first ecoregion in the country.

The initiative, which will involve an application for the Agriculture Ministry's call for ecoregions next year, is spearhead by the Posočje Development Centre.

The ministry will allocate EUR 92 million for organic farming and EUR 1.5 million for organic beekeeping in the period 2023-2027, a significant increase on the previous period, when around EUR 60 million were made available.

Bogdan Črv, organic livestock consultant at KGZ Nova Gorica, stressed at the meeting that conditions for organic farming in Posočje are good an that many farms already meet the standards. However, due to the complexity of the procedures, many are not opting to join the official scheme, he noted.

According to Klemen Mlečnik from the Association of Organic Farmers of the Northern Primorska Region, joining forces is also the only way forward in this area. The era when organic farmers were oddballs is over.

Organic farming is also suitable for the development of tourism in Posočje, as it is not intensive and provides the visitor with quality local food and drink, cultivated landscapes and genuine relationships, exactly what western tourists are looking for, Mlečnik added.",lifestyle and leisure
Sculptor Drago Tršar dies,"Acclaimed modernist sculptor Drago Tršar has died shortly before his 96th birthday, the Ljubljana Academy of Fine Arts and Design (ALUO) announced on Tuesday. The professor emeritus, and ""his dedication to the art of sculpture and the teaching profession, and his diverse oeuvre will remain a lasting memory,"" the ALUO said.","Tršar studied at the academy after World War II, graduating in sculpture in 1951. His teachers included acclaimed artists such as Zdenko Kalin, Karel Putrih, Peter Loboda and Frančišek Smerdu.

He worked as a freelancer until 1959, a period during which he was commissioned with his first publicly displayed sculptures and monuments, and was also a part of an avant-garde group of artists called Grupa 53.

Tršar travelled to Paris, had a Prešeren Fund scholarship that allowed him to travel through Italy. He also travelled to Egypt, the Netherlands and Belgium. Later on, he also studied in the Soviet Union, Germany, as well as Italy.

His works were exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1958 and a year later he was featured at Documenta, a contemporary art exhibition taking place in Kassel ever five years. In 1960 he started teaching at the ALUO, making his way up the academic ladder to reach the title of full professor in 1974.

Tršar has received a number of awards, including the Prešeren Prize for lifetime achievements, the top art accolade in the country, in 1990 and the Jakopič Prize, the highest national award for lifetime achievements in fine and visual arts, in 1972.

He was also awarded at the Mediterranean Biennale in Alexandria in 1955 and became a regular member of the Slovenian Academy of Science and Arts in 1995.

Moderna Galerija, the national contemporary art museum, has said Tršar is often labelled as the most significant representative of his generation in sculpture. Six years ago the museum hosted a retrospective of his works to mark his 90th birthday.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Commentator sees reshuffle as attempt to defuse tensions,"The coming government reshuffle is an attempt by Prime Minister Robert Golob to defuse political and social tensions, political analyst Tanja Starič told the STA after Golob nominated a new health minister and it was revealed two ministers are likely on the way out.","The political developments are turbulent but not unexpected given that the government's problems started before the summer, but these problems were then pushed to the background by the flooding, she said.

Neither is it unexpected that the opposition has decided to initiate an ouster motion against Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik given new revelations that have put her in a ""complex and difficult position,"" according to Starič.

The biggest problem for Golob concerning Ajanović Hovnik is that she is the chief negotiator with trade unions, where a billion euros is at stake. ""If the prime minister replaced a key minister in the final phase of negotiations, this is a big problem for him,"" Starič said.

Coupled with criticism that the post-flood reconstruction has been sluggish, Golob had no other chance but to opt for a government reshuffle, which will redirect public attention to other ministers.

""The fact is, however, that the prime minister has targeted his ministers. These are not ministers whose departure would complicate relations in the coalition,"" she said.

Commenting on the nomination of Valentina Prevolnik Rupel for health minister, Starič said her starting position was not bad since she was not a novice at the ministry and she enjoyed the support of the strategic council for healthcare.",politics
Health digitalisation bill off parliament's agenda,"Coalition parties have withdrawn a key health reform bill, on digitalisation, from the agenda of an extraordinary session of the National Assembly scheduled for Friday, saying that there is not enough time to amend it in line with recommendations by the parliament's legal services.","The deputy groups of the Freedom Movement, Social Democrats and the Left withdrew the bill on Monday, two days before a planned session of the Health Committee, which needs to approve any amendments.

The parties said that there was not enough time ""to examine the opinion of the legal services and draft relevant amendments"". The National Assembly session scheduled for Friday is the last one planned before the summer break, which means the bill's passage will most likely be on the agenda in the autumn.

Released last Friday, the 49-page opinion of the legal services lists a number of shortcomings, mostly regarding clarity and goals of provisions on data processing.

Set to take effect on 1 January 2024, the bill aims to introduce digital transparency in healthcare, according to Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan, who resigned on Friday, citing conceptual differences with Prime Minister Robert Golob regarding the development of healthcare.

Under the bill, public healthcare providers will feed all medical data into a single IT system, managed, maintained and developed by a state-owned company.

The bill faced significant criticism while in public debate, including from the Information Commissioner. The ministry tried to address the concerns but evidently many issues remained.

The bill not only establishes individual bases of private data, it also connects these data bases, bringing them together in a single central healthcare IT system. Moreover, the private data in the IT system is also linked to basic medical charts kept by individual healthcare providers.

Such a massive data base increases the risk of private data breaches, such as unauthorised access, system breaches, and errors in accuracy and prompt keeping of data, the legal services warns.

The STA has learnt from unofficial sources that the bill will likely be on the National Assembly's agenda in autumn.",health
Coalition MPs express doubt in RTV supervisory board,"The Commission for Oversight of Public Finances discussed on Thursday a report on the supervisory board of public broadcaster RTV Slovenija in 2022. Coalition MPs expressed doubt that the supervisors did their job, with chief supervisor Borut Rončević saying it did.","According to Rončević, the supervisors acted strictly within the limits of their powers set by the law and the statute. However, the supervisory board does not run the institution, it is not the management or the disciplinary committee, he said.

Thus, he said that even the questions addressed to him today by the MPs should have been addressed to the management and to a lesser extent to the Programme Council. Representatives of the management of the institution did not attend today's meeting.

Nataša Sukič from the ruling coalition Left party said there was serious doubt as to whether the supervision in individual segments was really adequate and sufficient. She said the report did not show that the supervisory board had warned the RTV management of any irregularities or requested any additional explanations, let alone imposed any measures within its competence.

""Your report shows above all that you took note of the documents and obviously uncritically approved all the proposals made by the director general,"" she said.

Both Sukič and Tamara Vonta from the ruling Freedom Movement party pointed to certain developments at RTV which they believe affected the institution's business results. The ratings of some programmes on TV Slovenia are dropping, which will inevitably be reflected in lower commercial revenue, she said.

According to Sukič, RTV's finances are also affected by the human resources policy, hiring of new staff, forced retirements and severance payments. There have been more than 170 lay-off decisions issued, she said, adding that this raised doubts whether all this was in line with the law.

Vonta noted that in the draft annual report last December, the management had reported an operating loss of almost EUR 7.5 million, but two months later the picture was completely different and the broadcaster was said to be in the black.

She pointed out that such small broadcaster could not afford to have two programmes and two news desks. She wanted to know how the supervisory board felt about this and what the financial effects of this decision were, given that the news programme on TV SLO2 channel has shrunk to mere ten minutes.

Rončević said this was untrue, noting that part of the remarks should not be addressed to the supervisors, while some refer to the 2023 report. He said the report for last year had been prepared the same way as it had been in the last two years.

The commission voted to support the proposal that relevant authorities assess whether the chief superior and members of the supervisory board were indeed independent from the political parties that put them forward to their posts, and from the director general.

The commission's chair, Jernej Vrtovec from the opposition party New Slovenia (NSi), said this was a political judgement, so he voted against.",politics
Details on human rights in Slovenia available via online guide,"An online Human Rights Guide has been made available to anyone who would like to find out more about human rights in Slovenia in a comprehensive and transparent way. The platform, enabling self-help and education on human rights, is provided in Slovenian as well as in English and is based on a thematic approach.","The Peace Institute, a non-profit research institution, has explained that the guide helps the reader understand human rights in different areas of everyday life and develop the skills to apply them in concrete situations.

Accessible at https://www.clovekovepravice.si/en/themes, it covers several topics, including police custody and detention, as well as detention in immigration and asylum, noting for instance that such detention has to be carried out lawfully and non-arbitrarily, without inhumane treatment.

During the detention process, human rights such as the rights to liberty and security, to life, to privacy and the prohibition of inhumane, degrading treatment or torture may be violated.

The topic of courts and fair trials explains human rights in court proceedings and how they should be adequately protected.

The guide also explains the meaning of the concept of family and the situations that can most often concern an individual's reproductive rights, one's spousal or parental rights and obligations, or one's rights as a child.

Finally, it details what human rights are, lists Slovenian and international institutions for the protection of human rights, and provides directions on where to find help.

On some of the mentioned topics, the reader can use knowledge tests to assess their knowledge of human rights and the ability to apply them in various situations.

The Human Rights Guide was developed by the Baltic Human Rights Society in Riga. Slovenia joined in 2021, and participants so far also include Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia. France and Croatia are expected to join this year.",human interest
Slovenians getting day off on 14 August to help with flood relief,"The government decided on Tuesday to declare 14 August solidarity day, so citizens will get a day off to help with flood relief efforts. Announcing the decision on Instagram, Prime Minister Robert Golob said Slovenia wanted to wrap up the difficult period in the spirit of solidarity.","He said people would get a day off ""to help our acquaintance, neighbour, friend, everyone affected by the severe flooding"".

In a video address posted on his Instagram profile, Golob said that many initiatives and proposals had come from citizens in recent days in the face of the catastrophic floods. One of them was to declare 14 August a day off so that ""we can all show to those affected by the disaster that they are not alone"".

""So yes, the government decided that 14 August will be solidarity day. A day when the entire Slovenia will join forces and every one of us will contribute to the best of their abilities. I am convinced Slovenia can do that,"" Golob said.

Since 15 August, the Assumption of Mary, is a national holiday, Slovenians will now have four days off, weekend included.

The massive floods that hit the country at the end of last week have been termed the worst natural disaster since independence. Two-thirds of the country have been devastated and many have lost their homes. Six people are thought to have been killed in the storms.",disaster and accident

Exhibition on history of Bosnian language opens in ZRC atrium,"An exhibition documenting the history of literacy in the Bosnian language from the Middle Ages to recent history opened on Tuesday in the atrium of the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU) in Ljubljana. The organisers say it raises awareness of the Bosnian language and its history, which is lacking in Slovenia.","The exhibition, dubbed With a Letter about a Letter: Following the Trail of the Bosnian Written Heritage, has been set up in cooperation with the Language Institute of the University of Sarajevo and the Bosnian cultural association Preporod.

It showcases the history of literacy in the Bosnian language which, due to historical circumstances, has been very rich, diverse and complex, says the text accompanying the exhibition.

The Bosnian language was written in various scripts, from Glagolitic and its variants to modern Cyrillic and Latin as is known and used today.

The exhibition, authored by Preporod president Sanjin Kodrić and Erma Ramić-Kunić and Alen Kalajdžija of the Language Institute from Sarajevo, is one of the interpretations of the rich complexity and diversity of the Bosnian written tradition.

It is nevertheless an indication of the richness of the Bosnian written heritage, which is still insufficiently explored and known, and that is one of the reasons why the Bosnian language is less known and underappreciated, the authors add.

Kozma Ahačič, the head of the Slovenian Language Institute at the ZRC SAZU, told the STA on the occasion that the idea was to bring together all language institutes of the former Yugoslavia and revive that connection.

""Good relations and spreading of knowledge are very important for all immigrants from the republics of the former joint state, because good knowledge of one's mother tongue is essential for good knowledge of Slovenian,"" he added.

Ahačič said in his address at the exhibition opening that Bosnia and Herzegovina and its capital Sarajevo ""are certainly a global centre ... where accepting differences and implementing multilingualism is not only a pose, but part of everyday life.""

When Slovenians discuss why there are the Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin languages, and not only the Serbo-Croatian, ""then we have to remind ourselves all over again that we actually know very little about his. Shamefully little.""

He also told the STA on the sidelines of the event that the adjective Bosnian no longer had a pejorative connotation that it used to have, and that the noun Bosnian did not have this connotation either.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Strategic partnership launches innovative processing of biomass,"Circular Economy, a strategic development and innovation partnership, and the company Helios TBLUS presented a pilot project in which a reactor system will be used for innovative processing of biomass into bio-based resins and coatings. The equipment will be available to all partners in the project and to other companies, they said on Tuesday.","As part of the joint project of transferring technology from lab-scale to pilot-scale, research equipment for the optimisation and transfer of innovative technology based on sustainable resource management will be used in practice in the industry, the Štajerska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which manages the Circular Economy, said.

Waste biomass from the wood and agricultural industries will be used as feedstock for the products. The Institute of Chemistry is in charge of the development part of the project, while the equipment will be available not only to partners in the project but also to other companies.

""Increasing the use of bio-based materials will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the polymer industry and enable the production of environmentally and human-friendly products,"" the partners believe.

The whole investment is worth EUR 323,000, with the state covering half of the costs and the partners in the project the other half.

""Progress in science and technology enables the development of high-quality products that are environmentally friendly and comply with strict Slovenian and EU environmental legislation. We see our participation in the partnership as an important competitive advantage in Europe's demanding markets,"" said Helios TBLUS CEO Peter Venturini.

Head of the Štajerska Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aleksandra Podgornik said that in the face of climate change and other challenges circular activities were essential for the future of business.

""Companies that adopted sustainability visions years ago are now more competitive and perform better. We need comprehensive and revolutionary change, which requires broad alliances and collaborations such as the ones we are successfully developing in the Circular Economy,"" she added.

RTV Slovenija boss has no intention of resigning,Acting director general at RTV Slovenija Andrej Grah Whatmough has no intention of resigning after the Higher Labour Court found his January 2021 appointment unlawful and the public broadcaster's works council and journalist trade union urged him to step down.,"The court has ruled that his appointment, challenged by his predecessor Igor Kadunc, was unlawful as he lacked three years of experience to run large business systems.

Speaking to the press on Wednesday, Grah Whatmough said that the court's arguments concern businesses rather than public organisations such as RTV.

He said the December 2020 call for applications set three years of experience in running large systems as a job requirement, while the broadcaster's statute did not.

""This opens the question of whether the call for applications was in line with the statute,"" he said, reiterating that he meets the criteria to be director general.

After he started his term in April 2021, Grah Whatmough formally resigned in 2022 asking the programme council to reappoint him, which happened in March 2022.

The new call for applications no longer required three years of managerial experience, it only said that managerial experience is required.

Grah Whatmough said today that RTV will lodge an appeal at the Supreme Court because the Higher Court's ruling is totally opposed to that of the first-instance court.

He believes that the Higher Court's ruling in fact upholds the RTV management's warnings, although it has no bearing on the broadcaster's operations.

While Grah Whatmough was appointed for a full term in March 2022, he was relegated to acting capacity as the changes to the RTV legislation entered into force last December until new management is appointed in accordance with the new law.

Asked why the management continues to appoint editors while being in acting capacity, he said editor appointment is part of business that needs to be attended to.

Every media outlet must have editors, and the terms of several editors at RTV have expired since the new legislation entered into force, he explained.",education
Moderate optimism ahead of UN Security Council vote (background),"The UN General Assembly will hold elections for new non-permanent members of the UN Security Council for 2024-2025 on 6 June, with Slovenia, along with Belarus, vying for a seat in the Eastern European Group. Slovenian officials have been cautiously optimistic ahead of the vote, mired as it is in geopolitical confrontations over Ukraine.","Slovenia was already a member of the UN Security Council in 1998-1999, when it was elected in the first round despite having two competitors in Macedonia and Belarus. In 2011, Slovenia made another attempt but was defeated by Azerbaijan after a marathon voting session.

The decision to reapply was made by the government of Janez Janša at the end of 2021. It was speculated at the time that this was done at the initiative of the US, which did not want Belarus to be the sole candidate. The former prime minister confirmed this a few days ago.

The government of Robert Golob continued the bid, whereby Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon has described it as a national rather than a government project.

The Foreign Ministry has remained tight-lipped about how many votes Slovenia is projected to get, but Fajon has been repeating that there is reason for moderate optimism.

Experts, including Slovenia's former ambassador to the UN Roman Kirn, for the most part argue that it is unlikely Slovenia will secure victory already in the first round of voting.

Andrej Logar, a former ambassador to the UN, also feels it is possible that additional rounds of voting will be needed. ""However, if it's hard for us to get [the required] two-thirds of the vote, it's even harder for Belarus,"" he told the STA.

Initially, Slovenia seemed to have relatively poor chances, as Belarus initiated its candidacy already back in 2007 and received many pledges of support after that. However, Belarus becoming Russia's key ally in the aggression against Ukraine last year could have tilted the balance in favour of Slovenia.

Resolutions of the UN General Assembly against war showed that the vast majority of the world, or about 140 countries, condemns the Russian aggression. This is roughly the number of votes Slovenia received during the 1997 candidacy. If all 193 members of the UN General Assembly vote, 129 votes are needed for success.

The war in Ukraine is by no means the only factor that will determine how countries vote, but it is not insignificant. Belarus has not been campaigning for election in any noteworthy way, as it counts on Russian support.

On the other hand, Slovenia has avoided emphasizing its clear support from the US and the EU, as this is not always popular within the UN, especially among African and Latin American countries.

Kirn argue that ""this election is a prisoner of the current geopolitical confrontation as a consequence of the war in Ukraine"". ""The view of this crisis from New York differs from the view in Ljubljana or Brussels. Many countries, particularly smaller ones, are hesitant to align themselves amidst such a confrontational scenario,"" he remarked.

Slovenian diplomacy has invested significant efforts in recent months to gain support from African countries. Many were visited by high-ranking Slovenian representatives, and Slovenia has opened an embassy in Addis Ababa, where the African Union is also headquartered. Special envoy Franc But spent a significant amount of time there.

Contacts with Latin American and Caribbean countries have been boosted as well, while Foreign Minister Fajon also visited Asia shortly before the vote in the UN General Assembly.

For now, major powers have not publicly declared their support. However, experts expect pressure from both sides if things are not decided in the first or second round of voting.

Analysts have not noticed any significant campaign by China in favour of Belarus. UN director at the International Crisis Group Richard Gowan told the STA that there have not been many signs validating fears China would get involved.

Gowan feels Beijing only wants to let Russia and Belarus know that it is on their side, while it actually has not been doing much. The UN expert argued Slovenia had led a good, subtle campaign, avoiding too much focus on Ukraine.

There is also speculation that Belarus could withdraw its candidacy if it deems it has no chance of being elected. It would likely justify such a move with claims of injustice, Western imperialism, and similar arguments.

Slovenia's advantage is that it practically has no enemies in the international community, but it is not well known in many countries whose support it needs.

In its candidacy, Slovenia has highlighted issues such as human rights, climate change, opposition to war and nuclear weapons, children's rights, and assistance to developing countries.

Meanwhile, Slovenian politics has for the most part been united in the project and Logar has acknowledged the intensive efforts of the new government abroad.

He however feels the government had not done a good enough job at presenting the candidacy at home, where ""people interpret this as something only serving politicians, even though it is an important component of our foreign policy strategy.""

UN expert Gowan has noted that Slovenia, if appointed, would serve as the voice of Eastern Europe in the Security Council in a potential situation where the war in Ukraine continues and Ukraine needs help.

It would also be a representative of the EU in relations with the rest of the world, which is a historic chance for such a small country that also comes with many opportunities for networking and economic diplomacy.",politics
Army chief of staff calls for more engineers among reserves,"As the medium-term defence programme for 2023-2028 was presented to the parliamentary Defence Committee on Thursday, Major General Robert Glavaš, the chief of the general staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, said engineers of defence companies that work with the army should be attracted to the army reserves.","Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said one of the goals of the medium-term defence programme was raising the share of investment to 20% of defence budget and raising the funds for research and development to 2%.

The latter will enable the marketing of the know-how of the Slovenian economy, Šarec said, noting that the ministry had just signed an agreement with two universities.

Welcoming the planned raising of defence spending to 2% of GDP, the minister said that this would be seen as the lower and no longer the upper limit at the upcoming NATO summit. ""Slovenia is not in a good situation here,"" he said.

Glavaš said that the priorities included the part of modernisation of the army that was important, pointing to the forming of two battalion groups that are important for NATO and the opportunity for soldiers to be trained on new capabilities to keep up with development trends.

He also pointed to the purchase of helicopters that will contribute to the army's dual function, in the field of rescue and protection, and to modernisation of infrastructure, which is crucial for creating a pleasant working environment and attracting more people into the army.

Glavaš said that talks were under way with Slovenian companies that cooperate with the defence system on having their mechanics and engineers join the army as reserves. He said they would be useful in case of problems with the new equipment. ""They would be called in for a day or two to help us solve these problems,"" he said.

Reserve soldiers are currently not included in battalions, but Glavaš said this was to change, as contract soldiers too should have a proper job and training.

According to the chief of the general staff, the Slovenian army is changing, as new defence systems are being introduced, and therefore some forces need to be merged or new ones created. The medium-term programme envisages a new formation of an artillery battalion to gradually build up a self-propelled artillery.

The radiological, chemical and biological defence battalion is also to be formed again and an air defence formation introduced such the army has not had before. According to Glavaš, talks on military formations were still under way.

Matej Tonin from the opposition New Slovenia (NSi) asked when the ministry planned to reveal that after cancelling the deal on the purchase of Boxer armoured personnel carriers it was buying eight-wheelers as an alternative which are built under a licence from the US company General Dynamics.

Šarec said he would not comment on the ongoing selection procedure for the eight-wheelers, because the vehicles would be picked based on offers and characteristics. He said the process was in the final phase.

The medium-term defence programme for 2023-2028 is the Defence Ministry's key document implementing a resolution on the general long-term development of the Slovenian army until 2035 that was adopted in March.",education

The project won public and EU funds as part of the strategy of local development in the region of Istria in 2021, but to have the centre the way the association had imagined it, they have launched a fundraiser aiming to raise EUR 5,000 by the end of July.

Morigenos is an organisation that largely consists of volunteers who monitor and study dolphins in Slovenian and surrounding waters. For the past 20 years, their research has been contributing to the understanding and protection of dolphins and the conservation of marine ecosystems.

Looking at its beginnings, Genov said when he received the Prometheus of Science award for excellence in science communication for 2021 that his ambition to monitor dolphins had been met with doubt, as many had argued there were no dolphins in the Slovenian sea. Now the dolphin population in the Gulf of Trieste is one of the most researched ones in the entire Mediterranean Sea.",human interest
Pirc Musar co-chairs UN event discussing digital technologies,"President Nataša Pirc Musar and Kenyan President William Ruto co-chaired in New York on Monday one of the six leaders' dialogues discussing digital technologies as part of the UN Development Summit. The 26 speakers, including 16 presidents, raised some interesting points on how technology can help with sustainable development, she said.","The leaders' dialogue on using science, technology, innovation and data to accelerate transformation was one of six such events at the Development Summit, hosted by the president of the 78th UN General Assembly, Dennis Francis, to advance the Sustainable Development Goals.

In 2015, UN member states set 17 development goals, including ending poverty and hunger. The world is lagging behind in implementing these goals, partly because of the Covid-19 pandemic and various crises, such as the war in Ukraine.

So far, only about 15% of the goals have been reached and according to Pirc Musar there was a lot of talk on how to accelerate this. The world is full of conflicts, UN reform is urgently needed, and climate change is one of the topics that should be discussed.

Pirc Musar told Slovenian reporters it was disastrous that the goals were being implemented so slowly. She said things needed to be shifted up a gear if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, for example.

""The UN is the only multilateral platform we have where we can all speak together on these issues, and perhaps small countries sometimes don't realise enough that one country means one voice, and that the more small countries join forces the better,"" she said.

""Slovenia is one of the initiators of the proposal to Secretary-General Guterres for a special envoy on water, and I presented this at the UN Water Conference in March this year. Believe me, water will certainly be a cause of future conflicts,"" she said.

On Monday, Pirc Musar met with Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, Kazakh President Kasim-Jomart Tokayev and the president of the UN General Assembly, Dennis Francis. She also attended a reception hosted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Today she will address the UN General Assembly, stressing among other things gender equality and an initiative to have more female presidents of the UN General Assembly in the future.

""The statistics are appalling, with 74 sessions so far chaired by men and only four by women. The idea is to alternate women and men in this position every year,"" she said, adding that Francis had told her to keep talking boldly about it.

She will also keep talking about artificial intelligence and the fight against disinformation. ""This is an evil that brings great harm to democracies around the world. The UN is the ideal platform where we can come together and make an app that can detect disinformation. I have spoken to the presidents of Kazakhstan and Ghana about this,"" she said.","unrest, conflicts and war"

European Youth Olympic Festival opening in Maribor,"The summer edition European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF) is opening in Maribor on Sunday, bringing together some 2,400 young athletes from 48 countries to compete in 11 sports. The festival with a rich accompanying programme will run until 29 July. Entry to most venues will be free.","The festival will open on Sunday evening with a ceremony at the Ljudski Vrt stadium following the motto ""the youth for the youth"".

Slovenian athletes have been taking part in the EYOF competitions since the first one, held in 1991 in Brussels. This year the country will be represented by a 138-strong team.

At the EYOF 2,421 athletes will compete in 11 sports. New this year are skating, mountain biking and 3x3 basketball. Other sports are gymnastics, athletics, road cycling, handball, judo, swimming, tennis and volleyball.

The competitions will be held in different venues across Maribor, including the Maribor Airport, where the road cycling time trials will take place.

The accompanying programme will include concerts, tours around Maribor, sports presentations and competitions.

""Excellent athletes are coming to Maribor and many people with them,"" the organisers said ahead of the festival, adding that all accommodation capacities in the city are fully booked. Accommodation for athletes is organised in hotels but also in student housing.

A lot of the work will be done by volunteers. Some 800 have responded to the call and nearly 200 will be coming from abroad.

The municipality received state funding to renovate two venues ahead of the EYOF. The works on one have not been fully completed, both will be able to host the competitions.

The state will contribute EUR 2.8 million for the event, which was not confirmed until mid-May, so the organisers were at the verge of cancelling the event.

Total costs are estimated at EUR 11 million, the rest of which will be covered by the municipality, the Olympic Committee, Erasmus tenders, entry fees and sponsorships.

""The goal is not just sport but also connections. What will be left (after the festival) is a lot of good energy and new sports infrastructure,"" said Maribor Mayor Saša Arsenovič.

The local tourist board estimates that attendees and visitors will spend some 30,000 nights in Maribor, marking the peak of the tourist season.

The EYOF is one of the largest multi-sport events in Europe and the largest event for athletes between the ages of 14 and 18.

Slovenia has hosted the winter edition of the festival once before, in 2003 in Bled, but this is the first time the summer edition is taking place in the country.",sport
Fmr Slovenian and Croatian presidents mark Croatia's EU accession anniversary,"Former presidents of Croatia and Slovenia, Jadranka Kosor and Borut Pahor, met on the Metlika-Jurovski Brod border crossing on Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of Croatia's EU membership.","Addressing the event, Pahor said that Croatia's accession to the EU had been in the hands of the Slovenian nation.

After 18 years of discord, Slovenians approved in a 2010 referendum a border arbitration agreement brokered just six months earlier by Kosor and Pahor, the latter said.

After the agreement was signed, Slovenia withdrew its reservations, allowing Croatia to become the 28th member of the bloc. ""Despite a very tough financial and economic situation, Slovenians were wise enough to look into the future,"" Pahor said.

""This must not be forgotten,"" neither by Slovenians, nor the Croatian people. ""To appreciate the decision that was made,"" said Pahor.

The arbitration agreement paved the way for an international arbitration and a ruling, which Croatia refuses to recognise. Pahor said that ""sooner or later wise people will see that there is no alternative"".

Kosor talked about the development of events over a decade ago, saying that she and Pahor managed to resolve the dispute between their countries because of their ""mutual and honest friendship"".

She said that their biggest achievement had been the restoration of trust between the two nations. All of this would not have happened had they not ""taken on a heavy burden"", she told the event organised by Anno 93, an organisation of Croatians living in Vienna.",politics
Patient Associations speak up on healthcare reforms,"The Union of Patient Associations of Slovenia has presented its views on healthcare reforms at a press conference on Thursday, saying that it welcomes changes in governance of the ZZZS public health insurer and believes that top-up health insurance should be abolished only if the resulting obligatory contributions would be proportional to income.","The union believes that the proposed two-tier system separating management and supervisors in the ZZZS public health insurer is a step in the right direction but it has to be implemented consistently, said the Chair of the Committee on Legislation and Legal Aid for Patients Rado Bohinc.

The supervisory board should include representatives of employees and patients, while the administration should acquire full managerial powers, including programme and financial planning.

Bohinc noted that a new public agency should be founded and take over regulatory, expert, development and monitoring tasks of ZZZS. The new agency would set rules, prices and quality standards and monitor the implementation.

Then, founder powers for public health centres would be transferred from the state and municipalities to a new state-owned healthcare holding that would manage and monitor public healthcare centres, Bohinc said. The public company developing the central information system under the digitalisation of healthcare bill should also be included in the proposed holding structure.

Bohinc was critical of the proposed changes to the institutes act, saying that the changes should implement a two-tier management system, similar to the one proposed for the ZZZS. Naming directors is a professional, not a political task, said Bohinc, adding that it should be left to supervisory boards.

Patient associations support the abolishment of top-up health insurance but are in favour of progressive or wage-related contributions. The union sees opportunities for improvement in better organisation, management and rational use of resources.

The union believes that the second part of the healthcare reform should focus on quality and safety. Their proposals include an independent public surveillance body, decriminalisation of human errors and legislation on the quality and safety of healthcare and non-fault damages, said Franc Zalar, Chair of the Committee on Patient Safety and Healthcare Quality.

The union's Vice-president Franci Gerbec said that the healthcare reform is necessary but that all stakeholders must maintain dialogue and tolerance. The union is advocating for a patient-first healthcare system.",health
RTV Slovenija management seeking a meeting with EU Commission,Acting director of public broadcaster RTV Slovenija Andrej Grah Whatmough has sent a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova requesting a meeting to present the situation at the RTV and in the Slovenian media.,"Whatmough says in the public letter that despite the government's assurances that it will strive for a free and high-quality media, its actions related to RTV show the exact opposite.

Since the start of this government's term, the RTV management has been subject to ""clear political pressure"" which the ruling politicians openly express in their statements, Whatmough says.

He points to Culture Minister Asta Vrečko recently saying that the RTV management needs to be replaced and PM Robert Golob saying that they are looking for loopholes to replace the management at the public broadcaster.

Whatmough also expressed concern about the pressure on the Constitutional Court, which is currently deliberating on the changes to the RTV Slovenija Act, after staying certain provisions of the amended law.

Golob recently urged the court to make a decision about the law quickly so that ""we will get the whole thing into our hands again"", Whatmough says, adding that the PM's words show he does not understand the basic principles of the rule of law.

""The division into three branches of power is essential for the rule of law. While it would be naive to expect the branches to act completely independently of each other, such blatant attempts at influencing and pressuring (the court) raise serious concerns that Slovenian society and the state are developing in an undemocratic direction,"" he adds.

""The management of RTV Slovenija wants the public media service to be able to breathe freely and independently after years of political influence and meddling. We have no doubt that this goal could be more easily achieved with the help and support of the European Union, where media freedom is high on the list of European values,"" he adds.

This is why the management of RTV asks the Commission president and vice-president for a meeting to present them the actual functioning of RTV and developments related to the broadcaster as well as its view of the media situation in Slovenia.",politics
Lady Justice visits Ljubljana to warn of human rights violations,A giant balloon installation by environmental activist Alban Grosdidier was set up near the parliament house in Ljubljana on Monday. Lady Justice warns of a proposed EU directive that would make EU companies liable for human rights violations and damage to the environment.,"The EU directive, which the European Commission presented in February 2022, is to encourage companies to act in a sustainable and responsible manner in all global value chains.

Grosdidier, who brought Lady Justice to Ljubljana from Vienna before taking it to Stockholm, pointed to the many activists killed in the fight against the exploitation of the Earth's resources and the current situation where companies in the EU are not held accountable for human rights violations and destroying the environment.

""With the new directive, we have the power to change the accountability of European companies,"" he was quoted as saying a press release.

Noting that only large companies would be included in the legislation, he rejected claims that this would destroy small businesses.

""We all want to live in a world where human rights and the environment are respected. It turned out that voluntary commitments by companies do not solve problems, so we want companies operating in the EU to respect the environment and human rights and foremost not to commit human rights violations and increase their impact on the environment for the sake of profits,"" said Živa Kavka Gobbo, head of NGO Focus, which leads the campaign in Slovenia.

Elena Lunder, a Focus member, said the European network of NGOs was pushing for the new rules to cover the entire value chain of companies. ""It is imperative that the legislation includes all human rights, labour rights and environmental standards.""

NGOs also believe it is essential that legislation includes corporate civil liability.

Human Rights Ombudsman Peter Svetina also expressed support to the campaign. ""Businesses have a duty to protect human rights and the environment. Given the climate crisis, which we have also experienced in Slovenia with the recent catastrophic floods, it is clear that companies must also change their strategies and business operations immediately,"" said Svetina.

It is high time for strong legislation to be adopted at EU level demanding that companies carefully scrutinise their compliance with human rights and environmental standards. Those responsible in companies must be held responsible, while legal protection must be provided to the victims, the ombudsman said.

He expects the Slovenian government to take a firm stance in the negotiations on the directive.",environmental issue

"Von der Leyen and Pirc Musar talk aid, climate change",President Nataša Pirc Musar met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as the latter visited flood-struck areas in Slovenia on Wednesday. The pair exchanged information about the situation and about plans for EU assistance in relief efforts. Both emphasised the need to strengthen the fight against climate change.,"Von der Leyen expressed deep sympathy with the people of Slovenia whose lives have been impacted by the floods. She was impressed by the solidarity seen and praised the rapid response of the national protection and rescue system.

Pirc Musar thanked von der Leyen for the Commission's swift response and the expressed solidarity. She also highlighted the importance of close cooperation among EU members to protect against natural disasters.

""I express my gratitude to all the statesmen and citizens of neighbouring countries, states in the region, and the EU who responded immediately and sent help to Slovenia. Kindness begets kindness, Slovenia is grateful,"" Pirc Musar said.

The meeting between the two presidents was primarily focused on recovery aid possibilities for the affected areas. Von der Leyen reiterated that the EU will provide assistance through various mechanisms.

The pair dedicated special attention to the impact of climate change. They emphasised the need for a further laying down of measures to combat climate change in order to adapt to the new circumstances.

Accompanied by Prime Minister Robert Golob and European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič, the Commission president visited by helicopter today some of the areas hit worst by the floods last weekend.

Von der Leyen, who also addressed parliament and met with locals in Črna na Koroškem, announced Slovenia will get EUR 400 million from the EU Solidarity Fund, EUR 100 million this year and EUR 300 million in 2024.",disaster and accident
Interior Ministry denies allegations of mass deportations,"The Interior Ministry says claims of mass deportations of migrants from Slovenia to Croatia and Bulgaria are misinformation, while acting Interior Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik has requested a report for the case of a Pakistani international protection seeker that was returned to his country in January.","The claims of mass deportations come as a response to the violations by the Centre for Foreigners in the asylum seeking process of the Pakistani citizen.

According to a civil initiative, the Pakistani was interviewed without legal counsel and with interpretation into a language he did not understand well. He was deceived that he would be allowed to stay in the country if he withdrew his application for international protection, but was instead returned to Pakistan upon withdrawing it.

Ambasada Rog, a civil initiative that helps refugees obtain asylum status, said that, on the basis of that case, they presume that the Interior Ministry continues to mass deport refugees to Croatia and Bulgaria, ""not respecting the principle of not returning refugees to countries in which they could be subjected to torture or degrading treatment.""

The ministry denied these accusations of mass deportations to Croatia and Bulgaria, adding that in 2022 the police delivered eight asylums seekers to Croatia and none to Bulgaria. In 2023, they have only delivered one to Croatia.

Slovenia is subject to EU law, including the Dublin regulation, which lays down the criteria for determining the EU member state responsible for examining an application for asylum, the ministry explained. Courts have already ruled on whether asylum seekers handed over to Croatia are at risk there.

Ambasada Rog said that the Pakistani asylum seeker was staying in a centre where his movement was restricted and he was unable to contact his legal counsels, resulting in his being returned to his country.

The civil initiative claims that the Centre for Foreigners is like a camp where people are unlawfully detained, have their documents confiscated and are tortured.

Slovenian and international oversight bodies, including the Slovenian Human Rights Ombudsman, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, and the Schengen Evaluation, have not been able to confirm these claims.

The ministry explained that the Centre for Foreigners is a police institution where movement of foreign citizens undergoing return proceedings is restricted and where applicants for international protection can be detained following a decision of the Interior Ministry.

The police is striving to create living conditions that reach a high level of human rights and freedoms, the ministry noted. ""We achieve all that with professional staff and improving living conditions for all persons in the Centre for Foreigners, for which the police successfully obtains European funds.""","crime, law and justice"
Transfer of knowledge to be key in organic farming,"Transfer of knowledge will be key in increasing the share of lands used for organic farming from 11% to 18% by 2027 and to 25% by 2030, says the Union of Organic Farmers' Associations Slovenia (ZDEKS) that held a panel discussion on the topic on Tuesday.","Organic farming is one of the key areas of the green transition and other related European strategic documents. Slovenia has committed to the goal of increasing the share of land used for organic farming from 11% to 18% by 2027. The EU-wide strategy Farm to Fork plans to reach a 25% share by 2030, said ZDEKS at the discussion.

Looking at the past growth and efforts, ZDEKS says the goals will be difficult to reach. If the principle ""business as usual"" is applied, Slovenia would only reach 14% by 2027, according to projections from 2021. Failing to meet the goals would mean a substantial loss of funds from the EU, ZDEKS said.

It is important to increase both the extent and the quality of activities when including new farmers into organic farming, advising them and transferring knowledge, the organisation noted.

ZDEKS expects that the country will support all related institutions and their cooperation and publicly express support for organic farming. ""There is a lot of talk about local self-sufficiency and local food but we should also hear that the country's highest representatives support organic farming,"" Uroš Brankovič from ZDEKS told the STA.

The organisation hopes to receive funds that would allow them to hire an expert. Currently they are working on a mostly voluntary basis which has not shown desired results.

""When organisations in other countries employed experts, they were able to obtain funds from other sources. And since results were better for farmers, farmers also contributed more,"" Brankovič said.

Slovenia does not have enough organic farming advisors or enough model farms, ZDEKS said, mentioning Germany and Austria as examples of best practice. In Austria just the organisation BIO Austria employs more than 100 experts that work alongside the agriculture chamber experts. A series of institutions ensure the development of new technologies.

Today's panel is part of the project FOR Organic Farming, Environment Protection and Health that is funded by the Active Citizens Fund. The project is organised by ZDEKS in partnership with PRO-BIO, a Czech association for organic farming.

ZDEKS unites six associations with a total of 500 members. Slovenia has around 3,500 organic farmers, said Brankovič.",environmental issue
EU Commission sees improvement on Austrian-Slovenian border,"Border control consultations launched by the European Commission in May have led to an improvement on the Austrian-Slovenian border, as the number of illegal crossings has dropped, the Commission's spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Tuesday as she commented on Germany's and Poland's plan to introduce controls on the bloc's internal borders.","She reiterated the Commission's position that internal border controls can only be introduced as a measure of last resort and must be limited in duration.

She added that the Commission was in close contact with member states and had launched in May official consultations with the countries performing border controls and those affected by it.

This includes Austria and Slovenia. The former introduced border controls during the height of the 2015 migrations crisis and extended it in six-months intervals ever since, with Slovenia protesting the measure the entire time.

Hipper said that improvements had been seen in some parts, including in Austria and Slovenia, adding that there had been a drop in the number of illegal border crossings.

"Večer finds politicians immature, unable to cooperate","As Večer comments on Saturday on the announced no-shows for today's Statehood Day ceremony, it says that the divisions between the main political players, who are not able to show up in the full line-up at the ceremony due to ideological barriers, show their immaturity and the lack of ability to cooperate.","""Since they are not able to offer substantive solutions, they resort to proven populist tricks and adding fuel to the culture war, which constantly inhibits social development and burdens people with negative energy,"" the newspaper says in Unpredictable.

It adds that after 32 years of being an independent country, Slovenia cannot be proud of its political arena, because there are too many ""ego trips, narcissists, materialists and imaginary elitists operate in it.""

Večer argues that the common characteristic of the main political players in Slovenia is their insincerity. ""A year after the change in power, even the record election winner Robert Golob, as the latest liberal messiah, has not been able to break with the old practices.""

This has increased disappointment among his voters and empties the political space, which is being penetrated by Janez Janša and his satellites in line with a familiar scenario, concludes the commentary.",politics
Trade union calls for pension raises (adds),"The Slovenian Pensioners' Trade Union highlighted at a press conference on Tuesday the difficult situation pensioners face in light of inflation and food price hikes, calling on the government to green-light an additional adjustment and an extraordinary adjustment of pensions.","Trade union representatives said that despite the regular pension adjustment in February last year and bonuses in November and December 2022, pensions had not kept pace with the inflation rate. Additionally, the extraordinary adjustment last month only remedied the situation caused by piecemeal adjustments to pensions after 2010, they said.

Now the trade union expects the government to make an additional pension adjustment of 1% and an extraordinary adjustment of 4.4%.

They highlighted that last year the annual inflation rate, measured by the harmonised consumer price index, hit 10.8%, and the prices of foodstuff and non-alcoholic beverages went up by 19.3% on annual level.

""It is safe to say that pensions have been lagging behind,"" said the trade union's president Francka Ćetković, adding that a welfare state must make sure the elderly can live a decent life in accordance with the constitution and EU legislation.

As pensioners are facing a very difficult situation, the trade union first calls on the government to adopt a regular pension adjustment, which is expected to stand at around 5%.

The final decision on the increase will be made at Thursday's session of the public pension fund ZPIZ, whose financial plan foresaw a 4.9% regular adjustment from 1 January this year.

The 2021 pension adjustment under the previous government was too low, the trade union also said, adding that its goal was to raise the average pension so it reached 72% of the average pay. According to the latest data, the average pension amounts to 56.9% of the average pay.

Ćetković dismissed any potential accusations that the trade union's proposal would undermine fiscal stability, saying that contributions from the state budget into the public pension fund were decreasing on an annual basis.

She said that the government could secure additional funds by increasing employer pension contributions and by taxing high profits, as Prime Minister Robert Golob, she added, had promised to do some time ago.

Responding, the Labour Ministry told the STA that it was aware of the issues many pensioners faced as a result of the current situation. As part of a reform of pension and disability legislation, the ministry seeks to address pensioners' problems by working on a number of possible new models of the pension system.

This year's pension increase will be unveiled on Wednesday, the ministry said, and pensions are expected to rise by some 5%. ""In total, this will result in an annual increase of around EUR 320 million for pensions.""

The trade union also mentioned an analysis of the pensioners' socio-economic situation that was commissioned by ZPIZ upon the trade union's proposal. The findings showed that between 2010 and 2020, pensioners were worse off than the rest of the population.

Around 24% of them receive a pension of less than EUR 600 so the trade union will continue to call for changes to legislation on care allowance to make it more accessible to the elderly and to raise their standard of living, Ćetković said.",labour
Slovenian Brewers issue BeerPass guide for tourists,"The Association of Slovenian Brewers, which includes industrial as well as craft brewers, took the opportunity of International Beer Day on Friday to present the BeerPass guide. The project has a distinct tourist aspect, boosting connections and market presence and showcasing Slovenia as a land of beer.","Despite beer being an important part of Slovenian gastronomic and tourist offerings, the ""beer passport"" project seeks to further enhance the role of this beverage in Slovenian tourism, said Andrej Sluga, the president of the Association of Slovenian Brewers with the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS).

The project aims to promote responsible alcohol consumption, strengthen beer drinking culture, and familiarise beer lovers with Slovenia's key tourist attractions.

BeerPass is essentially a guide that leads consumers to 15 breweries across the country, allowing them to explore different types of beer.

According to Tatjana Zagorc, director of the Chamber of Agricultural and Food Enterprises at the GZS, brewers in Slovenia, where small breweries account for only 2% of sales, are following brewing development trends, expanding their offerings, and enhancing the quality of their products.

Business data shows that last year Slovenia had 99 breweries with about 620 employees in total. The value added in this sector reached EUR 70 million last year, while value added per employee stood at around EUR 113,000.

In 2022, Slovenian brewers produced 2.2 million hectolitres of beer. Approximately 1.6 million hectolitres of beer were consumed or used in other ways in Slovenia last year, with per capita consumption reaching 76 litres. The retail sector accounted for 67% of beer sales, while the hospitality sector accounted for the remaining 33%, Zagorc said.

The BeerPass project brought together 15 Slovenian brewers, including Clef, Crazy Duck, Green Gold, Lobik, Loo-blah-nah, Maister, Pivovarna Maribor, Reservoir Dogs, Reset, Tektonik, Time, Pivovarna Union, Vizir, Zajc, as well as the state's Institute for Hop Research and Brewing.

Finance committee opposes planned sale of Sports Lottery,"Members of the Finance Committee voiced opposition to the planned sale of sports betting monopoly Sports Lottery as they debated the issue on Thursday. Both opposition and coalition MPs said that the sale to a foreign fund would affect sports in Slovenia, especially from the financing point of view.","The emergency session of the parliamentary body had been requested by the opposition Democrats (SDS), with MP Franc Breznik noting the media reports about the three owners of Sports Lottery - the Ski Association of Slovenia, the Olympic Committee of Slovenia and the Football Association of Slovenia, intending to sell their stakes to a foreign fund.

The sports betting company is also indirectly owned by the state, as its largest owners are state-owned companies - the postal operator Pošta Slovenije and the lottery operator Loterija Slovenije, each with a 20% share.

The three sports associations each hold between 17 and 20% in Sports Lottery, Breznik noted, arguing that the sale of their stakes to a foreign fund would harm sports in Slovenia, especially in terms of financing.

He mentioned the sale of the flag carrier Adria Airways to a foreign fund. ""The majority of such sales have ended in failure.""

Finance Ministry State Secretary Nikolina Prah said that the finance minister, when giving consent for the sale of shares in such companies, took into account in particular the saturation of the gaming market, the impact on the social, cultural and natural environment, the credit rating of the acquirer and its experience in the gaming industry.

""The ministry is currently considering one application for the acquisition of shares in Sports Lottery, and I note again that each application is decided on with due diligence,"" she said.

Dejan Židan, the state secretary at the Economy, Tourism and Sport Ministry, noted the recent decreasing trend in the public funding of sports. The burden is increasingly falling on the parents of children who want to play sports, he added.

Representatives of the three sports associations listed among the reasons for thinking about selling the stakes past attempts at liberalisation of the sports betting market. This would greatly undermine the Sports Lottery, they assessed.

Matic Švab of the Olympic Committee of Slovenia said that the committee had so far received one offer from ""one of the main players in the global market"", and that no decision had been made yet.

Mladen Čičmir of the Football Association of Slovenia dismissed concerns that the potential sale could have negative consequences on sports in Slovenia.

The Sports Foundation, which receives funds from concession fees from sports betting, meanwhile strongly opposes the sale, with its president Branko Zorman arguing that the heads of the Olympic committee and the ski association had no mandate to discuss the sale.

The sale is also opposed by the Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia and the the Foundation for Funding Disability and Humanitarian Organisations, which gets a share of the Sports Lottery's profits.

MPs from the coalition parties were thus against the sale to a foreign fund, expressing concern about the potential negative consequences on society, in particular from the point of view of addiction to gaming.

They also raised the issue of social responsibility of the owners of Sports Lottery towards the community, and proposed that the committee express its opposition to the sale due to the lack of comprehensive impact analyses.

The proposal received sufficient support, and it was also backed by the opposition deputies. The proposal from the SDS that the committee call on Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič not to give consent for the sale of Sports Lottery was rejected.",sport
Delo looks at dilemmas of EU's green transition,"Europe sees itself as a leader in green transition, which is true in terms of goals yet the reality is a bit more complicated, especially when it comes to transport and a narrow range of new technologies, Delo says in its front-page commentary on Friday.","Electric mobility is being offered as an excellent solution, but Delo says there are no assessments of how battery imports will affect the competitiveness of the European car industry and the price of cars.

""The traffic collapses Slovenia is now experiencing on a daily basis will not be eliminated by electric vehicles alone.""

Under the headline Two Tonnes of Material to Transport One Person, Delo says that in Slovenia many cars, which are getting bigger and heavier, usually transport only one person, which means that one person is being transported by two tonnes of material, including hazardous, even on very short routes.

""As long as personal mobility is so energy-intensive, whether the car runs on petrol or electricity, Europe will never be energy self-sufficient.""

A zero-energy house with a solar plant, a heat pump and a filling station for the latest Tesla sounds nice, while one is not aware that the solar plant and probably the Tesla have been made in China, which, in the new world order, is no longer a friendly country.

China controls the vast majority of critical raw material flows for batteries and has cheaper energy than Europe. Without efficient waste recycling, Europe will pay a high price for its targeted green transition.",environmental issue

He also called for steps toward peace in Ukraine.","Organised by the Nova Gorica Association of WWII Veterans and the Primorska municipalities, the ceremony took place in Opatje Selo a day after Slovenia observed the Return of Primorska to the Motherland, a holiday commemorating the day in 1947 when the western region was reunited with the rest of the Slovenian nation after being under Italian rule since the end of WWI.

The Paris Peace Treaties, under which Italy had to give large parts of Primorska to Yugoslavia, ""repaid one of the major wrongs the Slovenian nation suffered throughout often unkind past,"" said Kučan.

But slowly, the memory is fading of ""overwhelming happiness and pride that were felt among Slovenians as the Paris Peace Treaties took effect,"" said Kučan, also recounting the sacrifices made by those fighting against Fascism.

Italy and Slovenia have gradually built model neighbourly relations, but there is something causing doubts in the honesty of the friendship: the attitude of Italian politicians toward Fascism, said Kučan.

The anti-Fascists killed in Basovizza are officially still terrorists in Italy, he said, adding that Slovenians are considered genocide perpetrators that supposedly killed Italians just because they were Italian.

Kučan also talked about the war in Ukraine, saying that there had so far been no significant efforts to stop the fighting.

He believes any step toward peace is better than the war continuing, and must not be understood as support for the aggressor. ""To be on the right side of history now means to be on the side of peace.""","unrest, conflicts and war"
Peer violence and permissive upbringing discussed at conference,"The increase in violence and aggressive behaviour among youth is partly a consequence of permissive upbringing that is present in every area of life, heard the Emergency Response and Awareness Conference, organised by the Slovenian branch of the International Police Organisation.","The modern society is not sufficiently aware of the aggressive behaviour of children and the youth, said Alma Mater Europaea associate professor Sebastjan Kristovič. The aggressive behaviour is on the rise not only in relationships with peers but also with parents and teachers, he said.

In the past, aggressive behaviour was mostly a result of an unstable situation at home, but today the cause is permissive upbringing or ""the broken education system from which we have eliminated discipline,"" Kristovič said.

The mental health of children is another topic that is often forgotten. In the last 25 years their mental health has worsened by 70%, Kristovič said. ""We give and buy children everything, but we cannot show them the meaning of life any more,"" he added.

The permissive upbringing along with excessive bureaucratisation have led to a professional and personal degradation of teachers. The profession has lost ""autonomy, authority and pedagogical dignity that is so highly appreciated in Scandinavian and other developed countries,"" Kristovič said.

The risk to become victims of peer violence is seventeen times larger for children with ADHD than those without, said Matic Novak from the University Psychiatric Clinic Ljubljana. Nearly half of children with ADHD were bullied in school and most have very few friends.

The two day conference on violence prevention and emergency response that took place on 19 and 20 April is a pilot project, aiming to become an annual event both at a regional and international level. Topics discussed at the event were peer violence, shootings, marauding terrorism and other mass casualty incidents. The honorary patron of the event, National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič addressed the attendees.",social issue
Slovenia considering moving troops from Slovakia to Romania,Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said Slovenia was considering moving its soldiers from Slovakia to Romania as he met his Romanian counterpart Angel Tilvar in Ljubljana on Thursday. The Slovenian army would also operate there as part of the multinational NATO battle group on the eastern flank of the alliance.,"With Slovenia being part of the southeastern operational area of NATO, Šarec expressed his wish to transfer members of the Slovenian Armed Forces from Slovakia to Romania in the second half of 2024. There are almost 130 Slovenian soldiers currently in Slovakia.

Slovenia's military has been present in Slovakia as part of NATO's Enhanced Vigilance Activities (eVA) operation since March 2022, and Šarec also noted the ongoing six-year presence of Slovenian soldiers in Latvia.

The Slovenian defence minister said Slovenia would like to move its troops to Romania, where an eVA battle group is operating under French command.

Šarec and Tilvar assessed that the Slovenian and Romanian armies cooperated well. Romania has participated in the NATO centre for mountain warfare in Slovenia's Poljče since 2018, while Slovenia will take part in the operation of the Euro-Atlantic Resilience Centre (E-ARC) in Bucharest.

The Slovenian minister noted that Romania had come to the rescue with two Alenia Spartan C-27J military transport aircraft during last year's fire in Kras, thanking Tilvar for the assistance on this occasion.

The countries also successfully participate in regional initiatives for the cooperation of defence ministries of Southeast Europe and for disaster preparedness and prevention for Southeast Europe, the Slovenian Defence Ministry said.

Ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Vilnius, the ministers agreed that concrete steps should be made to increase support for Ukraine, with ""upgrading of the comprehensive aid package into a well-thought-out long-term mechanism being of key importance,"" Šarec said.",sport

Ombudsman requests constitutional review of changed Financial Administration act,Human Rights Ombudsman Peter Svetina has decided to request a constitutional review of changes to the financial administration act that introduce the use of tracking devices to target illegal producers of products subject to excise duty. The coalition had announced the same move earlier today.,"Svetina said the contentious article of the changes that were passed in a re-vote on Tuesday after a veto from the upper chamber of parliament was the one introducing the tracking devices.

The changes stipulate that an approval by the head of the Financial Administration (FURS) suffices for the use of the tracking devices that use GPS to collect data on location and movement. ""This is an interference with privacy, which is a constitutionally guaranteed human right,"" Svetina said.

In line with the changes, the use of the tracking devices can only be ordered based on suspicion that the most serious tax offences have been committed, which the ombudsman thinks is a relatively low standard of proof.

He also noted that no judicial review was envisaged before the measure is used. Moreover, it is not clear how long such a measure can be in place, he said.

The changes were passed in mid-December, on support of only MPs from the senior coalition party Freedom Movement. The National Council vetoed the changes because of provisions on the tracking devices and in a re-vote the Freedom Movement was joined by the junior coalition Left to override the veto.

But the two parties agreed they themselves would ask for a constitutional review and the staying of the contentious tracking devices provision. Prime Minister Robert Golob said today all three coalition parties would request the review to show unity.

However, according to unofficial information, the junior coalition party Social Democrats (SD) seems to be reserved and was said to discuss the matter this afternoon.

Svetina noted that his office had been taking decisions on constitutional challenges independently. ""This is how we have acted so far and this is how we will continue to act,"" he said, adding that the law demanded this of his office. ""We take our decisions impartially and not on the basis of expectations or demands of individuals, but on the basis of professional arguments,"" he stressed.",politics

"CoE foundation of Europe, president says in address to Parliamentary Assembly","The Council of Europe (CoE) is the legal foundation of Europe, Slovenian President Nataša Pirc Musar said as she addressed the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday to mark the 30th anniversary of Slovenia's CoE membership. She expressed support for all efforts to reach a fair peace in Ukraine.","Europe must reject all fight back all attempts at clear violations of international law, said Pirc Musar.

The CoE must remain the global upholder of standards in new and emerging challenges in human rights, pointing to new technologies and AI, she said.

It is high time that their use is regulated in line with human rights because their effects can be devastating, said the president, calling on the CoE to seize the opportunity and create strong standards on ethical and responsible development of AI.

The CoE is an irreplaceable part of the general multilateral landscape and its legal regime is an important component of European stability, said Pirc Musar.

She underlined the need for complete implementation of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and stressed the importance of future cooperation between the CoE and the EU.

The president also talked about her vision for Slovenia's role in the CoE and affirmed the country's dedication to values, goals and standards of the CoE.

Being an advocate for CoE values, Slovenia plays an important role in the global community, she said, pointing to the recent election into the UN Security Council, where Slovenia will serve as a non-permanent member in 2024 and 2025.

During her two-day visit to Strasbourg, Pirc Musar met with CoE Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday, presenting her with Slovenia's ratification of the protocol on changes to the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.

Today, she met Parliamentary Assembly President Tiny Kox, ECHR President Siofra O'Leary and Slovenians who work at the court. She also visited a youth centre to discuss climate change.

This evening, Pirc Musar is attending a reception marking Slovenia's upcoming Statehood Day and Slovenia's 30 years in the CoE. Pirc Musar, Kox and Secretary General Deputy Björn Berge were scheduled to address the event.","crime, law and justice"
Farmer reps raise issue with changes to animal protection act,"The Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS) has labelled the coalition-sponsored changes to the Animal Protection Act as completely inappropriate, arguing that experts have not been consulted and that they bring rushed and potentially harmful solutions. It is most bothered by the idea to introduce authorised animal protection advisers.","The chamber said on Monday that the changes, put forward by the Freedom Movement, Social Democrats (SD) and the Left, ""have not been coordinated with experts, so they are ill-conceived and introduce rushed solutions ... that could cause more harm than good.""

What the KGZS finds the most disputable is the introduction of authorised animal protection advisers.

These would have to take a ""40-hour course, after which they should be able to assess the correctness of care of both farm animals and pets, and could even advise animal attendants. This is devaluation of the veterinary profession,"" it said.

The chamber noted that official veterinarians undergo training to perform these tasks for several years, including six years of studying.

The changes also allow authorised advisers to enter private property and collect evidence, which the KGZS deems a serious invasion of privacy.

""Considering that advisers will be trained quickly and the activist attitude of some animal protection associations, there is justified concern that the powers will often be exceeded and that the privacy of animal attendants will be encroached on.""

The chamber said that evidence collection is subject to precise rules and that appropriate training is required, as evidence could be excluded due to mistakes.

""An individual who is quickly trained is allowed to gather evidence that is later used together with their statements in official proceedings. These are excessive powers that also mean a violation of fundamental constitutional principles.""

It is unacceptable that someone with a 40-hour course will be above authorised persons, who will even have to explain themselves before them, said KGZS president Roman Žveglič, adding that the proposed changes ""legalise denunciation"".

The chamber has also raised the issue with the proposed obligation to microchip cats and complete ban on tethering dogs.

A farm is a specific area where cats, including stray cats, are traditionally present, and they cannot be controlled, so microchipping does not make sense in this case, it said, adding that this was also a considerable cost for farmers.

""The specifics of farms also need to be taken into account when it comes to tethering of dogs,"" the KGZS added, calling for clear criteria and conditions regarding the area in which dogs can freely move to be determined instead.

The chamber said that it was not clear whether video surveillance in abattoirs is mandatory or it is introduced at discretion of an inspector in specific proceedings. The provisions on transitional stables for seized animals are also ambiguous.

For this reason, it is not possible to estimate all potential costs and there is ""concern that authorised veterinarians would not be able to perform all tasks, which could affect the quality of food and health and safety of consumers.""",education
Fmr interior minister to become advisor to president,"President Nataša Pirc Musar is to appoint former Police Commissioner and Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar her advisor, the newspaper Delo reported Friday evening. The president told public broadcaster TV Slovenia that Bobnar would focus on human rights and safety.","""I can confirm that Tatjana Bobnar is coming to my office,"" Pirc Musar confirmed for TV Slovenija at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, after the news was reported by Delo. Nataša Dolenc remains her national security advisor, the president said.

She said that Bobnar would focus on what is known as the erasure, the deletion of some 26,000 Yugoslav nationals from the permanent residence registry in the early 1990s. Pirc Musar said this issue was a large black mark on Slovenia, adding that she wanted this resolved by the end of her five-year term.

Pirc Musar also said that Bobnar would focus on safety and domestic violence, the latter having been one of her priorities during her time as minister between June and December 2022.

Pirc Musar and Bobnar have cooperated in the past, when Pirc Musar was information commissioner and Bobnar the assistant police commissioner.

Bobnar was rumoured to become the president's advisor around the time of her resignation that followed a dispute between her and Prime Minister Robert Golob. However, these speculations were rejected by the team of Pirc Musar, who, at the time, was getting ready to be sworn in.

Delo noted yesterday that Pirc Musar's team allowed for the possibility that Bobnar may become an advisor later on. Meanwhile, the president has already informed the prime minister of her agreement with Bobnar, the paper also said.

However, the president's office has not yet responded to the STA's and Delo's queries as to when the formal appointment will be signed by Pirc Musar.",politics
Dnevnik critical of govt's mulling of new flag carrier,"The newspaper Dnevnik says in its commentary on Saturday that the same people who contributed to the downfall of Slovenia's flag carrier Adria Airways are now deciding whether Slovenia should establish a new airline. ""There is a plane-full of irony and sarcasm"" in the government's sudden focus on air connectivity.","It is absurd that air connectivity is being promoted by the same people who had ""invested a lot of effort in eroding air connectivity"", the paper says under the headline Roundtrip of an Adria.

Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek said on Friday that the government was looking into the possibility of establishing a new flag carrier. Bratušek and the entire cabinet are very supportive of the idea of an Air Slovenia, the paper says.

This is ironic, because it was Bratušek's government that decided the state should sell the flag carrier, which was a huge financial burden for the country, and a new carrier would not be financially feasible either.

Two years ago, the bad bank came up with numbers showing a carrier would only generate loss. A repeat solving of an already solved equation cannot give a different result. But Bratušek's team will likely come up with advantageous political arguments to spur the launch of a new carrier.

The financial side of the plan will be decided on by a different team: that of Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič, who served as Adria Airways crisis manager for two years in the early 2010s. He saved the company from bankruptcy in the short term by reducing labour cost and agreed a EUR 50 million state recapitalisation.

But the final blow came from the Civil Aviation Agency, which stripped the carrier of its flying licence. At the time, the agency was headed by Rok Marolt, now working in the general secretariat of the Finance Ministry. This spring he will get to help decide how much money the state could invest in a new carrier.

This story illustrates that, in practice, public interest is always a political variable strongly dependent on changing personal interests of the same public officials holding different positions at different times, the paper says.","economy, business and finance"

Only by respecting international law will we avoid a peace in pieces,"" Fajon stressed at the panel on the future and new paths for an effective UN, the Foreign Ministry said.

The panel Peace in Pieces was co-hosted by the Bled Strategic Forum and the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) of India, the organiser of the Raisina Dialogue, India's main annual international conference on foreign policy issues.

Speaking at the panel on solutions for an increasingly divided world together with the foreign ministers of South Africa and Sri Lanka, Fajon paid particular attention to young people, especially women and girls. She pointed to the huge gender gap, warning that ""by some estimates, it will take us about 130 years to truly empower half the world's population.""

Aid campaigns for Turkey in full swing in Slovenia,"The city of Celje will be collecting aid for its earthquake-stricken Turkish twin city Gaziantep this week, while the Turkish Embassy in Ljubljana has for now collected enough clothes and food but is still collecting heaters, sleeping mats and tents.","The items that Gaziantep residents need most are winter clothes, food, hygiene products, blankets, tents, cookers and other necessities.

The goods will be collected between Tuesday and Thursday between 2 and 6pm at the public company Zelenice, the city of Celje said on Monday.

A convoy with the humanitarian aid will leave for Gaziantep, the city near the epicentre of last week's devastating quake, at the end of the week.

The embassy meanwhile told the STA the campaign to collect aid for Turkey that started last Tuesday had an incredible response.

A tonne and a half of aid, including sanitary products, heaters and tents, has already been shipped off, with the next shipment planned to leave by the end of the week.

Due to the overwhelming response, the embassy is currently no longer collecting clothes and food as it has to first deliver what has already been collected, which is a huge logistical effort.

Many Slovenian charities, such as the Red Cross, UNICEF Slovenia and Slovenian Caritas, have joined the embassy's campaign alongside many volunteers, while the Islamic Community in Slovenia has helped spread the word about it, the embassy told the STA.

Paper worried about shortage of staff at care homes,"The system of social care has found itself in a bad situation after years of neglect, the newspaper Primorske Novice says in Wednesday's commentary Who Will Look after the Elderly?.","It says that two figures show very well what the situation is - around 750 beds are unoccupied at care homes across the country due to a shortage of staff, especially nurses, while at the same time around 17,000 elderly people are waiting to get a bed.

But the situation goes beyond beds as an entire newly-built care home with over 60 beds in the town of Pivka has been unable to open since spring due to the shortage of staff.

The Austrian investor SeneCure is definitely unhappy, having entered the Slovenian market with big plans while making no money now. The municipality is also in an awkward situation, having struggled for years to bring care closer to its residents.

The now largely forgotten Covid epidemic has brought to the surface the consequences of years of neglect in the field of care for the elderly, as well as serious staffing and financial problems and space constraints.

Care homes without people are a bitter reminder that investment in new homes and in new long-term care services brings no benefits if there is no investment in staff.

Overwork, low pay, outdated standards and undervalued work drive care staff out of the social care system and will not attract foreign workers. ""We are in fact on the brink of a catastrophe, and those in charge are not responding fast enough.""",social issue
Small businesses critical of compulsory solidarity contribution for flood relief,The Chamber of Craft and Small Business (OZS) was critical on Tuesday of the compulsory relief contributions individuals and companies will have to pay as envisaged in the emergency flood relief bill.,"The OZS said that ""solidarity must not and cannot be mandatory"" and called for the contributions scheme to be laid out in detail only after the damage is fully assessed.

The OZS's management board expresses opposition to the plan, adopted last Thursday by the government, to have companies contribute 0.8% of pre-tax profit and individuals 0.3% of income tax to a special post-flood reconstruction fund that is being established.

Solidarity must not and cannot be mandatory, the board members argued, saying this also applied to the envisaged alternative contribution by way of forfeited earnings from two ""solidarity Saturdays"" worked.

""The moment solidarity becomes compulsory, we are talking about a new levy,"" OZS president Blaž Cvar said, according to a press release by the chamber.

The board, which praised the fast response of the authorities to the recent devastating floods, moreover feels that full pay compensation, like had been the case during the Covid-19 epidemic, instead of only 80% should be secured by the state to those furloughed due to the floods.

The OZS, which also argued no exact contribution figures can be discussed until the assessment of the damage is finalised, would moreover like to see companies that were flooded excluded from the solidarity contribution scheme.

Also, all affected companies should be entitled to aid, irrespective of how much their income has suffered.

The chamber also praised some of the proposals in the bill, including the planned increase in the number of hours of temporary and casual work for pensioners, and faster recruitment of foreigners for professions and activities needed to deal with the consequences of floods and landslides.",labour

While the acquirer has not revealed the price of the deal, the business newspaper Finance reports it stands at EUR 93 million.","RHI Magnesita, which last year generated EUR 3.3 billion in revenue and EUR 167 million in net profit at the group level, is buying Seven Refractories business in the parent factory in Divača and in factories in India and the US.

The sales offices and service centres in Cyprus, Germany, Italy and the UK are also part of the deal to acquire one of the leading producers of refractory concrete and plugs for blast furnaces.

Announcing the deal, the acquirer said on Monday that it complemented its product portfolio and opened up new opportunities in the development of production technologies with a low carbon footprint.

The acquisition by RHI Magnesita, which has 33 production units and more than 70 points of sale worldwide, is expected to be completed in the second half of the year, pending approval of relevant regulatory bodies.

Erik Zobec, the chief executive officer and co-owner of Seven Refractories, has told Finance that the sale had been done so that the company could grow even further.

""We see a lot of potential for growth with RHI Magnesita. They have a very large marketing network, and we see many opportunities especially in the Asian market, but also in India and the US,"" he added.

Seven Refractories, which launched its operations in Divača in 2011, last year generated EUR 105 million in revenue and EUR 11.4 million in pre-tax profit with its 240 employees at the group level.

Top court upholds inadmissibility of marriage equality referendum,The Constitutional Court has upheld the decision of the National Assembly to declare a referendum on changes to the family code that allow gay marriages and adoptions inadmissible after reviewing an appeal by the conservative Children Are at Stake Coalition.,"In the decision announced on Wednesday, the country's top court noted that it had found in its two previous decisions the family code to be unconstitutional.

By passing the challenged changes, the National Assembly had only followed the findings of the Constitutional Court, which is why the changes belong to the exceptions on which a referendum is not admissible, it added.

Parliament last October declared as inadmissible a referendum motion targeting the changes to the family code that introduce marriage equality and end the discrimination of LGBT+ persons when it comes to marriage and adoptions.

The motion was dismissed with the votes of the coalition based on a provision of the constitution which states that laws which rectify legislative provisions deemed by the Constitutional Court as unconstitutional cannot be put to a referendum.

An appeal against this decision was submitted last November by Aleš Primc and Metka Zevnik, the co-leaders of the Children Are at Stake Coalition that has been campaigning against marriage equality for years.

The Constitutional Court said in its latest decision that, while the constitution provides for the possibility of a legislative referendum, there are cases when this is inadmissible.

The latter applies to referendums on laws that eliminate unconstitutionality in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms or other unconstitutionality, it added.

In these cases, it is not possible to talk about the right to ask for a referendum at all, and the court only has to assess whether the relevant article of the constitution can be applied, the court said.

It noted its previous two decisions that found the legal regulation stipulating that only two persons of different genders can get married and that same-sex partners living in a formal partnership cannot adopt a child is inconsistent with the constitutional prohibition of discrimination.

The court thus said that the changes to the family code eliminated the unconstitutionality established with these two decisions.

What is more, it sided with the National Assembly in the opinion that the definition of marriage that consequently affects the definition of potential beneficiaries of joint adoption literally follows the manner of implementation provided in the relevant Constitutional Court decision.

The court dismissed the arguments of the appellants that the changes do not only eliminate unconstitutionalities because the change of the definition of marriage could indirectly affect all areas of law where the legislature ties certain legal consequences to the institution of marriage.

""It cannot be expected from the Constitutional Court to itself look for laws and their individual provisions ... which could be affected by the new definition of marriage,"" it said.

Even if the definition of marriage causes legal consequences in other areas of law, this does not mean that the changes to the family code do not fall under the exception provided for in Article 90 of the Constitution, the court added.

Taking this into account, it did not assess the arguments of the appellants regarding the possible unconstitutionality of the changes, saying that these could be subjected to a constitutional review once they entered into force.

The Constitutional Court also noted the well-established concept of constitutional democracy, the essence of which is that the values protected by the constitution, including human rights and fundamental freedoms, can override democratically accepted decisions of the majority.

The decision was made by seven votes to one, with judge Rok Svetlič providing a dissenting opinion and judge Marko Šorli a concurring opinion.","crime, law and justice"
Večer thinks jet fiasco bad for the government,"The newspaper Večer shows disapproval of National Assembly Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič flying to Vienna with the government jet instead of taking a car. In the light of climate change and recession, Večer calls for politicians to lead by a modest example.","Klakočar Zupančič is the vice-president of the leading party, the Freedom Movement, which is committed to a green transition and reducing harmful emissions. ""Can the commitments of the largest government party even be honest if they are not respected by one of its most prominent members?"" wonders Večer in a commentary titled Modesty and Humility.

""Golob's government is planning many reforms for the coming year that will require public support. How will they convince the people that radical social changes, even the green transition, are necessary, if some politicians just brush them aside?""

If Klakočar Zupančič though she could calm the public by saying that ""all was legal"" concerning the flight, she was wrong, writes Večer, adding that she has instead shown her indifference to efforts to reduce the carbon footprint.

Although the public counts on politicians spending taxpayer money prudently, there have been several similar fiascos in the past. The jet has been used for short flights to Vienna and Milan, even flying empty from Ljubljana to Maribor and Trieste to pick up Borut Pahor, president at the time.

""Nobody expects that the country's leaders will ride in carriages and travel without a carbon footprint. We do expect them to lead by example and not use jets ... for short distances. And that in times of an energy and food crisis with a new recession in sight, we expect they will serve the country with modesty and humility.""",politics
Survey shows online pornography accessed by pre-teen children,"Internet pornography is easily accessible to all internet users and a survey conducted by Safe.si, an internet safety awareness project, has revealed that 44% of primary school children and 62% of secondary school children have already viewed pornography online. One in three teenagers encountered online pornography between the ages of 9 and 11.","Nearly half of the teenagers (46%) who have encountered online pornography did so between the ages 12 and 14. 8% came across it between the ages of six and nine, while 6% were exposed to it before the age of six. Early exposure to such content negatively affects children's understanding of sexuality and can lead to issues in future relationships and first sexual encounters, Safe.si wrote.

The first contact with pornography evoked curiosity in most teenagers. However, they also experienced negative emotions, with 25% of primary school children and 39% of secondary school children feeling confused, and 34% of primary school children and 19% of secondary school children feeling uncomfortable.

Children primarily use phones (89% of primary school children and 97% of secondary school children) to access online pornography, mostly viewing it alone (91%). Some also view it with friends (25% of primary school children and 19% of secondary school children) or with their partners (10% of primary school children and 16% of secondary school children). Less than 10% view it with siblings.

One out of five primary school children and one out of four secondary school children view pornography frequently, while one fifth of primary school children and one third of secondary school children view it occasionally. Among those who view pornography frequently or occasionally, 60% do so several times a week, and 25% do it once a week.

10% of primary school children and 15% of secondary school children who view pornography feel addicted to it. 14% of secondary school children stated that they need increasingly extreme content to satisfy themselves. 14% of primary school children and 8% of secondary school children have negative feelings about sexuality (fear, repulsion, etc.).

Almost half of the primary school children and two fifths of secondary school children who have encountered online pornography have seen content featuring violent forms of sexuality.

One third of all surveyed children aged 12 to 15, and half of those aged 15 to 19 have been recipients of sexually explicit images or videos.

Among these, 80% of primary school children and 60% of secondary school children did not want to receive such content. 5% of primary school children and 14% of secondary school children have sent nude or explicit images of themselves to someone. With 43% of primary school children and 23% of secondary school children, these images were shared further without their consent.

While 58% of primary school children and 45% of secondary school children agree that online pornography is accessible too easily, 70% of primary school children and 62% of secondary school children believe that it can harm children and teenagers. One fifth of primary school children and one quarter of secondary school children believe that they can learn about sexuality from pornography.

Almost half of primary school children (47%) and 42% of secondary school children agree that pornography objectifies women and encourages hatred and violence towards them. However, 28% of primary school children and 35% of secondary school children disagree.

Only a third of children have ever discussed sexuality with their parents, and only 11% of primary school children and 16% of secondary school children have discussed pornography at home.

One third of primary school children and two fifths of secondary school children believe that sexuality and pornography are not discussed enough at school. 21% of primary school children and 16% of secondary school children use pornography as a means to learn about sexuality.

The survey was conducted by Safe.si, which operates as part of the Ljubljana Faculty of Social Sciences. It was carried out between February and April 2023 as part of the activities for Safer Internet Day. A total of 566 primary school children aged 12 to 15 and 453 secondary school children aged 15 to 19 participated.",education
Golob notes goal of value added wood products,"The wood-processing industry in Slovenia has been in a state of crisis for some time now, Prime Minister Robert Golob said in parliament on Tuesday in response to an MP's question. The primary goal should be to manufacture products with higher value added, he noted.","To supply wood-processing companies, the state-owned forestry company SiDG has at its disposal some 700,000 cubic metres of forest and wood products per year, said Social Democrats (SD) MP Predrag Baković as he quizzed the prime minister about the matter.

Supply contracts ended at the end of last year and most companies are not happy with the SiDG's new open calls since they are to get less than in recent years, he added.

Moreover, in what was a new development, Croatian companies were also allowed to take part in the open calls under the new rules that were changed by the previous government. On the other hand, Slovenian companies cannot do the same in Croatia unless they are headquartered there, Baković said.

He wondered whether the government will reverse the changes to ban the sale of Slovenian wood to Croatian companies.

Golob said they would look into this, but noted that even if such open calls did not include any foreign buyers, that would not change the fact that some Slovenian companies did not meet the relevant criteria. ""And this part is more important than merely establishing who is the buyer.""

He stressed the importance of focusing on the areas where Slovenian wood will be marketed as a strategic asset.

During today's questions time, Golob was also quizzed by opposition MPs about the escalating situation regarding the public sector pay system.

He reiterated that the system did not work because of piecemeal agreements that had been adopted under previous governments. He announced that the planned reform would include salary increases for elected officials, but starting from their next term.","economy, business and finance"
Foreign minister starts two-day visit to Tanzania,Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon is starting a two-day visit to Tanzania where she will meet her Tanzanian counterpart Stergomena Lawrence Tax to strengthen political and economic cooperation between the countries. Fajon will present Slovenia's candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council.,"New opportunities for cooperation between the countries will be formed as part of the visit, particularly in the fields of energy, technology, water management, green economy and food security, the ministry wrote.

Fajon will present to the Tanzanian minister the international conference Africa Day, hosted by Slovenia every year, that will take place in April and focus on food security.

Fajon has just finished a three-day visit to Ethiopia garnering support for Slovenia's candidacy for the Security Council and strengthening cooperation.

The support of African countries will be key in Slovenia's bid for a seat in the Security Council, so senior officials are travelling to Africa to get endorsement. Last week State Secretary Samuel Žbogar visited Namibia and Botswana and National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič visited Rwanda and Uganda.

The elections will take place on 6 June. Competing against Belarus, Slovenia needs 129 votes to be elected. Fajon is staying moderately optimistic, she said some days ago in Brussels.","economy, business and finance"
WWII bomb successfully deactivated in Nova Gorica,A 250kg aerial bomb from WWII with around 100kg of explosive was successfully deactivated as bomb technicians removed the fuses on Sunday morning. What is believed to be a British bomb was discovered during construction works at the train station in the western city of Nova Gorica on the border with Italy on Monday.,"Nearby residents on both sides of the border were evacuated, starting at 7am, before the deactivation effort started at 10am.

The bomb was discovered when an excavator hit it during the construction works slightly damaging it, but it luckily did not explode.

Slovenia joins condemnation of Jerusalem attacks,Prime Minister Robert Golob and the Slovenian Foreign Ministry have condemned the deadly shooting at a synagogue in East Jerusalem on Friday and the attack that followed on Saturday.,"""Violence must be avoided at all costs. My thoughts are with the families and relatives of the victims,"" Golob said on the government's Twitter profile.

Condemning the ""horrific terrorist attack"" at the synagogue in Jerusalem, the Foreign Ministry called ""on all parties to refrain from actions which would lead to further violence"".

Seven people were killed and at least three more were injured in the shooting at the synagogue on Friday, which coincided with Holocaust Remembrance Day. Two people were also injured on Saturday in a separate attack outside the Old City.

The shootings followed after nine Palestinians were killed during an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Thursday.","crime, law and justice"
IJS nanotech researchers working on precise cancer drug delivery system,"A group of researchers at Slovenia's foremost research centre, the Jožef Stefan Institute (IJS), is developing a cancer treatment delivery system using red blood cells, which they hope will provide a much more targetted approach than the still widely used radiation and chemotherapy, which can be very detrimental to healthy tissue.","Led by Nina Kostevšek, the researchers are isolating red blood cells, subjecting them to osmotic shock and extracting haemoglobin through the membrane pores. Once haemoglobin, which takes up most of the cell's volume, is removed, there is space for an active ingredient.

The substance is inserted through membrane pores, after which the cells are placed in a blood-like environment that allows the pores to close. The cells are then injected back into the body, which recognises them as erythrocytes, even though their contents are completely different, a veritable Trojan horse making its way to its target.

There are a number of challenges in cancer treatment drug targetting. ""The first obstacle comes up immediately after a drug is injected, as a variety of proteins and immune cells in the blood stream recognise the substance as a foreign body and remove it from the body,"" Kostevšek illustrated.

Therefore, the active substances must be ""packaged"" so that the immune system does not reject them, and ensure that they stay in the blood stream long enough to reach the target tissue. Moreover, the nanocarriers must survive the complex environment within the tumour and release the active substance in the right place.

Kostevšek is focusing on red blood cells, because synthetic nanotech delivery systems cause an immune response in patients. She believes this will not be the case with red blood cells. ""All erythrocytes carry certain markers that tell the immune cells that they must not be removed.""

Moreover, red blood cells are very easy to isolate, but most important of all, they do not have a nucleus and a DNA, so there is no fear of transmitting the genetic material to another person, Kostevšek told the STA.",health
A 4.0 earthquake shakes Slovenia-Croatia border area,The Environment Agency's seismographs picked up a 4.0-magnitude earthquake at 7:34pm on Saturday nine kilometres east of the village of Jelšane near the Slovenian border with Croatia.

Football celebrities raising funds for flood-stricken Slovenians (adds),"Two teams of former football stars will play a charity match at Stožice Stadium in Ljubljana this evening to raise funds for Slovenians who were severely affected by floods in early August. The captain of the blue team will be the Italian Paolo Maldini, while the Portuguese Luis Figo will head the red team.","The football fund-raiser, which sold out very quickly, is organised by UEFA upon the initiative of its president Aleksander Čeferin, a Slovenian, after UEFA donated EUR 300,000 just days after the floods hit.

Speaking at a news conference in Ljubljana before the match, Čeferin said: ""When I saw what happened in Slovenia, we had this idea for a charity match. I'm very happy that my friends, the football legends, have responded.""

As many as 36 footballers are on the list, while the referee will be Italian Roberto Rosetti, who is now head of UEFA referees.

Among those who responded to UEFA's call are also Gianluigi Buffon, Andriy Shevchenko, Zvonimir Boban, Javier Zanetti, Eric Abidal, Predrag Mijatović, Vladimir Šmicer, Nemanja Vidić, David James, Giorgos Karagounis, Mario Mandžukić, Mikael Silvestre, Fabio Capello, Miroslav Klose, Clarence Seedorf, Robert Pires, Dimitar Berbatov, Hamit Altintop, Levan Kobiashvili and Vedran Ćorluka.

More than 16,000 visitors are expected at Stožice Stadium, with Čeferin saying he was surprised at how fast the match sold out. He, however, declined to reveal how much funds has been raised, saying this would be made known after the match.

All funds raised at the charity, dubbed Football Stars for Flood Victims, will be donated to the foundation Preprosto Blizu (Simply Close).

Čeferin reiterated the power of football to unite: ""As I've said many times before, football is more than sport. Football is part of our culture, it unites, so I expect a very positive atmosphere at today's match.""

The captains of both teams said they were happy to be here and to be able to help Slovenians who were affected by the floods.

Both also jokingly said they feel some pressure. Maldini, the captain of the blue team, said he last played seven years ago. Figo added that ""the most important thing is not to get injured"".

Maldini's father Cesare was born in Trieste, just across the border from Slovenia, to parents of Slovenian descent. Maldini said he was not aware of where exactly his roots are, but that he feels close to the neighbours.

The teams will play two 30-minute halves, with several Slovenian pop singers and bands performing during the break.",sport
Valentina Prevolnik Rupel appointed new health minister,"Valentina Prevolnik Rupel, a state secretary at the Health Ministry, was appointed health minister in a 48:17 vote on Friday. She is replacing Danijel Bešič Loredan, whom PM Robert Golob asked to resign in early July over different views on how to reform the country's public healthcare. Rupel has already been sworn in.","Rupel stressed better access to healthcare, high-quality services, a reform of the basket of services, and patients who don't have a named GP as her priorities during her hearing on the parliamentary Health Committee, which endorsed her candidacy on Tuesday.

Presenting his pick to MPs, Golob said today that Rupel had the best insight into the challenges of healthcare, which made her the best choice for the job.

She enjoys the support of all healthcare stakeholders, which is a clear sign that she is the one who can give the most efficient solutions to the challenges ahead.

Golob also pointed out that in 2008 she earned a PhD in healthcare quality and financing, while she has served as Health Ministry state secretary for the past three months, working closely with Golob, who stepped in as health minister.

She enjoys Golob's political and personal support. Golob is confident that she will manage to cut wait times and enable access to a GP to more patients, while her main task will be to introduce quality of health services into the way they are financed.

The MPs of all three coalition parties hailed Rupel's competences, but stressed that she must immediately continue the work that has been started and be efficient.

Bojana Muršič of the Social Democrats (SD) said that Rupel's priorities were consistent with the goals of the coalition agreement.

Since people want an accessible, high-quality and public healthcare system, while time is running out, ""the work must continue with a lot of efficiency"".

Muršič believes that Rupel not being a medical doctor is by no means an obstacle but an advantage as she knows the system well.

The Left expects the new minister to be foremost the bulwark of public healthcare and to be aware that the market logic must be driven out of Slovenia's healthcare.

As for Rupel's plans to overhaul the basket of services, MP Matej Tašner Vatovec said the Left understood this not as reducing them, but as introducing more order.

The minister will also have to stop a number of lobbies, including those of doctors, insurers and all the other private interests, he said.

Muršič and Vatovec urged changing the manner in which the public health fund ZZZS is funded as a prerequisite to achieve the set goals.

The SD welcomed Rupel's view to merge the current mandatory and voluntary health insurance contributions and suitably adjust the contribution rate to secure enough funds, while Vatovec said that new sources of funds should also be considered.

The two opposition parties, on the other hand, said they would not vote for the candidate, with the Democrats (SDS) saying that healthcare reform was not Rupel's goal, while New Slovenia (NSi) said that health policy did not depend on the minister alone, but on the entire coalition.

SDS MP Karmen Furman indicated that the government coalition had obviously dropped the health reform, as it had not implemented any of the announced legislative changes yet. ""There is clearly no more health reform in this coalition, so the main question here is whether the minister has a goal.""

Furman also complained Rupel outlined the situation in healthcare to the Health Committee but presented no solutions, including no solution to regulate psychotherapy.

Given her credentials, the SDS is surprised Rupel mentioned the basket of services as a priority while she was unable to say how she will define the basket.

NSi MP Iva Dimic said the new minister would have to act fast to tackle issues such as a shortage of staff, staff leaving abroad, staled investment, problems with the congenital heart disease department, management of medical organisations, dental care, orthodontics, digitalisation and mental health.

The NSi also expect her to tackle psychotherapy and waiting times, said Dimic, noting that despite a number of measures, waiting times have not been shortened.",health
NGOs say govt not adhering to Paris goals in updating Energy and Climate Plan,"More than 60 environmental NGOs associated in Plan B for Slovenia and the Network for Space claim that Slovenia's plans to update the National Energy and Climate Plan do not take into account the binding goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, to which the country has committed. They say it is high time for more ambitious goals and measures.","Efforts to update the national plan should be guided by the recently published 6th report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the NGOs said on Wednesday.

The report says that based on the Paris Climate Agreement, the binding goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius can still be reached.

Aljoša Petek, legal expert at the Legal Centre for the Protection of Human Rights and Environment, thus accused Slovenia of ""deliberately not pursuing the legally binding objectives of the Paris Agreement to which it has committed"" in a press release.

""We advocate Slovenia's climate neutrality by 2040. We believe that it is possible to achieve more ambitious goals by 2030, but only if energy use is significantly lower and more efficient and if more energy is produced from renewable sources of energy, foremost solar and wind,"" the NGOs says.

They propose a scenario to raise the share of renewables to 100% without building new large hydro power stations.

They want to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65% by 2030 and have Natura 2000 areas fully excluded from renewables installations.

Another proposal is that the national plan should support community energy projects such as community solar installations.

Dependency on cars should be reduced by developing sustainable mobility infrastructure with a special focus on immediately strengthening public transport.

Another priority should be eliminating energy and mobility poverty, where the NGOs believe the national plan should bring measures to reduce social inequalities.

Ajda Cafun from Umanotera said the scenario for the update is problematic in two respects - it sets much too low goals for reducing energy use, while it neglects just transition measures and increases social inequality.

""The updated plan should include measures to shift to energy efficiency and renewable energy for low-income households, and substantial funds for this purpose should be raised from the biggest polluters,"" she said.

The government launched a public consultation period on its update plans on 6 April and solicited proposals until 3 May. The final proposed update is scheduled to be unveiled by next spring while EU member states must submit their updated plans to the European Commission by July 2024.",environmental issue

Finance says green transition is costly but inevitable,"The transition from energy-wasting and environmentally burdensome technologies to green technologies is not simple or cheap but there seem to be no other alternative at the moment, the newspaper Finance says in Monday's commentary Race into the Green at Different Speeds.","Subsidies encouraging companies to invest into sustainable and circular practices are all part of a broader goal of the EU's green transition. The war in Ukraine has further exposed the EU's vulnerability when it comes to energy, so now the bloc has, at least on paper, sped up its efforts to get rid of its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

So currently, a combination of measures is being put in place to enable a green transition and energy independence from Russia and member states are trying to catch up in this expensive yet inevitable race the best they can.

For Slovenia the EU's latest proposal of rising the share of renewables in total energy consumption to at least 45% until 2030 is beyond reach, as the country is behind even in meeting the initial goal of having 25% of renewable energy.

It is expected that by 2030 the goal for Slovenia will be set at 35-45%, while currently it is at 27%. If a country does not meet the goal it must buy the missing share from other countries and this is expected to cost Slovenia EUR 80 million until 2026.

""Being late will cost us dearly ... and business too will have to pay dearly, as legislation is becoming stricter and partners in chains will be searching for those with green certificates; loans will get costlier as will the energy and raw materials.""

Slovenska Bistrica council opposes wind farms on Pohorje,The local council of Slovenska Bistrica urged on Wednesday the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning to stop the procedure to issue a building permit for 35 wind turbines that the company Energija na Veter is planning to set up at two locations on Pohorje hills in the north-east of the country.,"The council discussed the municipality's opinion that the documents submitted for the building permit are not in line with municipal rules or the national legislation.

This is after the council alerted the investor in June that only small wind turbines with a rated capacity of one megawatt could be built in agricultural areas.

The council believes that such a big project does not belong to Pohorje.

Energija na Veter, which is indirectly owned by the Swiss company Woc Group, plans to build 56 wind turbines on Pohorje - 21 in Trije Kralji, 14 in Frajhajm near Areh and 21 in Kot.

Opposition to the wind farm in Trije Kralji was expressed by the residents of the local community of Tinje earlier this month.

Maksimiljan Tramšek, head of this local community, accused the investor at yesterday's council session of having kept the project secret while walking around Pohorje for five years preparing the documents.

Drago Mahorko, head of the civil initiative Wind Farm-Free Pohorje, highlighted risks to the environment saying that Pohorje being degraded would be an end to green tourism.

Jana Habjan, a representative of the investor, tried to convince the council that the civil initiative had painted a one-sided picture, so she presented some advantages while pointing out their commitment to keep the protected areas intact.

""Repeating that there is no wind on Pohorje, that there will be no more clean water and no more forest, without anyone presenting the real facts, not only causes great harm to the residents and the municipality, but creates a completely unnecessary atmosphere with which the civil initiative divides people and hampers development.""

She said that wind on Pohorje is excellent for the wind farms to work well, that all wind turbines have safety guards to ensure clean water, and that a new tree will be planted for every one that is cut down.

Habjan said the project brings a number of opportunities, such as cheaper electricity for residents of the municipality, improvements to roads, forest roads and the power network, as well as an annual contribution estimated at EUR 2.7 million to the municipal budget.

To further reach out to residents in Kebelj, Šmartno na Pohorju and Tinje, the three towns closest to the planned wind farms, Energija na Veter now also decided to provide free electricity to the households that are located closest to the turbines for the entire lifespan of the wind farms, said Habjan.",environmental issue
Reporter says Kučan the political winner of 2022,"The biggest political winner of 2022 is Slovenia's first President Milan Kučan, as both the country's president and prime minister had been backed by him before the election, the newspaper Reporter says in its latest editorial. The biggest loser of 2022 is the head of the opposition Democrats (SDS), Janez Janša.","""Milan Kučan and Janez Janša are eternal. Many others leave, they stay. The game of thrones in the house of the dragon has been going on for more than thirty years.""

Kučan ended his presidential term before Christmas of 2002, but two decades later his candidate Nataša Pirc Musar became president and Robert Golob, whom Kučan backed before the election, is the prime minister.

At 82 and 64, Kučan and Janša, respectively, continue to profoundly despise each other and divide Slovenians with their hatred. They are like a two-headed dragon that feeds itself and keeps itself politically alive. Both are among the top ten most influential Slovenians.

Kučan's informal influence is far greater than that of the prime minister and he acts like it too, so it is no secret that the two do not like each other very much.

Kučan is like the lord of the rings while new political faces are dispensable. No more than a hint from him is needed on who should be the next president or prime minister and left-leaning voters vote for that person.

""When it gets too hot in his political kitchen, when his political children fight amongst each other too much, he reduces the temperature quickly, but despite his great informal influence he does not always succeed in putting out the fire. Then Janša comes to power. Briefly, for a year or two, until the left is consolidated again.""

In the autumn of their lives, all that Kučan and Janša care about is glory and honours. They are competing in who will get the bigger monument, whose name will be written in the history books, and who will be called a statesman.

They live in a kind of parallel world, a virtual reality that never ends where it is all about money and power. Little do they care about the citizens, except for a few months before the election, Reporter says under the headline House of the Dragon.",politics
Dnevnik lambastes Golob and Janković,"Dnevnik is critical of Prime Minister Robert Golob and Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković in Wednesday's commentary in light of the chambermaids' strike over Sava Turizem transferring them to another company, and the Ljubljana Community Health Centre's director getting a bonus. It says both politicians have lost their moral compass.","Commenting on Tuesday's token strike of chambermaids at state-owned hotel chain Hoteli Bernardin, who are dissatisfied with hotel chain owner Sava Turizem transferring them to another company only to then outsource them, Dnevnik says the government green-lighted this despite its coalition partner the Left, advocating for years for outsourcing to be eradicated.

But Golob did not think twice to ignore his pre-election promises, even though ministers who come form the Left are opposed to outsourcing, because it is Golob who is holding the reins, Dnevnik says under the headline Moral Principles of Golob and Janković.

The Ljubljana City council confirming a performance bonus for the head of the Ljubljana Community Health Centre Antonija Poplas Susič resulted in a public outcry due to utter healthcare chaos in the capital.

Nevertheless, the director enjoys Jankovič's full support and he is stubbornly defending her, saying she is a good director and he himself a good politician.

""A good politician should know when to do the decent thing and take a step back. And a good director should also know when they have to waive her bonus,"" Dnevnik says.

Janković can be stubborn on this as he is backed by the Freedom Movement's city councillors. When they signed the coalition agreement with the mayor, many said they were signing a deal with the devil, the commentary recalls. But they did it to keep the alliance between Golob and Janković.

Dnevnik says it was only a matter of time when the Freedom Movement's city councillors would vote against what their party is advocating at the government level.

At the same time that Janković was praising the city coalition's ""courage"", the Freedom Movement's PR service released a statement saying that their party has in no way ""succumbed to the Ljubljana Mayor's dictate."" Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan was eager to say he will not okay the performance bonus.

""Truth be told, all of this is just a political bluff,"" the newspaper writes, adding that the Freedom Movement has renounced its moral standards when they signed the city coalition agreement.

""Morals, ethics and values have never been a forte for Slovenian political parties and politicians. So why expect any different from the current state and city bosses,"" Dnevnik concludes.",politics
Industrial output down in February,"Industrial output in Slovenia was down by 3.7% in February compared to January. The largest drop was recorded in electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply, where output declined by 21.3%. Industrial output increased only in capital goods, where it grew by 3%, the Statistics Office reported on Tuesday.","Industrial output dropped by 3.5% in mining and quarrying and by 2.3% in manufacturing. It decreased by 1.4% in intermediate goods and by 0.6% in consumer goods.

Pirc Musar and Fajon happy with Slovenia's UN Security Council campaign,"On the margins of the UN Water Conference in New York, President Nataša Pirc Musar and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said that Slovenia's bid for non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council in 2024 and 2025 was going very well. They are both optimistic about the country's chances of success in the June election.","Slovenia's only rival for the non-permanent seat allotted to the Eastern European Group in the UN system is Belarus.

The latter country is not leading a special campaign ahead of the election, and Fajon has not noticed any such campaign being led by Russia or China on behalf of Belarus.

""Slovenia has good relations with China. Our state secretary recently returned from a visit to China with very positive impressions,"" she told Slovenian correspondents in the US on Thursday, saying that Slovenia had not been lobbying Russia to promote its bid.

Pirc Musar told the reporters: ""We're doing very well. My added value is that I can approach most senior politicians, and I'm more than happy to help even if it is a government project. But the president should be aware that foreign policy is an area where the government, the National Assembly and the president should act in a coordinated way.""

Climate change is in focus of talks on Slovenia's bid with officials at the UN conference, Fajon and Pirc Musar said. The president told the correspondents that other countries recognised that Slovenia was willing to work hard on this issue and believed in green policies.

Slovenia has done a lot in protecting the right to clean drinking water, and it is considered a country that is active in green efforts and protection of human rights, Fajon said.

There lie some common interests, the minister added, interest in starting new partnerships, including in the area of security, peace and women issues. ""In this circle, women connect quickly and conversations are usually very pleasant.""

Fajon would not dare to predict the outcome of the election, but she has a good feeling about this and hopes that Slovenia succeeds in the first round of the election. The country has to win at least 129 votes in the 193-strong UN General Assembly to be elected a non-permanent member of the Security Council.

When it comes to the war in Ukraine, practically all the officials Slovenian representatives have talked to have been underlining the need for peace and the importance of the rule of law, the minister said.

Some officials from African countries see Slovenia as an unencumbered country, a belief that goes as far back as the times of the former Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement. This means a lot to them and they consider Slovenia a country able to defend different interests and, at the same time, the interests of small countries, of which there are more than 100 in the UN, Fajon said.

Asked how the war in Ukraine has impacted Slovenia's lobbying, Pirc Musar gave a ""brutally honest"" reply. She recalled the Iraq war, a topic she discussed with the Iraqi president on Wednesday. That war started even though Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.

""These countries very much resent our different position on the war in Ukraine,"" the president said. ""I have advocated and will always advocate that the Charter of the United Nations be respected in its entirety and without exception for all states,"" she said.

EU countries still thankfully share a united front regarding the Ukraine war, but countries in other parts of the world understand the war less and only feel its effects through higher food and energy prices.

""In Slovenia, too, there are more and more debates that the EU is perhaps not doing enough for peace. My answer is very simple. If any of those who say this know how to achieve peace, I will be happy to work on that agenda. There is not a country in the EU that is not for peace.

""But as long as both presidents - Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin - are stubborn, there can be no negotiations,"" Pirc Musar said.

Optimistic about Slovenia's bid for the UN Security Council, the president said that Slovenia was known as a country with its own opinions and, unlike some European countries, no colonial past. Slovenia's lobbying is most intense when it comes to African countries and they have no resentment directed at Slovenia, she added.",politics
Doctors' trade union Fides to resume strike on 2 April (adds),"Fides, the trade union of doctors and dentists, announced on Wednesday that industrial action, averted after two deals reached with the government last October and in January, would proceed on 2 April, because the government has postponed the agreed formation of a separate pay tier for the healthcare system by 1 April.","While it had been expected that representatives of the government and healthcare and social care unions would continue with substantive talks on the separate pay tier today, the government announced the deadline would need to be pushed back to 30 June.

The original timeline stipulated a formation of a separate tier in the public sector pay system by 1 April, its submission to legislative procedure by 30 June and implementation by 1 January 2024. If the tier is not introduced by 1 January 2024, the government committed to eliminating the disparities in doctors' and dentists' pay in separate negotiations with Fides.

The head of the Trade Union of Healthcare Workers Slavica Mencinger said that the reason given for the delay by the government was the need for additional calculations and for coordinating things in the central talks with all representative public sector trade unions scheduled for next Monday.

While Mencinger had expected that ""matters will not be resolved in such a short time"", the union remains sceptical because, in her words, things always just end up being pushed back.

The delay also did not surprise Irena Ilešič Čujovič, president of the Trade Union of Health Care and Social Care, who said the foundations for the new tier were needed first. ""Perhaps the government needed a bit longer to realise this,"" she said.

Fides's Gregor Zemljič took a harder stance, saying that ""today, unfortunately, we witnessed an attempt to take away the power of the agreement signed by Fides and the government, with deadlines being called into question"". ""We do not see any objective reason for this,"" he added.

Fides announced it would continue to actively and constructively participate in the negotiations to form the new pay tier, with the aim of having it in place by 1 April. If this does not materialise, the suspended strike by doctors and dentists will continue on 2 April, it added.

In case of a strike, doctors will work the required minimum, performing tasks whose neglect would lead to irreversible damage to health or death. For the most part, they are expected to work on a holiday schedule.

The Health Ministry told the STA that it had not yet been officially informed of the strike announcement. ""The government side will continue negotiations with the representative health and social care unions on Wednesday,"" the ministry added.",labour
Mladina praises govt for speedy EU funds renegotiation,"Mladina praises in its commentary on Friday Prime Minister Robert Golob over the speed with which Slovenia has renegotiated a substantial amount of EU funding since devastating floods hit the country, but warns that deadlines are very short and that the preparation of projects and reports is not Slovenia's strong suit.","The weekly also praises Golob for inviting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Črna na Koroškem, one of the most severely affected parts of the country. It is impossible for a politician to turn down a request when surrounded by victims.

Mladina goes on to list in detail the EU funds that will be available to Slovenia, but indicates that the deadlines are very short.

Much of the work will have to be done by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning, which has fared the worst in the entire government in terms of funds drawing.

The EU funding plan was presented by von der Leyen only five days after the floods hit, and this time period included a weekend, Mladina notes.

""This is completely new for Slovenian governments, this speed. We won't say that von der Leyen was pushed into a corner, but it is a fact that the Slovenian government (likely the prime minister) was aware that the moment must be seized when floods were still fresh.""

""But it is also true that projects, estimates and reports now need to be drafted, which is the hardest part and our weak spot,"" the weekly says under the headline What Has Ursula von der Leyen Promised?",politics
Stricter criteria planned for foreign direct investments,The government is planning stricter criteria for subsidising foreign direct investments according to draft amendments to the investment promotion act that the Economy Ministry unveiled on Wednesday. The draft will now be the subject of public consultation until 23 March.,"Under the proposed amendments, conditions for subsidising foreign direct investments may include prohibition of the sale of copyrights owned of the target company to third-country parties or of certain assets acquired through the investment. A ban on the sale of a certain share in the target company would also be possible.

Investors may also be required to commit to preserve certain shares of the target company in Slovenia and not relocate certain sensitive activities from the target company to another legal entity in Slovenia. A commitment to perform the target company's original activity in Slovenia could also be imposed.

An instrument is furthermore planned to prevent transactions undertaken by investors from third countries to be camouflaged behind EU entities.

A foreign direct investment would be defined as the acquisition of at least 10% of the target company's equity or voting rights, either directly or indirectly.

A limit would also be placed on the rights to land and buildings that are essential to critical infrastructure or located near critical infrastructure.

One of the emergency laws passed during the pandemic introduced a temporary mechanism for the review of foreign direct investments that would expire in mid-2023. Under the proposal, this mechanism, which is in the form of a commission, would be made permanent.

The commission for the review of foreign direct investments will set the conditions for each individual investment and has the power to deny investment request in line with EU regulations and guidelines, the government says.","economy, business and finance"
Committee backs changes to digital literacy law passed under previous govt,"The parliamentary Home Affairs Committee has endorsed in a 9:4 vote changes to the digital inclusion act passed a year ago under the previous government. The coalition sees the changes as a stopgap measure allowing the government to draft a brand new bill, while the opposition has accused the government of abolishing some good solutions.","Digital Transformation Minister Emilija Stojmenova Duh told the committee on Tuesday that the bill is a response to the many grievances, also about discrimination, that the public, including the human rights ombudsman, had about the law.

With the latest changes, digital inclusion measures will reach ""the most vulnerable groups that need encouragement in digital inclusion the most"", she said.

While the original law defined target groups in advance and in detail, such as school children, students and the over-55s, this will no longer be the case.

Target groups will be set based on indicators such as their social standing or the level of urbanisation of their place of residence, she explained.

The bill does not abolish digital vouchers for purchase of digital equipment but introduces an option of free-of-charge borrowing of basic computer equipment.

""And we are also working on a brand new bill, but until it is implemented, changes to the existing law are needed,"" said the minister.

Coalition MPs agreed this was the best temporary solution, with MP Jonas Žnidaršič (SocDems) saying they ""expect the ministry to draft the new bill as soon as possible"".

Anja Bah Žibert from the opposition Democrats (SDS) said such extensive changes will abolish the good solutions that have brought Slovenia closer to EU digital inclusion guidelines. She doubts that an analysis on which the changes are said to be based really exists.

The most critical of all MPs was the SDS's Branko Grims, who said that the government simply wants to enable taxpayer money to flow to NGOs.

""This bill improves nothing, it only blurs certain things,"" he said, putting forward a proposal that the bill is not fit for further reading because it could be termed ""a bill on systemic corruption"", but the resolution was voted down.

Last summer, Stojmenova Duh decided to suspend all activities related to free-of-charge IT courses for citizens aged 55 or more who were included in the digital vouchers scheme after some irregularities had been detected. IT courses were a precondition for the elderly to redeem their digital vouchers to buy IT devices.",social issue

"President Pirc Musar paying working visit to Italy, Vatican (background)","President Nataša Pirc Musar will be on a working visit to Italy and the Vatican from Friday to Monday. The talks with her Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella are expected to focus on bilateral relations, the situation of minorities and the situation in Ukraine. The latter will also be discussed as Pirc Musar meets Pope Francis.","Pirc Musar will meet with Mattarella on Friday in what will be their first official meeting. They previously met at the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in Vatican City in January and at the recent coronation of King Charles III in London.

The working visit is a continuation of regular dialogue at the highest level between Slovenia and Italy, the president's office has announced in a press release.

Pirc Musar and Mattarella are scheduled to talk about bilateral relations which, as former President Borut Pahor noted during his farewell visit to Italy last December, are good and friendly.

Italy is also one of the most important trading partners for Slovenia, with trade between the countries exceeding EUR 12 billion last year, having grown considerably compared to the year before.

Also expected to top the agenda of the presidents' talks is the situation of the Slovenian minority in Italy and vice versa, as representatives of both minorities briefed Pirc Musar on the challenges they face ahead of her visit to Rome.

Representatives of the Slovenian minority in Italy presented their efforts for the guaranteed representation in the Italian parliament to be implemented, with the chances of election for Slovenians strongly decreasing due to the latest reform.

Pirc Musar was also briefed about the issues related to the election to the regional parliament of Friuli Venezia Giulia, which is of vital importance for the Slovenian minority.

The Slovenian president assured the minority representatives that she would watch over the procedure to returning the National Hall in Trieste to the Slovenian community, a memorandum on which was signed in July 2020.

Pirc Musar and Mattarella are also expected to talk about the 2025 European Capital of Culture cross-border project hosted by Slovenia's Nova Gorica and Italy's Gorizia.

Meeting the minority representatives, Pirc Musar pledged her support for the project and expressed the hope that the minorities on both sides of the border would seize the opportunities offered by the project to the greatest possible extent.

The Slovenian and Italian presidents are expected to touch on the developments of the Russo-Ukrainian war, as both countries are providing assistance and support to Kyiv and note that that they will continue to do so as long as necessary.

They will also talk about the situation in the Western Balkans, where both countries want to play an active role and support the EU accession prospects of the countries in the region.

Slovenia and Italy want to cooperate in managing migration on the Western Balkan migration route, along which an increasing number of migrants are coming to Slovenia and then to Italy after Croatia has joined the Schengen Area.

Also on Friday, Pirc Musar will launch an international event at the seat of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to mark World Bee Day, which was declared for 20 May on Slovenia's initiative in 2017.

On the occasion, she will meet FAO director-general Qu Dongyu and Cindy McCain, the newly-appointed executive director of the World Food Programme.

On the following day, Pirc Musar will visit Slovenian soldiers stationed in Naples as part of an international mission. She will also meet representatives of the local authorities and Jacopo Fronzoni, Slovenia's honorary consul in Naples.

On Sunday, the president will be received by Pope Francis, and she will also meet Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state, and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, secretary for relations with states within the Holy See's Secretariat of State.

The visit by Pirc Musar to the Vatican is continuation of regular dialogue between Slovenia and the Vatican. Her predecessor Pahor paid an official visit last February, while Pope Francis received Prime Minister Robert Golob and at the end of last year.

The talks in the Vatican will focus on the topical global issues, with the war in Ukraine topping the agenda of the meeting with Pope Francis.

On Sunday, Pirc Musar will also meet Slovenian Cardinal Franc Rode and other Slovenians who live in the Vatican.

After she concludes her trip to Italy, Pirc Musar will have visited all four of Slovenia's neighbouring countries after assuming office last December. She first paid a visit to Croatia in February, and then to Hungary and Austria in April.",politics
"Golob, Fajon pledge continued support for Ukraine year after Russian invasion","On the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Robert Golob and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon pledged continued support for Ukraine for as long as necessary. They said Slovenia would make an effort to ensure a just and lasting peace in the war-stricken country and that it is bound to offer aid by the UN Charter.","Golob said in a written statement that Slovenia and its allies were committed to resolving the conflict peacefully, but the call for an immediate end to the war could only be addressed to Moscow.

""Only after the aggression stops can diplomacy, and with it peace, have a chance,"" he noted, adding that ""the provisions of the UN Charter not only call for aid but also mandate UN member states to help the victim of an aggressive war.""

Noting Slovenia's own historical memory, Foreign Minister Fajon finds it inadmissible that civilians, including women and children, are killed every single day and civilian infrastructure is being targetted.

""It is hard to imagine today that someone is trying to illegally and unlawfully usurp the territory, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country by force of arms,"" Fajon reiterated in a statement released on the eve of the anniversary.

Both also backed all efforts to clearly distinguish the aggressor from the victim, stressing Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine the victim.

""We must do everything we can through diplomatic channels to stop the attacks, killings and the destruction of infrastructure, and to create the conditions for talks, for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine,"" Fajon said, adding that ""Ukraine and all of us"" want peace.

The prime minister said it was a civilizational achievement that helping and supporting victims in their self-defence was not only permissible, but also a moral obligation for all those who reject violence and advocate peaceful solutions in international relations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on Ukraine on 24 February 2022 in what he dubbed a ""special military operation"". Russia expected it to last only a couple of days but faced a strong resistance from the Ukrainians.

""As one of the UN's founding members and guarantors of peace after World War II, Russia's responsibility is that much greater, and its actions in Ukraine for the past year are that much more reprehensible,"" Golob said.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Court finds dismissal of fmr Forest Service head unlawful,The Administrative Court has found that the dismissal of former Forest Service head Damjan Oražem by the previous government had been unlawful. Oražem said on Wednesday that the ruling was final and that he intended to take the state to court.,"Oražem was dismissed by the Janez Janša government in September 2020 on the proposal of the then Agriculture Minister Aleksandra Pivec. He had been in charge of the Forest Service since 2013.

Following the court's decision, he told the STA he planned to file a lawsuit against the state at the labour court to fight for pay compensation and a damages lawsuit for libel.

""Monetary compensation cannot repair the moral damage I have suffered. Those who caused it are not being held accountable in any way,"" said Oražem.

When he was dismissed, the government did not state any concrete reasons for the decision, but Pivec highlighted beforehand some of accusations raised against Oražem in certain media, for instance Portal Plus and Nova24TV.

There was for instance talk of mobbing, abuse of office, unwarranted overtime payments, contentious hiring, and failure to secure funding and proper conditions for hunting activities. Oražem dismissed all the accusations.

He said today he vied for the position of Forest Service head once again last year, but his bid was thrown away by mistake, he learnt from the person in charge of the call.",labour
Delo says W Balkan's progress towards EU is forced compromise,"Delo says in Saturday's front-page commentary that the progress of the Western Balkans on the region's path to the EU accession is a ""forced compromise"" and that it has become tangible only when the war in Ukraine started after almost two decades of empty promises.","Under the headline Dead End in Quicksand in the Middle of Nowhere, the newspaper notes that Slovenian diplomacy is quick to erroneously boast with results of what are otherwise genuine efforts to enlarge the EU to the Western Balkans.

Although Bosnia and Herzegovina got the candidate status, and the citizens of Kosovo no longer need visas to travel to Europe, it is quite clear that this ""progress"" did not make anyone happy.

No one in Bosnia and Herzegovina truly believes that candidate status is the result of a stronger rule of law, the state of human rights or the standard of living, Delo notes.

This is a ""forced compromise"" due to the fear that, without such a compromise, the war could easily spill over from Ukraine to the Balkans and thus further destabilise Europe. This fear is stronger than the will to insist on the strict EU standards.

Because the EU ignored its south-eastern neighbourhood for many years, powerful, rich and influential players from Turkey, China and Russia started to gain influence there, the newspaper adds.

""Disorder, the divide between ethnic communities, organised crime and disorganised states led by incompetent nationalists are useful for Russia,"" concludes the commentary.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Drug ring leader gets 12 and a half years in prison,"Aleš Zupančič, allegedly one of the suspects in a recently dismantled drug ring, has been found guilty of drug production and trafficking by the Ljubljana District Court and sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison in a case dating back to 2017-2020.","He also received a EUR 5,000 fine and must pay EUR 150,000 in illegal gains to the state, the newspaper Večer reported online on Tuesday.

The court ruled that Zupančič was the leader of a very well organised drug trafficking ring, finding him guilty of 17 criminal acts. He organised drug deals and recruited new members, among other things.

He received an aggregated sentence of 14 years and four months, as the court took into account two more years in prison stemming from a drug trafficking sentence ordered by the Celje District Court in 2018.

Zupančič is currently serving the prison sentence ordered by the Celje District Court in Koper prison. He started serving it in the form of weekend prison, serving 11 months this way, Večer reported.

Then, he got arrested on 19 January 2020 for the crimes he was found guilty of today, and sent to detention. Detention ended in June 2022, two years after the indictment was filed, and he went back to serving the sentence ordered by the Celje court.

The sentencing comes six months after eight other defendants in this case were found guilty of drug trafficking in Slovenia, Croatia and Austria. The ring was charged with having made EUR 1.3 million in illegal gains. Zupančič was excluded from the initial trial due to illness.

Today's sentencing comes on the heels of reports that Zupančič was part of a drug ring brought down by the Slovenian and Austrian police only last week.","crime, law and justice"
Govt okays boosting of capabilities in medium-term defence programme,"The government approved on Wednesday the medium-term defence programme for 2023-2028, which prioritises the development of military capabilities and an increase in the number of Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) personnel on missions abroad.","The programme, adopted based on the resolution on the long-term development of the SAF until 2040, also envisages the consolidation of the cyber domain as an operational domain of the Defence Ministry, the Government Communication Office said.

The document has the Defence Ministry prioritising the development of a medium infantry battalion, of a medium-sized battalion battle group and modules of a medium-sized reconnaissance battalion battle group.

The modernisation of equipment will be directed towards achieving medium-term development priorities, while the ministry will also accelerate the development of the domestic defence industry.

In aviation, the ministry will prioritise the establishment of light helicopter capabilities and helicopter capabilities to support the operations of special forces, as well as the establishment of the first air defence battery and the development of the Cerklje ob Krki air base.

By providing support to the military and allied forces, the ministry also aims to strengthen the resilience of the country against other threats. The programme states that civil defence will support and complement military defence by developing civil capabilities in times of peace, crisis, emergency situations, and war.

Another novelty is the establishment of the cyber domain as a planned and operational domain, as part of which the ministry plans to develop cyber security through the reinforcement of communication and information infrastructure.

The programme also envisages the accelerated development of the domestic defence industry, both for the development of defence capabilities and for innovations related to digital technologies and the digital transformation.

As for military capabilities that the country cannot provide independently, the ministry will develop them through participation in EU and European Defence Agency projects, as well as through regional cooperation.

Twenty percent of the military budget is envisaged for investment, while 2% is allocated to research and development. The Defence Ministry concluded the document with a commitment to increase the level of SAF participation in EU military missions and operations.

Meanwhile, the government also decided that the SAF will not participate in three international military exercises: the Allied Spirit exercise in Germany, the training with live chemical agents in Slovakia, and the integration exercise of the 72nd Brigade. In place of the latter, the Slovenian military will participate in cross-training of partner units for the EU battle group 2024.

The government also confirmed participation in the operational and tactical exercise Milex 23, as well as - based on an invitation from the Colorado National Guard - in surgical operations training for combat injuries at the University of Chicago.",science and technology
Slovenian ski jumping team finishes second in Planica,"Slovenian ski jumpers Lovro Kos, Domen Prevc, Timi Zajc and Anže Lanišek finished second at the team event of the Ski Jumping World Cup Finals in Planica on Saturday. The Austrian team won gold and Norwegians were third.","Powered by the energy of some 20,000 fans, the Slovenian ski jumpers finished the first round in the first place, followed by the Norwegian and Austrian teams.

But the start of the second round brought a change at the top as Austrian Daniel Tschofenig made an excellent jump to beat Slovenia's Kos and Norway's Johann Andre Forfang.

Prevc jumped 239.5 metres and again took the lead, which Slovenia retained after Zajc's jump. Stefan Kraft delivered an excellent performance at 235.5 metres, but Lanišek's advantage seemed enough for a victory. But after an excellent jump he did not land perfectly, which brought victory to team Austria.

Kos, Prevc, Zajc and Lanišek scored 1,682 points and were just 6.1 points behind Austria, while Norway were 27.4 points behind Slovenia.

This is the second podium result for the Slovenian men's team this season after the second place they bagged in Lahti, Finland.

""It was a really good fight with Austria up to the last jump. We were in the game for victory but the second place is still a superb achievement,"" the team's coach Robert Hrgota told the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija.

""Unfortunately, I didn't pull out what I could have after jumping off. When I was there, I thought it would go far. I thought the jump-off was pretty good and I felt strong in the squat. But I was a bit short and unfortunately I was the one who left the victory here. It's still a great result, we jumped well no matter what. Of course there is a bit of a bitter aftertaste and I can only apologise to the guys,"" Lanišek told RTV Slovenija.

Lanišek was second in today's individual event, which was moved to this morning because yesterday the wind was too strong.",sport

Mladina hopes for new conservatism in Slovenia,"The left-wing magazine Mladina calls for ""new conservatism"" in Slovenia, which it says should weaken Janez Janša and his Democrats (SDS), thus allowing new people from both left and right to enter politics.","The weekly's editorial headlined Helping the Right argues that the SDS is not a conservative party but still it has occupied the whole conservative space and is quick to stifle any attempt at creating an autonomous conservative party apart from the Christian democrats or New Slovenia (NSi), whom it has been ""suffocating since the 1990s"".

""Since being taken over by Janša, the SDS has been functioning not as a party but as a company on the one hand and as a sect on the other ... They are a community of extreme politicians by their views and methods.""

The paper writes that since the SDS and Janša have been ""cleansing"" the space right of the centre and nipping any initiative they do not control in the bud, moderate conservative intellectuals avoid politics.

""For years, political analysts have been repeating that the SDS clogs social and political development in Slovenia - on the left they say it loudly, on the right they say it quietly, because they know that otherwise they will be immediately discredited.""

However, the paper sees an indication that a shift has happened: ""think of New Slovenia and Matej Tonin publicly expressing their disagreement with Janez Janša, Anže Logar's hesitant and somewhat calculating attempts to distance himself from Janez Janša, or the initiatives taken by conservative entrepreneurs"".

The paper says the left needs a strong right bloc for society to make progress. ""The left's answers to social issues today are too simple, not ambitious enough, in fact the Slovenian left bloc is very backward - but this is party because it takes very little to be more convincing than the right bloc ...""",politics
New investment for Brežice-based start-up,"Juicefast, a start-up based in Brežice that produces healthy meals and juices, has received an investment by two Croatian entrepreneurs Mate Rimac and Sandro Mur. The amount of the investment has not been disclosed.","The investment will allow Juicefast to continue the development of innovative production technology and expand to other European markets, the company noted on Thursday.

Juicefast, manufacturer of cold-pressed juices and balanced meals, was founded in 2020 by brothers David and Marko Dravinec. The company has been successful in the Croatian market. This year Juicefast will focus on the Slovenian market as well, where it is already developing business activities.

Juicefast has more than 50,000 customers in Croatia and more than 500 monthly subscribers. It has recently expanded to Slovenia as well. The company currently employs 20 people and is planning to hire more.

The company is currently focusing on the business-to-customer segment, mostly through the online store. In the future they will devote more attention to the corporative sector and other business-to-business channels, noted David Dravinec.

""I have always believed in the Juicefast vision, but having the support of two of the masters of this game, Sandro and Mate, gives me even more motivation to realise everything we have planned,"" he added.

""In the last few years I have supported and invested in multiple home business early-stage projects with the goal to strengthen the local ecosystem of start-ups,"" said Rimac, the founder of supercars maker Rimac Automobili.

""When I think who to support, I consider most important the team behind the project, expansion beyond our borders and the potential for the growth of economy and job creation,"" he added.

Mur, CEO and co-founder of the wellness company Bellabeat, said that he had been using Juicefast products and then came to realise the potential behind the brand.

""We are used to the tech sector being the sector with the largest breakthroughs in the start-up industry, but I'm certain that a healthy lifestyle and everything that Juicefast represents is the future,"" Mur said.

Juicefast already received a large financial injection in September, when the Croatian venture capital fund Feelsgood and Mur invested EUR 750,000 in the company. The largest investor in Feelsgood is the European Investment Fund, while with EUR 6 million the largest private investor is the company Bellabeat.",health
New Year's Day morning warmest on record,"Slovenia is celebrating the warmest New Year's Day on record, as temperatures climbed over 15 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country on Sunday morning. ""This is definitely the warmest New Year's since the beginning of record keeping,"" Blaž Šter, a meteorologist of the Environmental Agency told the STA.","At 7 am, 15.2 degrees Celsius were measured in Dobliče pri Črnomlju, while Ptuj and Kočevje saw the quicksilver climb to 13.8 degrees.

It was just over 12 degrees in Ljubljana at 7 am, similar to the temperature measures at midnight, when thousands celebrated out in the streets. ""New Year's Eve was exceptionally warm,"" Šter said.

There are some unseasonably warm New Year's on record, but temperatures never exceeded 10 degrees Celsius before, said Šter.

On the other hand, there are also some very cold ones on record, albeit a long time ago. In 1968, it was -12 degrees Celsius in Ljubljana at midnight and in 1853 it was a frigid -19 degrees.

Weather will remain unseasonably warm until next weekend, when a cold front will reach Slovenia. However, the drops in temperature will not be too significant, said Šter.

He does not expect a very cold winter, but also does not expect the highest January temperature record to be broken. It was set on 29 January 2002, when 21.4 degrees were recorded in Slovenske Konjice.",weather
Medical Chamber and Union of Patients sign cooperation agreement,"The Medical Chamber and the Union of Patient Associations signed a cooperation agreement on Wednesday to improve dialogue and implement the fundamental goals of healthcare for all patients. The chamber's head Bojana Beović said the deal meant they would meet, exchange views on various topics and possibly draft joint positions.","Among the goals of the cooperation is creating conditions to have enough capabilities, including staff and funds, to provide timely, quality and safe healthcare, the chamber said in a press release after the signing ceremony.

Another goal is the establishment of a new national system of quality and safety of healthcare for patients and their relatives, including the introduction of liability of the state in the event of complications in treatment.

Beović said that it was important to know the problems of both sides. ""Then we can form some common positions to meet the wishes and needs of patients on the one hand, and to enable doctors and healthcare professionals to carry out the highest possible quality of professional work on the other.""

Štefanija Lukič Zlobec, the president of the patients' union, said there had been a lack of dialogue between doctor organisations and the patients' umbrella organisation so far.

""It's important that we have reached this agreement and that there will be more dialogue and better conditions as a result,"" she said.

The union was formed last year when more than 20 patient associations joined forces to promote the voice of patients.

Lukič Zlobec said that the main purpose of the union was to find better solutions for patients and all health professionals.

Next week, the civil group Voice of the People will organise a protest to demand access to a GP for all, the abolition of top-up health insurance and putting an end to the flow of public funds to private healthcare providers. The protest will take place on 10 January, a day before a one-day strike called by doctors.",health
NGO reported to police over referendum campaign funding from abroad,"The youth wing of the opposition Democrats (SDS) has reported the 8 March Institute to the police and the Court of Audit for having financed its referendum campaign against a waters bill with funds from abroad. The NGO has responded by saying it did get EUR 30,000 from a German foundation, but almost a year after the 2021 referendum.","Under Slovenian law, organisers of election and referendum campaigns cannot use funds obtained from foreign legal or physical persons to finance such campaigns.

The 8 March Institute campaigned heavily against the changes to the waters act, which were passed under the previous, SDS-led government but defeated in the July 2021 referendum.

Speaking to the press on Thursday, the Slovenian Democratic Youth (SDM) said that the NGO as an organiser of the referendum campaign had violated the law.

The SDM's vice president Nejc Brence said that the 8 March Institute had received EUR 30,000 from Guerrila Foundation and transferred it to its referendum campaign account.

He labelled the Berlin-based foundation as an ""organisation which encourages with its funds radical leftist activists"".

Nika Kovač, director of the 8 March Institute, rejected the allegations, saying they had received the funds but only in April 2022, almost a year after the referendum.

""The referendum campaign for clear drinking water was largely financed by the NGO Ekokrog, which raised donations from people, while the Institute spent only around EUR 3,000 on the entire referendum campaign,"" she told the STA and TV Slovenija.

She accused the SDM of an attempt to silence them, but stressed they ""won't silenced, it's just that our lawyers will have a bit more work to do, because we are already checking whether we can take the SDM to court for lies"".

The NGO is ready to give all the documents about the referendum campaign funding and the funds obtained from Guerilla Foundation to relevant authorities.

The SDM meanwhile expects the case to be thoroughly investigated, ""at least to the extent the SDS was investigated in all election campaigns - for every cent, for every step, the way it should be"", said Brence.",politics
Rating up for govt in POP TV poll,"The Robert Golob government has reversed the trend of falling voter approval ratings by announcing it will scrap top-up health insurance, the latest poll run by the commercial broadcaster POP TV suggests. Its rating in the poll was up for the first time in four months.","The poll, conducted by Mediana, shows the government enjoying the support of 45.5% of those questioned, against 41.9% who say the opposite. While the share of supporters rose by 4 percentage points from the month before, the proportion of the opponents fell by half a point.

The prime minister's Freedom Movement gained 0.9 points over the past month to 24.4% as the Democrats (SDS) of the former PM Janez Janša lost 0.6 points to 22.2%, according to the poll, which was released on Sunday evening.

Golob's coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SD) polled level at 6.6%, and the Left lost a point to 4.2%, while the opposition party New Slovenia (NSi) gained 0.6 points to 5.7%.

The best faring non-parliamentary party is the anti-vaxxer Truth at 3.6%.

The proportion of the undecided fell by 3.2 points to 13.3%. A further 7.7% would not vote for any of the parties on offer and 1% did not wish to answer the question.

Anže Logar, the SDS MP and former foreign minister, continues as the best rated politician ahead of President Nataša Pirc Musar, who changed places with Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan. Golob remains in fourth.

The poll was conducted by Mediana among 717 respondents between 17 and 20 April.",politics
Dnevnik says anti-flood funds allocated without due procedure,"The newspaper Dnevnik accuses the Water Agency of distributing EU anti-flood funds without due procedure or criteria, and without giving priority to high-risk areas, saying that this is how Slovenia has been managing flood-protection funds for years, and no one has been held accountable.","""The Water Agency, headed by Neža Kodre, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning, headed by Uroš Brežan, have found themselves in a serious predicament.

""The European Commission has granted them Recovery and Resilience Facility funds worth EUR 335 million, but the agency and the ministry cannot explain on which basis the funds were distributed among the chosen 34 municipalities.""

The EUR 335 million for anti-flood investment is by far the single largest sum in the country's Recovery and Resilience Plan, which started to be drawn up under the previous government, which had not yet picked specific projects, but did, ""under the watchful eye of Brussels, lay down criteria to be met by selected projects, as well as the procedure for their selection"".

The first rule was to make sure the projects contribute to efforts to reduce flood risk in identified high-risk areas, and the first step in selecting the projects was to invite high-risk municipalities to participate.

Dnevnik's investigation shows that the Water Agency, which sealed investment agreements with municipalities, has ignored both of these procedures, since the 34 selected municipalities include as many as 15 where there are no high-risk areas.

""This is how we have been managing flood control funds for years, and no one is being held accountable,"" says the commentary Bypassing Rules in EU Funds Distribution, noting the Court of Audit's findings about the Water Fund, Slovenia's regular source of anti-flood funding, and its non-transparent and arbitrary management.

However, the EUR 335 million allocation case is not about the national funds but about EU funds, says the commentary, hopeful that this time around bypassing rules will not be possible in the end.","economy, business and finance"
Three judiciary bills sent into public consultation,The Justice Ministry has sent into public consultation the bills on courts and on judges and amendments to the law on the Judicial Council. One of the main changes is the introduction of a one-tier system of courts of first instance.,"The courts bill envisages the abolishment of the two-tier system of first-instance courts with local courts and district courts.

The ministry now proposes that the basic organisational level for courts is a judicial district.

It says that the current organisation has several shortcomings, limiting the court presidents' options to provide for equal workload of all judges within a judicial district.

Under the current legislation, the court president can assign a local court judge to a district court only for a limited period, which is not a long-term solution to tackling backlog at the level of district courts.

""Data shows that district courts are more burdened than local courts, as a result of which a client at a district court gets justice later than a client at a local court,"" the ministry said on Monday.

Providing mechanisms for efficient judicial district management, the bill aims to improve access to courts, enhance the judiciary's efficiency and quality and boost trust in it, it added.

The bill also brings changes to the areas covered by higher courts and to security in courts while regulating the institute of expanded panels of judges.

The Judicial Council will meanwhile get new powers in that it will also appoint the president of the Supreme Court, not just presidents of lower-instance courts.

The ministry believes this will reduce political influence on appointments, while boosting the independence of the judiciary and the role of the Judicial Council.

With the abolition of the two-tier system of first-instance courts, titles of judges will be adjusted accordingly in the proposed judicial service bill.

There will be no more distinction between local court judges and district court judges, while the system of evaluation and promotion will be reformed alongside disciplinary liability of judges and the provisions on the termination of judicial office.

The public consultation period for both bills ends on 7 November.

Some changes will also be made to the Judicial Council Act, including to adjust it to a Constitutional Court ruling regarding the council's role in disciplinary proceedings. The changes will be in public consultation until 6 November.","crime, law and justice"
SocDem think-tank to be launched next week,"A new social democratic think-tank will become active next week, primarily striving to include experts and public in the drafting of public policies, the head of the think-tank's expert council, Anja Kopač, told the press on Thursday. The 1 May Institute was set up by the head of junior coalition Social Democrats (SD), Tanja Fajon.","The new think-tank plans to partner with other EU SocDem institutes such as the German Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Austrian Karl Renner Institut, Swedish Olaf Palme Center and the Foundation for Progressive European Studies, which brings together related foundations at EU level, said Kopač, a former labour minister.

The core of the think-tank is currently a 10-member expert council, which includes university professors and PhD holders in the fields of law, sociology, economics and history, as well as individuals who have contributed significantly to the development of Slovenian politics in the past, including former MP Rado Bohinc, historian Božo Repe, founder of the Women's Lobby Sonja Lokar, and Helena Kamnar, former president's economic advisor.

""This is the intellectual basis which is to conduct a responsible dialogue also wider,"" said Kopač.

The new institute will be based at the headquarters of the junior coalition party Social Democrats (SD) in Levstikova Street, while according to web portal N1 the SD is moving to a new building in Nazorjeva Street in Ljubljana's city centre.

The villa at 15 Levstikova Street will be renamed the House of Progressive Ideas and will also be home to other NGOs such as the Institute for Economic Democracy.

The new think-tank will host a conference in Ljubljana on 25 May where key EU issues, social-democratic ideas and the role of political foundations in supporting European integration and shaping public policies will be discussed with guests from similar political foundations from other countries.

The 1 May Institute was founded by the SD head, Tanja Fajon, and the party's secretary general Klemen Žibert.",education
Tourism panel in Bled notes vital role of tourism workers for sector's development,"The tourism sector is grappling with multiple challenges, and addressing them effectively will rely heavily on tourism workers, who are hard to come by, stressed speakers at Tuesday's tourism panel at the Bled Strategic Forum. The panellists also agreed on the need for accelerated digitisation for the industry to grow.","Opening the discussion, Slovenian Tourist Board (STO) head Maja Pak painted a picture of the current state of affairs. ""Hotels are severely understaffed, restaurants are closed on certain days, and the best tourist guides are booked well in advance. The question arises - where have they all gone, what have we done wrong?""

While the Covid-19 pandemic worsened conditions, Pak noted that labour shortages are not a new issue. ""However, the situation has never been as acute,"" she said. Changing demographics, an ageing workforce, limitations on hiring foreign workers, unmet demands for better wages and more flexible working hours were identified by Pak as some of the root causes.

""Let's be honest, the tourism industry has become a sector where employees often look for better opportunities in other fields,"" she asserted at the panel debate entitled The Knowledge Society and the Future Tourism Professions.

The pandemic-induced chaos and the backdrop of climate change have ushered in Generation Z into the labour market, Pak further said.

""Studies suggest that by 2030, Gen Z and millennials will make up two-thirds of the workforce,"" she explained, noting that the industry will not only be influenced by their digital skills but also by the values of these generations. Pak also stressed the need to consider those above the age of 50 too.

State Secretary at the Slovenian Economy Ministry of Economic Development, Tourism and Sport Matevž Frangež also highlighted the vital role of individuals in tourism. He described working in tourism as ""one of the most rewarding missions one can imagine"".

While speaking of the national strategy aimed at increasing the industry's added value, Frangež also noted the sector had faced devastating floods this month. Still, the industry has seen record numbers with 3.5 million tourist arrivals and 2.9 million overnight stays.

Alessandra Priante, director of the Regional Department for Europe at the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), stressed Slovenia remained a safe destination for tourists post-floods.

Highlighting the importance of continuity in the tourism sector, Priante also addressed the issue of personnel and suggested that it is foremost communication that needs to be improved.

Development in tourism must occur hand-in-hand with local communities, Priante added. She illustrated the situation in Italy, where tourists expect romantic experiences during their city visits, but often discover that the local population has vanished. She commended Slovenia in this aspect.

Dubravka Kalin, director general of the Tourism Directorate at the Ministry of Economic Development, acknowledged the challenges of working in tourism. ""Being part of the tourism industry is like being a gladiator. It's demanding work, and you need to truly love the sector not just to survive, but to feel good about one's work.""

The ministry is attempting to address labour shortages through various measures, including motivating young people to not just work short-term in tourism but to stay in the field.

The importance of education was stressed by Ulrika Björklund, executive director of the Swiss Education Group, and Danica Purg, founder and director of the IEDC - Bled School of Management.

Björklund noted the importance of balancing theoretical and practical knowledge and of sharing success stories, so that young people can understand the immense potential within the industry.

Purg also spoke of the need to help those working in tourism to become more innovative, creative, and equipped with digital skills.

Rodney Dunn, culinary expert and founder of The Agrarian Kitchen in Australia, highlighted that the challenges facing tourism are global, not exclusive to Europe or Australia.

Slovenian Minister of Digital Transformation Emilija Stojmenova Duh also touched on digitalisation. She said the ministry is focusing on securing adequate infrastructure that benefits tourism as well. ""It's a challenge, as it's quite expensive to provide internet access to every mountain and valley,"" she said.

Marie Audren, director general of the European Hotel, Restaurant, Cafe, and Nightclub Association (HOTREC), echoed the theme of digitalisation, agreeing that while digitalisation can contribute to tourism development, it won't be a complete solution. Jobs won't disappear, but they will change, she said.",lifestyle and leisure
Outgoing natural resources minister says he's done everything he could,"Outgoing Minister of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Uroš Brežan has told the press that he decided to resign after PM Robert Golob told him their ways were parting. Although he understands and respects Golob's decision, he regrets the resignation, saying he had done everything post-floods that could be done in the given situation.","Golob said on Wednesday that Brežan lost his trust due to post-flood relief efforts, where the ministry failed to restructure organisationally fast enough to rise up to the challenge. ""Autumn and winter are coming, we really have to speed things up, and this is the main reason, the only reason for the departure,"" he said.

Speaking to the press on Thursday, Brežan said that Golob had invited him to a meeting on Monday afternoon to tell him that they were parting ways. ""I understand and respect that the prime minister wants someone in my place who is more compatible with his views.""

Brežan sent in his resignation on Wednesday afternoon, but regrets that it came at the time when a bill on post-flood reconstruction is being drafted.

He and his team have done everything that could be done in the given circumstances, including beefing up staff at the ministry and the Water Agency and securing additional funds to eliminate the consequences of natural disasters and more funds for watercourses management in the budgets for 2024 in 2025.

He believes that it is not enough to carry out post-flood measures but that management of watercourses must become a priority for the ministry and a key part of the climate change strategy.

Brežan also said that his ministry had given more focus to protection of nature, raising it to the level of a directorate, adding: ""I regret that I will no longer lead this good team in the future.""

Brežan is moreover concerned about how spatial planning will develop during the post-flood reconstruction, warning against easy and populist solutions.

""On the one hand, there are long-term solutions that are based on expertise and are socially acceptable, and on the other hand, there are quick, convenient solutions, often to the benefit of vested interests, which in the long run do far more harm than good,"" he said.

He believes that decision-makers have a huge responsibility that goes far beyond those directly affected by the floods. He thus urged a broad social consensus about spatial planning that can be achieved together with experts, civil society groups and local communities. ""And the solutions must be in the broadest public interest.""

Brežan did not take questions from the press. Once parliament gets acquainted with his resignation, Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek will serve as a stand-in until a new minister is appointed.",disaster and accident
Photographer Sophie Thun bringing her studios to Cukrarna,The art gallery Cukrarna in Ljubljana will turn into an art studio of photographer Sophie Thun as her exhibition Leaking Times opens here tonight. She will be present at the opening event and on several occasions during the five weeks that the exhibition is on.,"She has ""moved"" her work studios - in Vienna's Westbahnstrasse and Fotolabor Berlin - to Cukrarna's Parter Gallery, where she will present her work and share her experience as artist and cultural workers with visitors.

For the duration of the show, she will be present to record, conceptualise and represent her work beyond the dichotomy of lived and measured time, according to Cukrarna.

She focuses on dialectics between the space and time of production of a work of art and the space and time of its presentation, eluding a chronological sequence of moments and creating a time capsule that follows its own timeline.

Thun works primarily in analogue photography. She was born in 1985 and raised in Poland, and earned her master's degrees at the academies of fine arts in Vienna and Krakow.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Upper chamber vetoes reintroduction of compulsory receipt acceptance,The National Council vetoed in a 20:8 vote on Thursday the reintroduction of a rule under which retail businesses are obliged to give out a receipt for goods or services provided and customers are required to accept it.,"The National Assembly confirmed changes to to the fiscal validation of receipts act, which include a EUR 40 fine for customers failing to have the receipt on them right after the purchase, last Thursday.

While the rule had already been in force from January 2016 to January 2022, for more than a year now businesses have been obliged to give the customer the receipt in paper or electronic form only if the customer requested this.

Finance Ministry State Secretary Tilen Božič has argued that the previous government's decision to give up ""an important element of effective tax collection"" had created ""wiggle room for the grey economy"". In some industries, the number of certified receipts had dropped significantly last year, by as much as a fifth compared to the pre-Covid year 2019.

The veto was meanwhile proposed by the members of the upper chamber's Council for the Economy, Crafts, Tourism and Finance and passed without a debate. The petitioners consider it unacceptable to shift the responsibility for receipts to the customer and do so with the threat of a fine.

Minister Boštjančič reiterated for the press today that he would have liked to see no need to reintroduce this obligation, but in practice there had been a significant drop in the number of receipts issued in some sectors.

""In the past, when the compulsory issue and acceptance of receipts was in place, this law acted as a preventive measure. Inspectors merely warned customers, no fines were ever imposed. This is the direction we intend to pursue after the adoption of this law,"" he added.

The reintroduction of the rule was also rejected in the lower chamber by the opposition last week, with Jožef Lenart of the Democrats (SDS) for instance arguing that the claim that more taxes will be collected in this way was not valid, as tax revenue was at a record level last year.","economy, business and finance"

At the signing, Šarec moreover underlined that, in the context of rapid developments in defence and security, it is increasingly important to strengthen cooperation between countries.

""With the signing of the agreement, we have established principles and procedures for expanding political-military cooperation between Slovenia and Cyprus,"" he added.

The bilateral talks also touched focus on the current security situation in the Western Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, the war in Ukraine, international operations and missions, and topical European issues.

Šarec pointed out that Slovenia supports a more ambitious and effective Common Security and Defence Policy. ""We believe that the EU has taken important steps to strengthen European defence capabilities and promote a safer and more resilient EU environment,"" he added.

The minister sees participation in operations and missions as a key part of contributing to international security and stabilisation efforts. He added that the Western Balkans remains a priority operational area for Slovenia, while Slovenia is also actively engaged in the Mediterranean, the Sahel and the Middle East.","unrest, conflicts and war"

Slovenia tops Euro 2024 qualifying group after win against San Marino,Slovenia defeated San Marino 4:0 (2:0) in the Euro 2024 qualifiers on Sunday to take the top position in qualifying group H alongside Denmark.,"The scoring opened in the 4th minute when Žan Vipotnik converted a pass from Žan Karničnik from inside the box. Karničnik was also the assist guy for the second goal in the 16th minute as Jan Mlakar scored from a similar position inside the box.

Slovenia were relaxed in the second quarter and had a clear field advantage. Sandi Lovrić scored in the 56th minute and Karničnik in the 67th.

Head coach Matjaž Kek was pleased with the performance and said the team had achieved what is set out to do. ""But now it's time for rock'n' roll,"" he said about the coming games.

""Slovenia is well placed as far as qualifying berths are concerned... We have a positive outlook heading into the new cycle.""

After six rounds of play Slovenia and Denmark have 13 points each, followed by Kazakhstan and Finland with 12. Northern Ireland has three and San Marino zero points.

The next games will be played in October, when Slovenia takes on Finland at home and Northern Ireland on the road.",sport
Slovenia out of Nations League final round in quarter-finals,"The Slovenian men's volleyball team is out of the final round of the Nations League, which is played in Poland's Gdansk, having conceded in Thursday's quarter-finals to Japan in straight sets. Japan, the second-ranked team in the preliminary round, played stifling defence to stop the main point of attack by Slovenia.","Slovenia, the runners-up from the last European championship, had the greatest chance of winning a set in the first session, in which they earned a game-high 24 points. They did not stand much chance in the other two sets.

Japan, on the other hand, had their superstar Yuki Ishikawa at their disposal in his finest form. He scored as many as 27 points, compared to 12 by Slovenia's best scorers Alen Pajenk and team captain Tine Urnaut.

After the defeat in Ergo Arena in front of some 1,500 spectators, Slovenia's head coach Gheorghe Cretu said that ""we tried, we fought hard, and had our opportunities. I think that we have done a good job in the [Nations] League. I'm proud of the lads.""

Urnaut added that ""Japan deservedly won, we were not better than them in any segment of the game. They had excellent serve reception, they were good in side-out, better in serve, we have to congratulate them.""

The captain admitted that the Slovenian team still lacked a lot and that it needed to work on its game a lot. ""We have to think about how to correct everything ... but first of all we need to get very well rested.""",sport
Mathematical physicist first Slovenian with two ERC advanced grants,"Mathematical physicist Tomaž Prosen, a professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, has won his second European Research Council(ERC) advanced grant for research in mathematical statistical physics.","In the project Quantum Ergodicity: Stability and Transitions (QUEST) Prosen will research the robustness of quantum chaos and quantum ergodicity for outside disruptions. As Prosen said, this is basic research in the field of mathematical statistical physics.

Ergodicity, which is the idea that a point of a moving system will eventually visit all the parts of the space that the system moves in, is one of the key characteristics of many-body systems (microscopic systems made of many interacting particles), but it is incredibly difficult to prove it mathematically, said Prosen.

His research team was able to identify one such solvable paradigm, called dual unitary quantum circuit.

In the last two to three years the dual unitary quantum circuits has become a hot topic of research since the circuits offer an ideal platform to test quantum computers, the faculty said.

As this is a special class of dynamic systems, a key question is how robust are the analytical mechanisms of ergodicity when faced with outside disruptions that destroy the structure and the ideal solvability of the system.

The main hypothesis of the project is that the dual unitary circuits have to be robust, said Prosen, adding that they are intuitively considering analogies from mathematics and chaos theory.

If the hypothesis can be proven at least partially, there are many interesting applications, such as the theory of condensed matter, quantum informatics, quantum field theory and quantum gravitational theory.

Prosen will receive EUR 2.17 million in ERC funding for the project. His first priority will be to assemble a research team.

In September the faculty will present the project and host a round-table on the importance of the ERC for research in Slovenia.

This is the 11th ERC project for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and the second for Prosen, who has previously led the project called Open Many-body Non-Equilibrium Systems.

The ERC advanced grant is one of the most prestigious and competitive EU research grants, awarded to established, leading researchers with a track record of important research achievements in the past decade.",education
Golob dismisses testimony by fmr. minister as insinuation,"Prime Minister Robert Golob has dismissed as ""a lot of insinuation"" testimony by Tatjana Bobnar, the former interior minister, who alleged in parliament yesterday that he tried to exert undue pressure on the police.","""There was a single truth and a lot of insinuation,"" he said, the only truth being that he had met her in May last year, before she was named minister, to agree with her that she had a single task of ""purging the police of Janšists.""

""She repeated this yesterday and this is the only truth she told. There are witnesses for everything else, it is not my word against hers, and these witnesses will confirm where she stretched the truth,"" he said.

Bobnar, who headed the Interior Ministry between June and December 2022, reiterated in parliament yesterday that she had been subjected to political pressure from Golob, which led to a public clash between them and eventually her resignation.

""Golob demanded from me ... actions that were inadmissible and unacceptable, as he directly interfered with staffing in the police,"" Bobnar said, adding that he had even demanded that a specific person lose their job for her to remain minister.

The testimony came at a session of a commission of inquiry which is investigating allegations of political pressure on the police during the terms of the current and previous government.

Golob is slated to testify as well. ""I have enough witnesses and sufficient evidence about how little truth Bobnar spoke yesterday. The same goes for Boštjan Lindav,"" he said about the former police commissioner, who also testified yesterday.","crime, law and justice"
Roglič takes the lead at Giro (adds),"Primož Roglič won the decisive penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia on Saturday to snatch the leader's jersey away from Briton Geraint Thomas, helped by massive support from Slovenian fans in the 18.6 km time trial up the Monte Lussari just across the border.","The 33-year Slovenian Jumbo-Visma rider beat Thomas, the Ineos Grenadiers rider, by 40 seconds to gain a 14-second advantage ahead of the final flat stage in Rome.

Despite incredible support from his fans, Roglič went through a drama on the brutally-steep track. After being fastest through all split times and when it seemed he can break Thomas, the chain on his bike fell off, he lost 20 seconds and he appeared to have lost the battle.

However, this appeared to have given him yet extra strength and he powered on with superhuman effort to show he is a stronger man than Thomas. Portuguese Joao Almeida came in third and the trio stand in the same order in the overall rankings.

""It's something amazing. It's not in the end about the win but about the people. The energy here is incredible. Moments to remember,"" Roglič said after the race, adding that the people gave him ""extra watts"".

This is the 73rd career stage win for Roglič, the reigning time trial Olympic champion, and his fourth at the Giro, and he is on course to become the first Slovenian to win this iconic Grand Tour race.

Looking at final, technical stage, he said the ""race is not over till it's finished, but it looks good"".",sport
Survey suggests children under 15 victims of prostitution in Slovenia,"A survey on child prostitution in Slovenia conducted by Ključ, an association that fights against trafficking in persons, has revealed that underage children, many of whom are under 15, can be victims of prostitution, especially girls who run away from juvenile correction centres.","While they are on the run, they are exposed to sexual abuse and probably prostitution in exchange for shelter, food and drugs, warned participants in a debate on the topic hosted by police, the Ljubljana Šiška social services centre and Ključ on Thursday.

In the autumn of 2022 Ključ conducted a survey among social workers, teachers and others who work with children to check how many of them encountered a potential victim of prostitution. The questionnaire was sent to 900 addresses and 351 came back answered, mostly from high schools, social centres and NGOs.

""About 10% of those surveyed or 36 persons detected the possibility that a child is involved in prostitution. Mostly they said these were children aged between 15 and 18, while many said they were under 15,"" said Ključ head Polona Kovač.

The total number of children for which experts suspect to be the victims of prostitution has been estimated to stand between 120 and 248.

The problem with the poll was that the names of potential victims were not revealed, so several persons might have reported the same victims.

Ključ warns that underage children are not included in the official records of victims of prostitution.

In Slovenia, prostitution is being conducted in private apartment, hired rooms, massage parlours, and night clubs, with the services advertised on specialised websites, said Anja Mrkalj Kastelic, a senior criminal inspector from the General Police Administration.

Irena Velič from the Ljubljana Šiška social services centre said girls running away from juvenile correction centres were particularly vulnerable. ""Usually these are persons from dysfunctional families who have severe emotional and behavioural problem,"" she said, adding that the Covid-19 epidemic added to their problems.

Highlighted as particularly worrying was that different girls name the same locations where prostitution is taking place. ""The girls tell me during informal talks that it is happening in hotels in Domžale and the Ljubljana InterContinental hotel,"" she said.

The head of the police force's juvenile delinquency unit, Robert Tekavec, confirmed that police were investigating suspicions of criminal acts where the victims are children and where different locations were mentioned. But he would not reveal any detail due to an ongoing investigation involving minors.

The management of the Ljubljana five-star hotel said it was extremely surprised and shocked by the information about alleged prostitution of underage children in the hotel of which it learned from the media. The hotel strongly distanced itself from the matter, noting it had not been informed of such activity by any of the relevant bodies or institutions.

""The hotel management strongly condemns such actions in line with our corporate policy and will actively cooperate in any kind of procedure ..."" InterContinental management said.

It added that guests provided their ID at the check-in but that the hotel had no authority to check the identity of other visitors or providers of services at the hotel.

""However, our staff is trained to recognise suspicious activities and respond promptly and accordingly, and call security or police if they notice anything suspicious. Based on today's information, the hotel management will pay even more attention to raising awareness and recognising suspicious activities,"" the hotel said.","crime, law and justice"
Italian Patrizia Raveggi wins literary translation award,The Association of Slovenian Literary Translators has conferred the Lavrin Diploma for 2023 on Italian translator Patrizia Raveggi for her superb translations and her efforts to promote Slovenian literature in Italy. She will receive the award at the ongoing Slovenian Book Days in Ljubljana.,"As an outstanding expert in the most diverse styles of language, Raveggi was praised by the jury for not shying away from the most demanding translation challenges.

She has translated a number of classical and contemporary works, from Fran Levstik and Ciril Kosmač to Vitomil Zupan, Dušan Šarotar, Katja Perat, Goran Vojnović, Tadej Golob and more, as well as many books for children and youth.

She has also written a number of essays on Slovenian literature and organised reading tours of Slovenian authors in Italy.

""The numerous and in-depth coverage of Raveggi's translations in the most prominent Italian daily newspapers, literary magazines and online media testify to the fact that Slovenian literature is increasingly being noticed and accepted by the Italian public, thanks to her work,"" the jury said.

After graduating in Italian literature and art history in Italy, Raveggi was an Italian language tutor at the Ljubljana Faculty of Arts for a number of years.

She has also served as an Italian culture diplomat and held several cultural offices, while she has become an established translator of Slovenian and English literature since the mid-1980s.

The Lavrin Diploma award was introduced in 2003 to promote quality translation of Slovenian literature as well as of books of humanities and social sciences.

It is named after Slovenian literary historian, translator and author Janko Lavrin (1887-1986), who was a member of PEN International and founder of the Slavic studies department at Nottingham University in the UK, where he taught Russian literature.",education
Paper notes hopes and doubts after Milatović's election,"Set to become the new president of Montenegro, Jakov Milatović seems to be good news for his country's EU and NATO accession efforts, says Delo, but the public should keep in mind his ties with the Serbian Orthodox Church. Milorad Dodik was also seen as a liberal politician at the start of his rise, the newspaper notes.","The fragmented opposition in Montenegro is happy that Milatović's win means that for the first time in more than 30 years the country has a new president as Milo Đukanović is defeated, but at the same time it is not sure whether or not to be happy with the former economy minister's ascent to power.

Currently, Milatović, with his pro-EU and pro-NATO rhetoric, is exciting news for all ""observers who, in good faith, would like to see Montenegro join the EU as soon as possible and break free from the pro-Russian Serbia's embrace.

""But at the same time not even careless observers could overlook the detail that Milatović enjoyed the support of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The new president, who sports a master's degree from Oxford and a career track record of exclusively foreign banks, starting with NLB, surely understands how the market of favours works.

""No lunch has ever been free, and after all, the Serbian Orthodox Church is not famous for forgetting that time it did someone a favour, and even less for letting them off from paying interest for these favours.""

It is because of this that a part of the Montenegrin public, seen as the nationalists in ""the Serbian world"", is restless with good reason, says Delo and then proceeds to tell a cautionary tale of Milorad Dodik, a Bosnian Serb politician who serves as the president of Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina and whom his supporters have nicknamed Mile.

At the start of his career, Dodik was considered a liberal, pro-EU, pro-NATO and pro-US politician, and it was this position that helped him enormously in his ascent to power in Republika Srpska. Dodik has long ago abandoned buttering up the West and is known for his anti-NATO and pro-Putin stance.

He also has strong ties with the Serbian Orthodox Church and is the best proof of what a pro-EU and forward-looking politician can become over the years in the Balkans.

Optimists in Bosnia-Herzegovina hopeful that the change in Montenegro will prompt new developments in Republika Srbska hope in vain, as Dodik's hold on power is significantly stronger than Đukanović's was, says the commentary Milo Is Gone, Mile Is Not Going Anywhere.",politics
Fmr money laundering tzar investigated for abuse of office (adds),"An investigation has been launched into suspected abuse of office by former director of the Office for Money Laundering Prevention Damjan Žugelj over a massive investigation reportedly connected to an alleged deal between the then PM Janez Janša and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, report news portals N1 and Necenzurirano.","The police and the state prosecution are investigating whether Žugelj violated the law, abused his office and the Office for Money Laundering Prevention in launching the extensive investigation, N1 says.

N1 reports on Saturday that a short anonymous letter, received by the Office for Money Laundering Prevention during the time of Slovenia's previous, Janša-led government, had triggered one of the most extensive investigations ever performed by the office.

In only three weeks, the office sent 238 demands to banks to look into 195 bank accounts, N1 says. ""I have never heard of such an extensive investigation by this office, especially based on an anonymous letter,"" the first director of the office, Klaudijo Stroligo, told N1.

Necenzurirano reported a while ago that Slovenia's then Prime Minister Janša had struck a deal with Serbian President Vučić before last year's general election.

Janša was allegedly interested in his then rival and now Prime Minister Robert Golob and the business of Gen-I, the company Golob headed a long time, in the Balkans, the portal said.

Vučić was allegedly interested in the transactions of Dragan Đilas, a Serbian opposition leader, and Dragan Šolak, the Serbian co-owner of United, the parent company of N1 and Telemach, among others.

Janša rejected for N1 the report about his alleged deal with Vučić as absurd insinuations.

Citing the charges against Žugelj and other documents, N1 says that the office had inspected the bank accounts of Šolak, his immediate and distant family, the accounts of his companies in Slovenia and the private bank accounts of all managers in these companies.

The office also looked into the bank account of Branko Čakarmiš, now the general director of media company Pro Plus, the owner of broadcasters POP TV and Kanal A, and then the broadcasters' programme director.

Čakarmiš's account was inspected because the anonymous letter mentions a company called ASPN, in which Čakarmiš was director and part owner for a while in 2006, N1 says.

Necenzurirano also says that a part of the large volume of documents amassed by the Office for Money Laundering Prevention during that investigation had gone missing.

Žugelj meanwhile told N1 that the anonymous letter was ""rather extensive and specific, and could be described as wistleblowing"".

N1 says that the Financial Administration (FURS), then led by Ivan Simič, a prominent supporter of Janša's, had joined the investigation. The two bodies sent criminal complaints to the police against more than ten companies and individuals in Slovenia and abroad. But the investigation could not confirm the suspicions raised in the complaints.

N1 says that one of the key leads investigated by Žugelj was cash flow of EUR 80 million Telemach received between 2007 and 2021. This turned out to be the proceeds of cash payments by subscribers who pay their bills at Telemach offices, where the payment is commission-free.

United group and its co-owner Šolak reacted to the report in the afternoon. ""It is unbelievable and alarming that such primitive abuse was even possible in an EU member state in 2022,"" N1 reported Šolak as saying in a written statement.

""As someone who loves Slovenia and whose immediate family members are Slovenian, I sincerely hope that the state systems will show that the rule of law exists in Slovenia and that those responsible will be appropriately sanctioned,"" said Šolak.

The United group called on the relevant institutions to investigate whether ""illegal methods unbecoming of a democracy have been used against us, and to find who is responsible"", according to N1.

The media group also expects the relevant institutions to inform it whether data about its companies and its employees had been abused, where the documents are stored and whether all data has been appropriately protected. The group also expects a clear answer as to whether the investigation entailed political abuse of institutions.","crime, law and justice"
TEŠ generator undergoing scheduled overhaul,"The newest generator of the TEŠ thermal electric power plant will be wound down on Saturday for scheduled maintenance. The generator, notorious for high construction cost, will be reconnected to the grid in mid-May, TEŠ said in a press release on Wednesday.","During this period, the electricity and heat will be provided by the plant's gas turbine. The scheduled overhaul will entail hardware and software updates, and maintenance works.

This year by 19 April, TEŠ produced 697 gigawatt hours of electricity, amounting to 26% of the electricity produced in Slovenia, the company said.

The generator, known widely as TEŠ6, has been disconnected from the grid several times in the past year, most recently in March to repair an evaporator leak.

A year ago, it was wound down for scheduled repairs and in autumn the generator was disconnected to save coal, as coal prices were expected to skyrocket.",weather
"Volunteers plant 6,000 trees to help forests recover from calamity (adds)","Volunteers planted some 6,000 saplings of trees in five locations around the country as part of the annual reforestation campaign on Saturday. Prime Minister Robert Golob joined them in Kras in the west, hopeful nature in the region will recover from the devastation caused by the worst wildfire on record last year.","Organised by the state-owned forestry company SiDG, the Rejuvenate Forests campaign is being held for the fourth year running in locations where forests were affected by natural disasters or bark beetle.

Volunteers planted around 6,000 seedlings of native species of oak, cherry, fir, larch, larch, Douglas fir, chestnut, sycamore, beech and sessile oak in the Kočevje region in the south, the Pohorje hills in the north-east, the Bohor area in the east, the Medvode area in central Slovenia and in Kras.

In the north-western part of Kras, 300 saplings were planted in a 2.5 hectare area along with 24 kilogrammes of seeds of the Montpellier maple, field maple, common lime and small-leaved lime, which are species native to the region.

Golob, who comes from the Nova Gorica area nearby, hailed the campaign and voluntarism as one of the ways in which everyone can help nature. He believes people from all over Slovenia will visit the region throughout the year to show their regard for nature and forests.

""Last summer, after the fire, it looked terrible, but now in spring when it's all budding, there's hope that the damage from the huge fire may be not as bad as it seemed last year and that nature will recover,"" he said.

""It's our duty to help it to do so, and to try to plant new seeds and trees where the fire caused the worst devastation, so that Kras can recover as quickly as possible.""

He announced procurement of aircraft and other firefighting equipment.

SiDG director Marko Matjašič was happy with the turnout. He told the STA about 600 volunteers joined in, including about 200 in the Kras area.

The reforestation conditions in Kras are quite tough; ""we're planting virtually among rocks and are looking forward to every success in the long run"".

Volunteers of all ages joined in, including many primary school children and members of various organisations such as scouts, as well as the Forest Service.

The annual campaign aims to spread awareness of the importance of forests. ""We all wish for a quality forest in the long term and we are determined to repeat the campaign every year,"" said Matjašič.",environmental issue
Survey shows majority in favour of abolition of top-up insurance,"A recent survey commissioned by the newspaper Dnevnik suggests that nearly 65% of Slovenians support the abolition of top-up health insurance in favour of the new EUR 35 mandatory contribution per month. Some 25% of participants are not in favour of this move, and more than 10% are undecided.","The survey results are not a surprise due to the unpopularity of top-up health insurance, and were likely affected by the announced hike in a monthly premium of top-up health insurance, a decision by one of the three private insurers that set in motion the government's push for the abolition, Dnevnik said.

Looking at voters of different political parties, the survey shows that the supporters of the Left are most in favour of the abolition as all of them who participated in the poll expressed their support for this move.

When it comes to the supporters of the ruling party Freedom Movement, which tabled the legislation to abolish top-up insurance, 81% of them support this, according to the survey, and judging by the results, the share among the supporters of the Social Democrats (SD) seems to be 67%.

But even among the supporters of opposition parties there seems to be quite a lot of support for the proposal, as 42% of Democrats (SDS) supporters participating in the survey are in favour of it and 43% of New Slovenia- or NSi-voting participants.

Not in favour of the move are 49% of SDS-voting participants and 30% of NSi-voting participants.

The Freedom Movement's proposal, which enjoys the support of the other two coalition parties, have been criticised by both the SDS and the NSi.

The proposal would take the three private insurers out of the equation, as the funds would no longer be collected by them but by the ZZZS public health insurer.

The survey was carried out by Ninamedia between 13 and 14 April among 801 adults.",health

Trieste-based minority choir honoured for its efforts,"The Trieste-based Partisan Choir Pinko Tomažič, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, has been honoured for its contribution to community-strengthening efforts in the Slovenian minority in Italy, the Office for Slovenians Abroad said.","Minister for Slovenians Abroad Matej Arčon awarded the choir a special recognition at a May Day celebration in San Floriano del Collio on Monday in honour of the role the choir plays in the efforts to make sure the minority is a close-knit community and to foster its ties with the homeland.

Moreover, the choir has been honoured for preserving and strengthening Slovenian culture abroad, and for promoting the ideals of peace, brotherhood, harmony and equality between nations, reads the press release.

The minority's sense of community, respect for traditions and customs, and awareness of the meaning and message of public holidays set an example for the homeland, the minister told the event.

He said that ""we must not forget that volunteering, which keeps choirs, orchestras, drama groups, and sports and tourist organisations up and running is also work"".

Last week, the choir, led by Pia Cah, celebrated its 50th birthday with a concert performed on Day of Uprising Against Occupation.

Founded in Basovizza at the end of 1972, the choir was the brainchild of WWII veteran resistance fighters or Partisans. Its primary aim is to spread awareness about the legacy of Slovenia's resistance during the Second World War and keep Partisan songs alive, but it is also an organisation that strives to strengthen the minority's identity and promote Slovenian culture.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Ministries commit to taking on overcrowded closed wards of psychiatric facilities,The ministries responsible for the field committed as part a meeting at the Supreme Court on Tuesday to immediately start addressing the continuing acute shortage of space and staff at the closed wards of long-stay psychiatric facilities in the country.,"The meeting was initiated by Supreme Court president Miodrag Đorđević as the latest in a string of efforts and decisions by the judiciary that began in 2016. They have included the Constitutional Court ruling in 2019 in a complaint regarding the conditions in a closed ward facility that the current law on mental health is at odds with the constitution and that adequate capacities need to be secured without further ado.

Secure wards however remain overcrowded and and there are still no specialised wards for seriously perilous individuals and for children.

In addition, due to overcrowding and inadequate conditions, institutions are refusing to admit the most dangerous patients, which poses an extreme problem for the courts, as judges have nowhere to put people who would best be cared for in secure wards, the Supreme Court said in a press release.

In line with a Supreme Court decision from 2019 that is also being followed by other courts, individuals that cannot be accommodated at long-stay facilities are being being sent back temporarily to psychiatric hospitals.

""However, this is constitutionally inadmissible because it means that there is less space in hospitals for people who need acute inpatient psychiatric treatment,"" the court added.

The meeting was attended by Minister of Labour, Family, and Social Affairs Luka Mesec, Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan, Deputy Human Rights Ombudsman Ivan Šelih and representatives of the ministries for a solidarity-based future and for health. They agreed that the acute issue needed to be solved as soon as possible and committed to introducing concrete measures.","crime, law and justice"
Fiscal Council: Floods immense macroeconomic and fiscal shock,"The floods that hit Slovenia in early August are a natural disaster whose proportions represent an immense macroeconomic and fiscal shock, the Fiscal Council said on Friday as it assessed the government's plans on financing the post-flood reconstruction and aid to flood victims.","The guardian of public finances says that the revised 2023 budget the government has adopted is the first step in financing the reconstruction with budgetary funds.

It thus expects the floods to have a much bigger impact on the budgets for 2024 and 2025, which the government will be finalising in the autumn.

The council says that the two coming budgets should already contain the assessment of damage and of effects of the planned government measures.

In the revised budget for 2023, EUR 520 million has been allocated to eliminate the consequences of the floods and help the victims.

Of this, EUR 200 million will come from reservations for emergency aid for natural disasters, and this rise in expenditure does not change the council's spring assessment of the government's fiscal policy and its compliance with fiscal rules.

The remaining EUR 300 million that will go for post-flood reconstruction has been repurposed from funds for potential recapitalisations of energy companies.

The council says the impact of this change on public finances, the general government's debt and on compliance with fiscal rules cannot be assessed yet.

The council says it has been regularly drawing attention to poor budgeting, to not assessing the impact of certain measures sufficiently, to systematic underestimation or overestimation of certain sources of revenue or expenditures, among others.

To ensure a greater degree of transparency, all this will be very important as the government engages in budgeting in the future, especially if it sets up a special fund outside the national budget to finance the post-flood reconstruction.

The council believes that, to ensure more stable and sustainable public finances, the floods should serve as an additional impetus to include risk analysis into medium-term budgeting to a greater degree, which is also a recommendation of international institutions.

Such an analysis would probably show that Slovenia should establish a special budgetary fund for natural disasters, given its small size, geographic features and a frequent occurrence of natural disasters.

The government should also enhance efforts to make the private sector more aware of the need to insure one's property to limit ""moral hazard"", as the country will probably not be able to count on as robust EU funds in the coming decades as it can now.

The council urges spending public money on emergency measures prudently and efficiently. It also calls for addressing in future budgets the challenges ""that remained unaddressed before the natural disaster"", as procrastination affects the sustainability of public finances in the medium term.",disaster and accident
Patients to strike for public healthcare,"Rallies will be held in almost a dozen towns around the country as part of what a civil initiative has termed a patients' strike to demand access to a named GP for all, the abolishment of top-up health insurance, and putting an end to what they see as public money flowing into the hands of private health providers.","Jaša Jenull, a Voice of the People representative, says the strike is not directed against the government, it aims to preserve the public health system.

He urged systemic change to strengthen the public health system to take into account the needs and wishes of patients rather than lobbies, profiteers and privatisers.

The civil initiative has urged citizens to take part in the rallies, or at least support the strike by wearing two patches crossed on the chest.

Protesters in Ljubljana will gather at 5pm in the square opposite the National Assembly.

They will be addressed by several speakers, including Dušan Keber, a doctor who served as health minister in 2000-2004, while some patients will share their stories.

Support for the patients' strike has been expressed by nurses, and two confederations of trade unions, ZSSS and KSJS.

Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan was initially critical of it as another strike is looming, that of the powerful Fides trade union of doctors a day after this one.

He said last week that any strike or urging people to take to the streets was extremism, a statement he somewhat played down later on.

And as Voice of the People presented its demands to coalition MPs yesterday, all three coalition parties supported the action.

What is more, the Left said it will attend the rally, and so will Prime Minister Robert Golob to listen to the presentation of the demands.

Considering the people's strike as a way of highlighting the neglected rights of patients and the urgent need for change, he said health reform ""is the first and most important reform of this government"", so he welcomed all efforts in this direction even if expressed in a bid odd manner.

""Changes in such an important system can only happen when we build the broadest social consensus around it,"" Golob said.

Held on the eve of the doctors' strike, which the government still hopes to avert, the patients' strike comes as some 130,000 people in Slovenia do not have their named GP, while the Health Ministry is trying to cut wait times, plan a health reform and enter talks to set up a separate pay tier for doctors within the single public sector system after it reached a pay rise deal with health trade unions, except Fides.",health
NGO to collect signatures to legalise assisted suicide,"Silver Thread, an association campaigning for dignified old age, will be collecting 5,000 signatures to submit a bill on assisted suicide to the National Assembly. The organisation has requested a 6-month period to collect the signatures. The bill includes safeguards to prevent abuse, the NGO said.","Current legislation does not regulate the situation of those who are dying in suffering because neither medicine nor palliative care can help, said Andrej Pleterski, one of the authors of the bill, at a press conference on Tuesday. He sees assisted suicide as a solution to end the suffering of those in pain.

Adults with permanent residence in Slovenia and mandatory health insurance would be entitled to assisted death under this proposal, provided they experience unbearable suffering and have no hope of improving their health condition.

The proposal would not make it possible to resort to assisted death in case of life weariness, depression or without physiological reasons for suffering.

A special commission would write a prescription for the lethal substance and authorise a medical worker to collect it from the pharmacy and bring to the patient. The proposal would have the person inject the substance themselves as euthanasia would only be allowed as an exception.

This proposal guarantees the highest degree of protection against abuse or mistakes, said law expert Luka Mišič. The proposal sets strict conditions that the decision on assisted suicide can only be made after all other options for treatment have been considered and after consultations with the GP, a psychiatrist and other experts.

The bill does not aim to replace the poor palliative care in Slovenia, said Brigita Skele Savič, a health management expert, adding that it focuses on the autonomy of life and death decisions in a terminally ill person.

A Slovenian public opinion survey showed that 60% of respondents in 2009 saw euthanasia as acceptable, while the figure grew to 75% in 2022, said Pleterski. A survey by Ninamedia in May of 2022 showed similar results with 76.5% of respondents supporting the legalisation of assisted suicide, regardless of gender, age, education and place of residence and only affected by political and world views in a minor way.

Medical organisations have not consented to the proposal but Silver Thread is sensing that the younger generation of doctors and the doctors working closely with the dying are more favourable to the proposal. A conscientious objection will of course be possible, Pleterski said.

Among the parliamentary parties only the Left expressed its support for the proposal.

The other two ruling coalition parties, the Freedom Movement and the Social Democrats, as well as the opposition party New Slovenia find the substance of extremely sensitive nature. They called for an in-depth discussion.

The NSi described the topic as divisive and disturbing to society. They instead propose focusing on improving and enhancing palliative care.",social issue
"Except for poultry, fewer livestock animals slaughtered in 2022","The number of slaughtered livestock animals dropped in 2022, while the opposite is true for poultry, the Statistics Office (SURS) said. Compared to the previous year, the number of cattle slaughtered decreased by 1%, pigs by 13%, sheep by 5% and goats by 8%, while the figure for poultry increased by 4%.","Data shows that roughly 123,000 cattle, 270,000 pigs, 93,000 sheep, 23,000 goats and 41,64 million poultry animals were slaughtered in Slovenia last year.

In annual comparison, fewer animals were also slaughtered at family farms. Some 41,000 pigs were slaughtered at farms, a 39% drop over the year before, 22,000 sheep, a 9% drop, 258,000 poultry animals, a drop of 7%, and 81,000 sheep, down 6%.

As regards the number of pigs slaughtered, both in slaughterhouses and elsewhere, there was an overall decrease of 13%.

Most sheep (87%) and goat (96%) slaughter took place at farms, while 99% of poultry slaughter took place in abattoirs. The slaughtering of cattle is carried out entirely in slaughterhouses, according to SURS.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Govt with EUR 847m proposal for public sector wage reform,"The government presented to the public sector unions on Monday a new proposal for the elimination of wage disparities in the sector and adjustment of jobs to a new wage scale, worth around EUR 847 million. Although the unions have some reservations, the government thinks that 15 October is a realistic date to conclude the talks.","As Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik noted after today's round of talks, the EUR 847 million did not include the wages of officials and directors.

The entire upgrade of the wage system, including the elimination of disparities, is estimated at approximately EUR 1 billion.

""Since this is a large amount, it is clear, and it was clear also at the beginning of this year, that it will not be possible to make this upgrade immediately,"" the minister said.

The plan is to carry out the entire reform in three years, with the specifics and the pace to be agreed on in the negotiations with the trade unions.

The minister explained that the elimination of wage disparities actually meant that the wages of all civil servants would increase, with those who currently had the lowest wages gaining the most with the transition to the new wage system.

The first bracket on the new scale will be valued in the amount of the minimum wage, and those who are currently in the 25th bracket will get a 25% increase, while those ranked below the 25th wage even slightly more, the minister added.

She noted that the government was in no way withdrawing from upgrading the wage system, as it had only proposed that the start of the implementation of the reform be postponed for a year, to 1 January 2025, due to the flood recovery efforts.

Ajanović Hovnik assessed that the talks were ""approaching the final act"", although quite a few difficult questions remained open. It is nevertheless realistic that the talks conclude by 15 October, which is the government's wish, she added.

The unions expressed certain concerns, with Jakob Počivavšek, who heads a part of the negotiating group on their side, saying that one of the key problems was that adjustment of wage brackets during the implementation of the reform was not envisaged.

If the minimum wage is raised, the first wage bracket would be significantly below the minimum wage by the time the reform is implemented, he said.

Irena Ilešič Čujovič of the KSJS trade union said that, with the anticipated inflation and higher costs of living and other factors, the ""freezing of an escalating wage scale"" would actually mean that ""the wage reform would pay for itself"".

She also noted that the government's proposal was similar to the increase in 2018, which expanded the disparities between jobs and wages in the public sector.

She also finds disputable the effect on titles in education, culture, science and social security. ""The effect obtained based on professional criteria is in fact decreasing, and we wonder whether this is one of the foundations of this wage reform.""",labour
Postojna Cave launches project to protect baby dragons,"Last year's olm offspring at the Postojna Cave inspired a new project to raise funds for the protection of the cave species and its natural habitat, and to conduct further research into what is considered part of Slovenia's living heritage.","In 2022, the Postojna Cave vivarium welcomed 36 baby olms, snake-like and almost translucent blind animals endemic to the Dinaric karst, which is only their second batch in history. The animals can live up to 120 years.

""It is this eternal youth that pushes science to conduct research, but the olm has always been a symbol of our natural heritage as well,"" Marjan Batagelj, the CEO of Postojna Cave operator, told the press yesterday.

The Protect Proteus project was launched with the principal aim of protecting the olm and raising public awareness of how important this underground amphibian is. One of the goals is also to raise awareness of keeping the environment and drinking water clean as this is one of the prerequisites to preserve the olm.

""Nature has entrusted us with protecting baby dragons so our mission in to ensure a safe and healthy living environment for the species,"" Batagelj noted.

The preservation effort will be funded with the sale of special wristbands. The funds will then be allocated to ensuring optimal living conditions for the olm, educating the public, and long-term investments into environmental protection. People will also be able to make separate donations towards the project.

Specialized laboratories are to be set up where data on the olm and other cave species will be gathered.

Part of the money will be secured from corporate partners committed to sustainability. The project will also involve the Ljubljana Faculty of Biotechnology, with which the Postojna Cave has signed a cooperation agreement.",environmental issue
President highlights Germany ties at Frankfurt Book Fair opening (adds),"The 75th Frankfurt Book Fair opened Thursday evening with Slovenia as the guest of honour. Addressing the ceremony, President Nataša Pirc Musar underlined the ties between the Slovenian and German nations in language and books.","Pirc Musar said that books were at the very centre of cultural consciousness of the Slovenian people. ""Our identity is built on the Slovenian language, which to us is closely linked to books in our cultural consciousness,"" she said, underlining the importance of the first printed book in the Slovenian language.

The author, Protestant priest Primož Trubar, ""first addresses us as Slovenians"", establishing a connection that still holds true today: ""Slovenians are a community determined by its language more so than by the borders of a territory,"" said Pric Musar.

Literature is the most authentic expression of the Slovenian character, history and soul, she said, adding that this was why Slovenia appreciated Slovenian literary authors without regard for whether they work in Slovenia or beyond the country's borders.

Slovenia is honoured to be the guest of honour and proud that many authors had found publishers abroad and that their books had filled the shelves of the country's pavilion at the fair, the president said, listing a number of impactful authors, among them Drago Jančar, Slavoj Žižek, Erica Johnson Debeljak, Alma Karlin, Maja Haderlap and Boris Pahor.

The latter conveyed a significant message in his novel Necropolis that dictatorships, not nations, must be condemned, said Pirc Musar, pointing to the many conflicts around the world and condemning the ""carnage perpetrated by the terrorist organisation Hamas"".

But ""what we see in Gaza is an assault in human dignity as well,"" said the president, adding that she was worried about the scenario that was coming true. She called for an end to violence and implementation of humanitarian law and human rights.

The president noted that Slovenia's pavilion features a large number of poets and is dedicated to printed books. ""A cacophony of audio, visual and textual contents of the digital age often leads to superficial and scattered reading. But reading and understanding are not the same!""

This is the reason why the Ljubljana Manifesto on higher-level reading for the development of analytical and critical thinking was created just before the Frankfurt Book Fair, the president said.

The roots of the Frankfurt Book fair go back centuries, with the president noting that Slovenian language was first present here over 400 years ago, when a four-way German-Italian-Latin-Slovenian dictionary was first mentioned in a fair catalogue in 1592.

She noted the connections between the Slovenian and German nations. While Germany is a top trade partner for Slovenia today, most notably in automotive industries, pharmacy and machine building. But ties also extend to books and the beginnings of printing. Among other things, the first printed book in Slovenian was printed in Germany, she noted.

The ceremony was also addressed by the poet Miljana Cunta, who talked about poetry making, and by philosopher Žižek, who explored the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his contribution.

He said that there will be no solution for Gaza without books and quoted the historian Yuval Noah Harari that Israel is on its way to become a dictatorship. Palestinians are viewed as the problem, but a look should also be taken at their situation, he said, earning criticism from the audience that he was relativising the problem, which Žižek vehemently rejected.

He believes that people can comprehend the situation only through book reading. Terrorism against Israel goes against all the values of the Frankfurt Book Fair. But the decision to postpone the award ceremony for the Palestinian author Adania Shibli goes against the fair's values as well.

Slovenia's appearance in Frankfurt, running until 22 October, will feature a total of about 250 events, both at the fair and in the city. The most widely translated Slovenian authors will be showcased at special installations at the Slovenian pavilion with an additional spotlight on architect Jože Plečnik (1872-1957) and Trieste-based author Boris Pahor (1913-2022).

Spanning 2,400 square metres, the Slovenian pavilion is designed with bookshelves in the form of beehives to reflect the slogan of the presentation, the Honeycomb of Words.

The biggest event hosted by Slovenia will be a concert by the industrial band Laibach at the Jahrhunderthalle on Thursday. Another major event will be a meeting between the Ljubljana and Frankfurt schools of philosophy at Goethe University on Friday featuring Žižek, Mladen Dolar and Alenka Zupančič from Slovenia and Rainer Forst and Martin Saar from Germany. They will offer their critical takes on ideology.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Bill granting amnesty for breach of Covid rules passed in re-vote,"The National Assembly passed in a 50:33 vote on Wednesday a bill granting amnesty for fines people received for breach of Covid rules during the pandemic, in what was a re-vote after the upper chamber vetoed it at the end of September.","Amnesty for Covid fines had been one of the main pledges by the government when it took office last year, but it took months before the legislation was hashed out.

The bill was vetoed after it had been originally passed in a 49:20 vote in late September, with the largest opposition party maintaining that it would only lead to new injustices.

During the debate at the National Council, councillor Miloš Pohole said that the individuals to be reimbursed had violated the law that was in force during the pandemic, with the potential consequence of this being the loss of life and health of a large number of people.

He also noted that the solutions adopted now constituted a violation of the rule of law and set a bad example for the future.

The law will also place a burden on the Slovenian judiciary and taxpayers, with the total estimated financial impact of the law amounting to over EUR 5 million, Pohole stressed.

The coalition, on the other hand, considers the bill a step to right wrongs, as it provides for the reimbursement of fines imposed in proceedings initiated during the previous government's term on grounds that were later found to be unconstitutional.

Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan maintains that the legislation was aimed at regaining people's trust in the rule of law.

Crises and extraordinary circumstances cannot be an excuse for trampling and excessive encroachment on human rights, the minister told the MPs today, adding that she was bothered by ""people being disciplined by means of misdemeanour law"".

This resulted in people failing to understand the measures as correct, necessary or useful, but only as a form of forced repression, she added.

The opposition meanwhile believes that the bill is unnecessary and that it undermines the principles of the rule of law. Democrats (SDS) MP Branko Grims said it was a dangerous precedent, as it meant that any government can retroactively revoke all procedures.

New Slovenia (NSi) said the bill interfered with open misdemeanour or court proceedings, which could trigger an avalanche of new requests of the same kind.

If a fine for misdemeanour is issued in violation of regulations, legislation allows the alleged perpetrator to contest it themselves, said MP Vida Čadonič Špelič, who feels that the bill had been proposed only because the fines had been issued during the previous, SDS-led government.","crime, law and justice"
Balkan religious leaders urge joint efforts to overcome differences,"A two-day meeting of religious leaders from the Balkans started in Koper on Saturday. Addressing the meeting, which is hosted by the Slovenian Catholic Church, President Nataša Pirc Musar called on the religious leaders to help overcome differences in the region. The participants expressed support for the region's EU prospects.","The meeting is hosted by the Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK) in cooperation with the Diocese of Koper.

Launching the Forum for Dialogue and Peace in the Balkans, the main segment of the meeting, SŠK president Andrej Saje said that in addition to the international community the commitment to peace in modern society involved other social entities too, in particular the Christian churches and other religions, as well as individuals.

""We are co-responsible for life on this planet, through small and everyday actions we are fellow workers in building peace,"" he said.

The commitment to peace is possible only through sincere dialogue and the ability to listen, Saje said, urging the forum to be an example of dialogue, listening, accepting differences and cooperation, ""so that we reduce divisions and conflicts and contribute to efforts to build peace and a better world"".

Also addressing the forum, President Pirc Musar said that due to acute political instability in the Western Balkans, crimes that took place in the region, and the rollback of democracy ""we witness everywhere today"", the timing of the meeting could not be more appropriate. The question of how to move forward is more pressing than ever, she added.

She stressed the need to continue with EU accession efforts in the region. ""I would like to see leaders in the region realise that they will be stronger if they are part of European integration, and that sometimes things have to be given up for this.

""Every candidate country, including Slovenia, has been tested in this way. The fact that we had to make certain compromises in moving towards the EU has paid off in many ways. In every respect, Slovenia is infinitely richer today than when it was not a member state,"" she said.

Aware that the region still faces many challenges, the president pointed to divisions and exclusion, including on the grounds of religion. She therefore called on the religious leaders to help overcome divisions in the region.

""If anyone, it is you, who can take a big, even decisive step towards cooperation, mutual understanding, the elimination of divisions and the acceptance of difference [...] You too are called to help the entire region move towards a path of forgiveness, acceptance of diversity, and an inclusive future.""

The forum is also attended by Prime Minister Robert Golob and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, who is taking part in the event as a delegate of Pope Francis.

The Balkan region was once called a powder keg, Parolin said, but at the same time there have been ""many remarkable examples of harmonious coexistence between members of different nationalities, cultures and faiths in the region"".

Nevertheless, challenges remain, including constant efforts to invest in a culture of encounter ""to avoid a culture of confrontation"", he said, highlighting dialogue as an important aspect ""that is essential in the current era of globalisation"".

Parolin also stressed the importance of interfaith dialogue, which Pope Francis also believes is ""an essential prerequisite for peace"". Interfaith dialogue is the duty of all believers and religious leaders, he added.

The Vatican's secretary of state sees efforts to move towards EU membership as one of the solutions to maintain peace in the region, and such efforts are supported by the Holy See.

The meeting in the coastal town of Koper is one of the most important religious events in Slovenia and the wider region this year.

It is attended by the leaders of the Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Muslim and Jewish communities from the region. In their addresses, they all stressed the need and their own responsibility for dialogue and constant active efforts to overcome differences. The challenges are many, but they are not insurmountable, they said.

At the end of the three-hours forum, the participants adopted a special resolution noting that peace is their common goal and calling on all individuals, especially those in positions of leadership, to promote and work for it.

They stress that extremism, terrorism and all other forms of violence and war have nothing to do with genuine religion, and must be rejected both in society as well as at the level of religious communities.

They note the need for regular meetings and efforts to seek joint solutions between the various religious communities in the Balkan region, where, due to their historical and current influence, the Catholic and Orthodox churches and the Islamic community have a particular responsibility.

What will follow in the afternoon is a Youth for Peace cultural meeting, and in the evening a gala organ concert will be held at the Koper cathedral.

Cardinal Parolin, who is scheduled to meet Pirc Musar and Golob this afternoon, will say mass in the cathedral tomorrow.",religion and belief
Freedom Movement highlights support measures for pensioners,The senior coalition Freedom Movement confirmed on Wednesday that pensions will rise by about 5% in line with the annual adjustment to be decided on by the ZPIZ public pension fund on Thursday. The party moreover pointed to a number of measures adopted in recent months in order to support this vulnerable group.,"The Freedom Movement wrote in a press release that all households have benefited from systemic measures against the rising costs of living, which targeted energy prices, including with an energy allowance that had pensioners among the beneficiaries.

As the high inflation also called for higher income, parliament adopted in November emergency legislation that led to 4.5% higher pensions in November and December, and limited care fees in nursing homes.

The party added that changes to the long-term act adopted by the previous government had also been important to protect the elderly. It said that without the changes, 30% of present users of long-term care services would no longer be eligible for them.

The press release from the Freedom Movement comes ahead of Thursday's ZPIZ session that will determine the exact pension adjustment. ZPIZ's financial plan envisaged a 4.9% adjustment.

On Tuesday the Slovenian Pensioners' Trade Union highlighted major issues related the high inflation, in particular food prices, and called for the regular adjustment to be topped by two more, to the tune of 1% and 4.4%.

In January, ZDUS, the national umbrella organisation of pensioners, called for a regular adjustment of 7.1% and thousands of protesters gathered in the centre of Ljubljana to demand decent pensions.",social issue

Salt production below average this year,"Production of salt is significantly below the long-term average this year as the Sečovlje salt pans produced 644 tonnes of salt in 2023, director Klavdij Godnič told the STA. The Sečovlje nature park has seen more than 35,000 visitors this year.","In 2022, when conditions were better as it was dry and hot, the Sečovlje salt pans were able to produce 1,750 tonnes of salt.

This year's below average yield is a result of poor weather conditions and abundant rain. Still, the quality of this year's salt is very good, the director noted.

Because of rain, the salt production season ended before September.

After the season ended, the routine maintenance began as well as repairs in the evaporation areas, including the mechanical construction of embankments and the manual installation of sluice gates. This year they are also restoring one of the water supply channels with the renovation expected to be completed in 2025.

The Sečovlje nature park has this year welcomed more than 35,000 visitors, which is a similar figure as in 2022 and in the years before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The salt pans are managed by Soline Pridobivanje Soli, which just saw its contract extended by ten years until July 2033.",weather

Days of Gottscheer Culture start in Semič,"Days of Gottscheer Culture will kick off on Friday evening in Semič, south-east. The three-day series of events aim to preserve the heritage of the Gottscheer Germans or Kočevarji, who lived in the area of Kočevje in the south of Slovenia until the end of the Second World War.","On Friday a discussion will be held with two of the few direct descendants of the Gottscheer Germans that still speak the Gottschee language, the organisers noted. A folk dance group of the Association of Gottschee Native Inhabitants will perform.

On Saturday the festival will continue with a 12-kilometre hike through what used to be Gottscheer villages.

A workshop will be held to showcase traditional farming activities on Sunday. A fine-arts colony will be organised on Mirna Gora hill, where typical Gottscheer dishes will be served.

As part of the festival, two exhibitions will be on display in Semič, one on bee-keeping in the area, and the other featuring paintings of a 2022 fine arts colony, organised by the Semič Association of Fine Artists and the Union of Gottschee Organisations.

The Germans settled in the area of Kočevje in the 14th century. In 1870, some 26,500 Gottscheers lived in the region. They mostly resettled due to the 1930s recession and repatriation efforts by the Nazis during WWII.

Today some 600-700 direct descendants of Gottscheers still live in Slovenia, according to data of the Union of Gottschee Organisations.

Their numbers are decreasing, which is why the municipalities of Semič, Dolenjske Toplice and Kočevje have joined forces and alternate in hosting the Days of Gottscheer Culture.","arts, culture and entertainment"

Goodyear Slovenia completes EUR 94m investment in expansion,The Kranj-based tyre maker Goodyear Slovenija has announced that it has increased production capacity by 25% and created 160 jobs as part of a EUR 94 million investment project that started in January 2019 and was completed last month.,"The first phase of the investment was completed in 2019, while the second started in 2020 and was supposed to end by start of 2022.

The Covid-19 pandemic and longer wait times for all the permits meant that the end date had to be postponed, Goodyear has told the STA. The project ended last month when the last operating permit was issued.

Two new buildings were added to the existing building complex in Kranj where advanced equipment for production of tyres was set up. The equipment reduces the amount of physical labour needed but creates a greater demand for skilled workers, such as machine operators, maintenance workers and engineers.

Since 2015 an increased demand has been recorded in the European market for large-wheeled cars, such as premium SUV and electric cars. Goodyear will be able to keep up with the demand thanks to the investment that increased the production capacity of passenger tyres of larger dimensions by up to 1.8 million units per year.

Goodyear Slovenija, which currently employs some 1,700 people, is one of the leading tyre manufacturers in South-east Europe, has been part of the Goodyear multinational since 1998. It produces and sells tyres for passenger cars, light and heavy cargo vehicles, industrial and construction machinery and motorcycles.

Finance slams working hours tracking law as a step back,"The newspaper Finance sees the new legislation passed last week that requires of companies to keep detailed records of working hours as yet another ""bureaucratic nuisance"" that will impact many small and medium-sized companies. It criticises the government for opting to hit all companies instead of punishing just those who abuse worker rights.","The paper notes that the new rules will not change much for large companies, which already track working hours electronically, but they will for the average entrepreneur who employs a few (dozen) people, and for companies employing more skilled staff.

As an example it offers a financial consultant whose workday often extends to 12 hours at the end of business year when financial statements are filed, but who is virtually free from June to September.

The Labour Ministry says it is important for all categories of workers that working time rules be observed. ""Will the new solution make it easier for a labour inspector to catch a financial expert with above average pay who works up to 12 hours a day a few weeks in a year?

""What if we'd rather gone after the bosses of overworked construction workers - mostly foreigners who do not know their rights well and work for 12 hours and more a day for a minimum wage and without getting paid for overtime? Or a restaurateur who due to a shortage of staff pressures his employees to work whole days, weekends and holidays during the peak season, which does not reflect in their pay?

""By backing the law, the coalition decided to hit everyone. Even for instance a marketing agency director who comes up with a good idea for a campaign while having a beer with his friends, and back home he will develop that idea for an hour longer...""

""Instead of staffing up the inspectorate, focusing on the most problematic sectors and going after serious violators, the whole economy will face an additional burden. The new obligation of issuing of a written notice on used working time that the employer will have to give to the employee along with the pay slip will cost EUR 259,432 a month by the ministry's estimate.""

Celje hospital tightens security after assault by patient (adds),"After a patient assaulted two staff members, reportedly an ER nurse and doctor, on Wednesday the Celje hospital said on Friday that security had been tightened and that one of the victims had suffered a heart attack due to the stress experienced during the attack.","Dragan Kovačić, the acting director of the Celje General Hospital, said that the patient, who was not seriously ill, injured the arm of one staff member, who then suffered a heart attack, and broke the nose of the other by head-butting them.

Acting medical director Radko Komadina said the patient had been rowdy and impatient. He arrived at the emergency ward without a referral and fled the premises after the assault but was apprehended shortly thereafter.

It is unclear why he assaulted the staff members, said Komadina. The assault happened after the patient heard that the night shift was handing over to the morning shift.

Hospital management condemned the incident. Kovačić said the hospital was shocked that the situation in healthcare had become so strained as to lead to assaults on staff members.

There had been verbal altercation in the hospital before, but no assault had been seen in the past years, said Komadina.

Commenting on the incident, Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan said that his ministry condemned all types of violence. He stressed that it was not the fault of health staff that the health system was not working.

The ministry and the government will do all they can to sort out the situation in healthcare, he added.

Shaken by the incident, the Medical Chamber said in a press release that the safety of doctors and dentists was the prerequisite for the appropriate and high-quality treatment of patients.

The chamber condemned all forms of violence and called for zero tolerance of violence in healthcare institutions and in society in general.

Golden Bee goes to Serbian researcher Slobodan Davidović,"The Golden Bee, the highest national prize for beekeeping achievements, was conferred on Wednesday on Serbian researcher Slobodan Davidović. Agriculture Minister Irena Šinko, who chaired the committee picking the winner, said Davidović was a promising young researcher with advanced ideas and the ability to bring team members together.","""The Golden Bee Award is certainly one of Slovenia's main tools in raising awareness of the importance of pollinators and promoting specific achievements in their protection. This year's focus on science is in line with its central importance in addressing global challenges,"" said President Nataša Pirc Musar at today's ceremony at the Presidential Palace, calling for more investment in research.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food launched a call for nominations for the Golden Bee award last December. A dozen applications arrived from eight countries: three from Serbia, two each from Ukraine and Germany, and one each from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Spain and Greece, the president's office said.

The award committee shortlisted three candidates. Apart from Davidović, Fani Hatjina from Greece, an internationally renowned researcher at Cardiff University in the UK and long-time director of the Animal Institute of Greece, and Pau Enric Serra Marin, a young Spanish researcher and author of the award-winning documentary on bees Bee or Not to Be, were the finalists.

Davidović is the head of the Serbhiwe project, focussing on innovative strategic research, building on energy research on wild bees and pollinators, and setting milestones for action to fight dropping pollinator numbers by 2030. Together with members of the project, he has analysed genetic diversity of wild bee colonies and developed a roadmap for the analysis of wild populations that live in the wild without human intervention.

The minister said this was a very important research, as it showed how important genetic diversity was in wild pollinators and honey bees. ""Their research has shown that wild bees are more genetically diverse and more heterogeneous than native honey bees,"" Šinko stressed. She said this project would be the basis for Serbia's national strategy on habitat conservation and restoring wild pollinators in the wild.

Davidović said he was glad that the committee recognised their research as a study that has potential. ""I hope that this award will make the research more visible to researchers around the world and change the way we look at wild honey bees and the management of bees and other pollinators,"" he said.

The Golden Bee is the highest national award for the promotion, conservation and research of bees and other pollinators. It was introduced by a special law adopted in March 2021. The first two awards went to Argentina's Lucas Alejandro Garibaldi and the head of the Slovenian Beekeepers' Association, Boštjan Noč.",science and technology
Slovenian archaeologist discovers Ancient Maya city,"Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Šprajc and his team discovered remains of a Mayan city in the rainforest in the south of Mexico, which was an important regional hub of the indigenous society some 1,000 years ago, reports the ZRC SAZU research centre.","The Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History named the city Ocomtun, meaning ""stone column"" in the Maya language.

The research team found the city during a search of a largely unexplored stretch of jungle in the national park Balamku on the Yucatan peninsula. The search was conducted between March and June using aerial laser mapping (LiDAR) technology.

The city, which is located on high ground, includes several pyramid-like structures, stone pillars, three squares with large buildings, a ball court and other structures positioned in almost concentric circles.

The team discovered multiple altars near the La Riguena river, which might have been constructed for communal rituals. More research is needed to precisely determine their purpose, said Šprajc.

Ocomtun was most likely an important regional hub of the Mayan society and likely declined between the 9th and 11th century, in line with the downfall of the Mayan civilisation in the region.

Ivan Šprajc is a renowned Mesoamerican archaeology and archaeoastronomy expert. He and his research team have discovered several archaeological sites, including important Mayan regional political centres.

Šprajc has also played a key role in a groundbreaking study on the Maya calendar, in which researchers found that the Mayan timekeeping system is hundreds of years older than previous research indicated and might have been used as far back as in 1100 BC.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Plečnik Auditorium opens in Tivoli Park,An open-air amphitheatre originally designed by architect Jože Plečnik (1872-1957) has recently reopened in Ljubljana's Tivoli Park after a reconstruction to serve as a new cultural venue.,"Situated in a clearing behind Tivoli Mansion, the Plečnik Auditorium was built in 1933, but allowed to fall into disrepair after the Second World War.

Until the mid-1960s, the venue hosted an open-air summer cinema, but then the site became overgrown. The clearing is now surrounded by tall trees.

Following Plečnik's designs, wooden stairs serving as stands and supported by a steel structure were installed at the edge of the forest using the natural slant of the terrain.

At the bottom of the gently rising stairs is a lawn that serves as a stage overlooking the city, just like it did in Plečnik's design, only that the great master used gravel instead of grass.

The auditorium has been reconstructed by the architectural firm Medprostor. Architect Rok Žnidaršič says they applied a minimal and reversible intervention to reinterpret the original design at the original location and within original dimensions.

In this way they highlighted Plečnik's care for the public space as one of the key values in his contribution to the humanity's heritage, Žnidaršič was quoted as saying by the website ljubljana.si.

A wooden footbridge and a pathway links the venue to the Švicarija arts centre and Tivoli Mansion, which is home to the International Centre of Graphic Arts (MGLC).

The MGLC will be responsible for the management of the new venue and for the programme and coordination of events in it. As a rule, these will be admission free.

The first event inaugurating the Plečnik Auditorium was the opening of the 35th Ljubljana Biennale of Graphic Arts last month.

According to ljubljana.si, the reconstruction of the Plečnik Auditorium ran from March to November 2022 at the cost of EUR 376,000, VAT excluded.","arts, culture and entertainment"
AmCham event urges comprehensive structural reforms,"Drafting a health reform without undertaking other structural reforms is making empty promises, according to the participants of a discussion AmCham Slovenia hosted on Thursday. They stressed that Slovenia's healthcare is faced with growing costs, demographic challenges and a shortage of staff.","More money in healthcare is not the answer to all problems, as the system is also faced with a shortage of staff while not all capacities are used to the same degree, said Petra Došenovič Bonča from the Ljubljana School of Economics and Business.

She said the country gives nearly EUR 5 billion or 9.2% of its GDP for current expenses in healthcare, but the figure does not include all direct costs caused by illness nor investment funds. These are at 0.4% of GDP.

Urša Lakner from AmCham's commission for healthcare said the commission's stance is that all health organisations should be managed as a business, professionally. ""A good doctor will not necessarily make a good manager.""

She urged introducing bonuses to reward good work and indicators of quality to optimise processes. Lakner believes that transforming voluntary or top-up health insurance to mandatory insurance will not solve a single problem.

Similarly, MP Janez Cigler Kralj from the opposition New Slovenia (NSi) said the parliamentary Public Finance Oversight Commission had not received ahead of its session any figures how the transformation would impact public finances.

At yesterday's session, they were then told it would cost the national budget in 2024 around EUR 94 million and 139 million 2025, he said, while stressing that next year public finances will again have to comply with fiscal rules.

""The commission finds it unserious that such hasty changes are being made to the system, especially when the pension and long-term care systems should be modernised in a structurally wise manner,"" said Cigler Kralj.

Danijel Lamperger, director of the Chamber of Craft and Small Business, said business was against any new tax wedge. He stressed that the more an economy is competitive, the more it brings to the budget. But ""we're paying more already, and this hasn't resulted in any challenge being addressed.""

He also said there will be little interest among computer scientists to work for a company that is set to run the central digitalised healthcare system planned by the government if the company, yet to be formed, is managed the same way as public institutions.",health
Journalists accuse RTV management of ignoring strike demands,"Part of RTV Slovenija journalists went on strike on Tuesday protesting against a series of measures affecting their autonomy and independence. Strike committee members told the press that even after 19 meetings, the management does not or won't understand their strike demands, including for editorial autonomy and no intimidation.","The strike committee also demands a deal on staffing policy, talks on raising the lowest wages, reintroduction of social dialogue and that the strike be paid.

The journalists strike for a public RTV Slovenija, the right to be informed and the right to the freedom of speech, and because they must work in the public's interest.

They decided to go on strike after they went on the first strike in May 2022 because ""the reasons to call it off have not been eliminated"".

Pressure on journalist autonomy is increasing, professional standards are being violated, non-transparent staffing is continuing, the broadcaster is being financially drained, its reputation being tarnished, the strike committee members said, adding that talks on reaching a strike deal were continuing.

Another reason for stepping up strike activities are two recent court rulings which found the 2021 appointment of director general Andrej Grah Whatmough and his dismissal of TV Slovenija director Natalija Gorščak unlawful.

The strike committee members also said at the news conference that the management is undermining the strike.

While announcing it would not obstruct it, it replaced all editors and TV presenters on strike so that news shows could go ahead as if there was no strike.

In a separate statement, Culture Minister Asta Vrečko said the strike proved the situation was ""serious"" and urged the management to step down.

RTV staff have been warning about the situation for a year, said adding that RTV cannot carry out its mission in such circumstances.

She praised those on strike for their courage and determination, adding that the fate of the national broadcaster is currently in the hands of the Constitutional Court.

The court is deliberating on the changes to the RTV law passed under the current government in a bid to depoliticise appointments at RTV.

""The Slovenian public endorsed the new RTV law in a referendum and has the right to an independent public service with which politics will not interfere the way it has over the past 20 years. I think there's been enough of the management's pretending ignorance that it works in the interest of RTV and its autonomy,"" she said.

The journalists on strike and their supporters will gather again at 5pm in front of RTV headquarters for a rally.

Support for their demands was also expressed by several organisations, including the ZSSS association of trade unions, the Slovenian Association of Journalists (DNS), the Croatian Trade Union of Journalists, and the European Federation of Journalists.

The DNS also said that TV Slovenija's news shows no longer attain public service standards, its viewer ratings are dwindling and its editor violates the code of journalists.

It believes that every day the management continues managing the main public media ""the right of the public to be informed is seriously at stake"", and urged the management and the programme council to resign.",labour
Govt to set out tax reform in mid-March,The government will set out its proposal of tax reform in mid-March with Prime Minister Robert Golob telling MPs on Monday they would like to make the rich pay a fair share of the tax burden.,"Golob made the announcement in response to a question by opposition MP Jožef Horvat, who expressed concern that the taxpayers would pay for the projects planned by the government with higher taxes.

The New Slovenia (NSi) MP listed government promises of a public sector pay reform, a bonus for judges and prosecutors, abolishment of top-up health insurance, improvements in healthcare and construction of 30,000 new public rental apartments. ""Who will pay for it all?"" Horvat wondered.

Golob said most of the plans would not require a single euro more because the required funding had been secured in the 2023 and 2024 budgets that had been passed by parliament. ""Thus it's rather irresponsible trying to scare citizens as if these were new funds.""

The government has not announced anything new, he said. The same is true of the tax reform, which they announced before the election and set down in the coalition agreement.

He promised reducing the tax wedge on wages but ""first we intend to see to it that wealth is appropriately valued and that those who have much more wealth than most others will pay fair tax on that property"".

He would not go into details. The coalition parties are first planning to talk tax reform through at a meeting on 15 March, when more should also transpire about their pension reform plans. The government has already outlined its plans to reform healthcare, housing policy and the public sector pay system.",politics
Johannes Thingnes Boe wins pursuit race on Pokljuka,Norwegian biathlete Johannes Thingnes Boe won a men's pursuit World Cup race on Slovenia's Pokljuka plateau on Saturday despite two missed shots for what is his 100th podium result.,"""I'm really happy with my performance. This time shooting in the standing was not easy. But I felt fine after the first missed shot because I was still in the lead,"" said the 29-year-old winner, who has won seven of the ten races this season.

French Quentin Fillon Maillet, the current world champion, placed second (+1:04.9/1) and Norwegian Tarjei Boe third (+ 1:06.6/1).

Slovenia's best was Jakov Fak, who finished 17th with four missed shots (+2:45.8) after he placed 12th in sprint earlier this week.

Fak regretted shooing poorly, but said it felt good to be good in running. ""I know the shooting will be sorted out. But in terms of how I felt as a runner, I could have achieved more today.""

Another Slovenian, Miha Dovžan, finished 26th, with Alex Cisar at 34th and Anton Vidmar at 39th.

Coach Ricco Gross was happy that all four Slovenian biathletes managed to win points. ""But I feel sorry for Jakov. He hit the edge four times in the shooting. These are not real mistakes, but they are four. He failed to get among the top ten by shooting 90%, but he proved we're getting better and better as the races go on,"" he said.",sport
Commissioner Lenarčič says Slovenia expected to apply for European Solidarity Fund aid,"Slovenia is expected to apply for help from the European Solidarity Fund, which requires damage to exceed 0.6% of GDP, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič told the press after attending an emergency session of the government on Saturday.","The commissioner, who is in his home country as it is battling the worst natural disaster in its history, said that while Slovenia had already requested assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, it had more options at its disposal.

""Slovenia is not alone in these difficult times. It can count on the support of the EU and member states in various ways,"" he said in the face of the severe damage caused by flash floods.

Through the Civil Protection Mechanism, Slovenia can request specific assistance, which member states then organise as quickly as possible. So far, Slovenia has already requested satellite mapping to assess the full extent of the damage more easily, Lenarčič explained.

According to his understanding, Slovenia will also apply for help from the European Solidarity Fund, while he moreover listed the option of assistance from the EU's agricultural reserve, as well as available resources in existing EU programmes, such as cohesion funds, funds from the European Regional Development Fund, and the European Recovery and Resilience Facility.

The government confirmed at its session today that it would apply for international assistance and tasked the Defence Ministry and the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief with formulating requests in line with needs for resources that cannot be provided in sufficient amounts in Slovenia. Assistance has already been offered by a number of countries.

The government moreover allocated EUR 10 million in humanitarian aid to be distributed among the residents in the flood-stricken areas by two major charities in the country, the Red Cross of Slovenia and Slovenian Caritas. Each will receive EUR 5 million.",disaster and accident
Finance says Slovenia should not return to pre-flood state,"In Slovenia, people have been allowed to build houses along rivers and creeks and in areas prone to flooding and landslides. Now the country is paying for the odd spatial planning, the newspaper Finance comments on Wednesday.","After an earthquake, houses can be built on the same plots as before, but they must be better built and reinforced. ""Can we build replacement houses in (all?) flood and landslide areas?"" the paper wonders.

In Slovenia no one can ban municipalities from allowing construction in flood-prone areas if they promise to introduce flood protection measures, even if such measures are not implemented.

But in any case these measures take a long time to implement. In Železniki massive floods took place in 2007, and the construction of a detention basin is only now being completed. The most recent major flooding in Ljubljana took place in 2010, but not all flood control projects have been completed yet.

Several experts in different fields have said the problem is actually poor planning. Neither the planning minister or the prime minister have spoken about that yet. The ministry in charge of planning has no mechanism to prevent construction in flood-prone areas.

In the last 30 years, floods caused about EUR 2.1 billion in damage. In the last decade alone, the damage topped EUR 1.1 billion. Now, several billions of euros in damage was caused in just a few hours.

Thousands of landslides still pose a risk in Slovenia and no country is rich enough to be able to finance measures to prevent all of them so just like in flood-prone areas construction should not be allowed in such areas any more.

Environmentalist Jernej Stritih told the weekly Mladina the worst thing Slovenians could do is go back to how things were before the floods. Critical infrastructure should be moved to safer areas, while new bridges should be built without pillars in the water.

But who will tell people they can no longer live where they used to, what alternative can they be offered, the paper wonders in the commentary On the Rainy Side of Alps, noting that there are approximately 1,300 flood-prone areas in the county.",disaster and accident
Regulated fuel prices remain unchanged as govt raises excise duties,"The government has decided to raise excise duties on diesel and regular petrol, which means regulated prices will remain mostly unchanged in the next two-week period.","Regular petrol and diesel prices will remain unchanged, at EUR 1.416 and EUR 1.441 per litre, respectively.

Heating oil will be slightly cheaper, its price dropping from EUR 1.033 to EUR 1.022 per litre.

These prices will apply from Tuesday until 8 May, said the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy in a press release.

While the price of heating oil is regulated regardless of point of sale, petrol prices are only regulated outside the motorway network.

The price changes depending on the euro-dollar exchange rate and wholesale prices of oil derivatives, whereby the government often changes excise duties as well. Traders' margins are limited by government regulation.",weather
Minister says budget funding of healthcare will be restricted,"Responding to criticism about the financial consequences of the transformation of top-up health insurance into a mandatory contribution, Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič told the parliamentary Commission for Oversight of Public Finances on Wednesday that the safeguard for budget funding was quite restrictive.","The government decided to scrap top-up health insurance and replace it with a new mandatory contribution in April after a private insurer announced a hike in the top-up health insurance monthly premium.

Until a bill foreseeing the new contribution comes into force - the target date is 1 September this year - the government capped top-up health insurance premiums at around EUR 35, which is roughly what people have been paying so far.

As a safeguard against financial risks that could arise from abolishing supplementary health insurance, the government envisaged funds would be set aside in the state budget to cover for the shortfall in revenue over expenditure.

MP Jernej Vrtovec from the opposition New Slovenia (NSi), which proposed today's session of the commission, said that no calculations had been made to prove that this new contribution would be enough to cover for the share of health services costs currently covered by the top-up insurance.

He said the bill would give the ZZZS health fund a blank cheque and that it could count on any shortfall to be covered from the budget.

Since the budget acts for the coming years have already been passed, he asked whether they include the costs arising from covering this shortfall.

Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič said that intensive preparations for a supplementary budget for next year were under way and that this issue would be addressed as part of talks with individual ministries.

He stressed that the final version of the bill says that this budget safeguard was limited both in terms of duration and the amount of money that could be used for this purpose.

Covering the shortfall from the budget is envisaged only in 2024 for up to EUR 240 million, which is based on an assessment made by the Health Ministry, he said.

ZZZS's calculations show that the shortfall in revenue over expenditure should amount to some EUR 94 million in 2024, said Tamara Kozlovič, MP for the ruling Freedom Movement.

In 2025, the ZZZS puts the figure at about EUR 136 million, provided that no improvements are made to the health system and no health reform is introduced, which the coalition hopes will not be the case.

ZZZS director general Tatjana Mlakar said that the fund's projections showed costs would exceed revenue in the coming years by several hundred million euros, which the temporary safeguard providing money from the budget does not cover.

The healthcare will be seeing rising costs, including because of longer life expectancy, new methods of treatments and pay rises in healthcare, she said.",health
Baumüller's Slovenian subsidiary expanding production,"Baumüller Dravinja, a German-owned firm, is expanding production at a new facility, a EUR 7 million investment. This will double its production capacity for electrical equipment, while cables production will also move in it, Andreas Baumüller, the majority owner of the German group, said at the facility's inauguration earlier this week.","Baumüller Dravinja has been part of the German manufacturer of electrical drive systems and automation from Nuremberg for the past 30 years.

It has since increased the number of employees from 32 to 370 and its production areas from 3,600 to over 13,000 square metres.

Over the past ten years, its sales revenue increased from EUR 10 million to EUR 40 million last year.

Jožef Klajnšek, one of the two Baumüller Dravinja directors, said the expansion will helm them meet increasing orders and continue the company's successful growth.

""Due to the expansion of production, we are looking for more workers. We want to grow to over 400 employees and increase sales to EUR 45 million in two to three years,"" said Klajnšek, admitting it is not easy to find workers as the country is grappling with a shortage of labour in some industries.

Still, as the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine have resulted in lower orders recently, Baumüller Dravinja's revenue this year is palnned to be similar to last year's.

To reduce its dependency on energy markers and its footprint, they will shortly launch their won solar plant while also planning to cover the entire day shift's energy needs with their own energy in the future.

The Slovenian company's main markets are Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and France.","economy, business and finance"
Committee unhappy with lack of progress on Roma issues,"The parliamentary Home Affairs Committee discussed the situation of the Roma in Slovenia in an hours-long debate on Tuesday, with members expressing concern over the lack of progress. Many believe that situation has not improved but worsened over the past 30 years, while good practices are few and far between.","Representatives of several ministries and other bodies offered their insight. The acting director of the Government Office for National Minorities, Janez Doltar, highlighted as a success a kindergarten in Pušča, a Roma village outside Murska Sobota, which opened in 1962, but said that ""60 years of progress have been lost"" in some other areas.

Jožek Horvat Muc, the president of the Roma Community Council, said that more concrete and active involvement is needed in addressing the community's issues, as well as listening to the proposals that come from the Roma.

Dan Juvan, a state secretary at the Labour and Social Affairs Ministry, believes it is vital to continue ongoing work with Roma community members, address housing issues, and nurture and upgrade existing measures and programmes.

Meanwhile, the Human Right Ombudsman expects the government to draft an emergency bill that would enable, at least temporarily, access to potable water, bathrooms and electricity, to those living in illegal settlements.

Ombudsman Peter Svetina demanded that a list be created of all Roma settlements that are impossible to legalise and be fitted with utility infrastructure, and that systemic solutions be found for these communities.

Svetina warned that the ""absence of measures at the national level is leading to local communities taking things in their own hands"".

He said he had ""a lot of information about troubled cohabitation"", adding that the special protective status the Roma have under the constitution does not absolve them of responsibility for illegal acts.

Predrag Bakovič of the junior coalition Social Democrats (SD) and Maja Bah Žibert of the opposition Democrats (SDS) both said that tensions were rising in southeastern Slovenia.

""People feel powerless, they are starting to self-organise, which is not good,"" said Baković, with Bah Žibert underlining that changes are needed.

Pointing to a draft bill filed into parliamentary procedure by mayors from southeastern Slovenia in an effort to increase the number of Roma children in primary school, Bah Žibert said the move was a logical consequence of the situation.

Vida Čadonič Špelič, an MP for the opposition New Slovenia (NSi), agreed with Bah Žibert and expressed expectation that the government will not only criticise the proposal, but tell what is good and not good in it and and provide proposals of its own.

Tamara Vonta of the ruling Freedom Movement meanwhile believes that the bill will not solve anything, saying that repression never produced the desired results. Meanwhile, Tatjana Greif of the coalition Left said the discussion showed deep stigma and prejudice against the Roma.

The committee passed several resolutions, among other things underlining the importance of cooperation between the Roma and local communities, and encouraging more organised activities for Roma children and families.

Moreover, the committee adopted a resolution drafted by the Freedom Movement and the Left, proposing that municipalities that receive Roma-related state funding start reporting on the use of these funds to make sure they are used purposely. Both opposition parties, as well as the SD voted against this.

This year, 25 municipalities with Roma population will get EUR 6 million, with Doltar saying that these had not been distributed effectively, because the amounts did not necessarily reflect the size of the Roma community in individual municipalities. Moreover, the funds are often not used the way they should be.

Meanwhile, Fatmir Bećiri, vice president of the Roma Community Council, said that some projects meant to improve the situation of the Roma are not designed the right way.

The committee session took place just as the government sent to parliament its annual report on the situation of the Roma community in Slovenia on Tuesday. The National Assembly is to take note of the report.",social issue
Social workers under scrutiny after six-year-old tests positive for cocaine (adds),"A six-year-old boy has been found with cocaine in his system after staying with his father in Piran. The father is in custody while the social work centre in charge is under scrutiny. Reactions have come from top officials, but the centre has rejected claims it had not heeded the mother's warnings the father, a drug addict, is unfit to be a carer.","TV Slovenija reported on Thursday that the mother suspected something was amiss after her son returned from his father with a headache and feeling sick. She bought an at-home drug test, which showed the boy was positive for cocaine.

Repeat screening tests performed at the emergency unit of the community health centre and the Izola hospital were positive as well. The boy was also diagnosed with a heart murmur.

The boy was unable to tell his mother how the drug entered his system. The mother told TV Slovenija that her son had severe nose bleeds and frequent bouts of angina over the past six moths.

The 40-year-old father from Piran is in custody, facing charges of child neglect, brutal treatment and enabling the child to use illicit drugs. If found guilty, he faces between one and 12 years in prison for drug possession and between one and three years for child neglect.

Oversight has meanwhile been introduced at the Piran unit of the Social Work Centre Primorska after the TV Slovenija report indicated that social services had failed to heed the mother's warnings, as well as a warning from the boy's primary school, which had also noticed the boy's distress.

While explanations were demanded today by Minister of Labour, Family, and Social Affairs Luka Mesec and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Social Work Centre Primorska said it had received no information between February 2021 and 29 May 2023 - when it was contacted by the school - that would have necessitated action.

The centre added that after it had been contacted by the school, it informed the mother of the possibility of applying for an interim court order concerning the custody of the child and the prohibition of contact with the father.

When receiving the notice of the court, the centre backed the mother's proposal, assessing the child was in serious peril and proposed that the father be banned from seeing the boy until a final decision of the court.

Elaborating on the long history of the case, the centre further explained that it is not the competent authority for verifying allegations about a parent's drug dependency. ""In such cases it proposes that the court appoint a forensic expert who can assess this.""

Minister Mesec has announced determined action once the findings of the inspection under way are known. Also speaking of ongoing reform efforts involving social work centres, he highlighted the issue of the centres being overwhelmed by administrative tasks.

The ombudsman's office meanwhile wrote that in practice, the competent institutions still did not do enough to protect children's rights and that individual social work centres often delayed carrying out their duties related to the prevention of domestic violence.",health
"Presidential candidates spent EUR 8,000-190,000 on election campaign","Candidates running in the 2022 presidential election spent from just over EUR 8,000 to EUR 190,000 on financing their election campaign. The four candidates who won at least 10% of the vote will get part of their expenses refunded. The winner, Nataša Pirc Musar, spent EUR 124,600 on her campaign and will get back EUR 58,000.","A candidate as an organiser of campaigning can spend up to 25 cents per voter, which translates into around EUR 423,000, but no candidate came close to this sum.

The most funds, just over EUR 190,000, were spent on Milan Brglez's campaign, the majority coming from the two parties that nominated him, shows the financial report on the presidential election campaign.

The ruling Freedom Movement spent just over 73,000 on his campaign, and his own party, the Social Democrats (SD), EUR 20,000. The rest came from donations.

Coming second in terms of the funds spent is Anže Logar, who ran independently but is a member of the opposition Democrats (SDS). His campaign cost EUR 175,000, with the bulk coming from donations.

Also funding much of her campaign with donations (EUR 91,000) was the election winner Nataša Pirc Musar, while her entire campaign cost EUR 124,600.

Pirc Musar, Logar and Brglez all received donations from several physical persons that exceeded the monthly gross salary in the country.

Pirc Musar contributed around EUR 19,000 herself, and so did her husband Aleš Musar. Logar, who lost to Pirc Musar in the run-off, also invested EUR 19,000.

Under the law, a physical person can spend on an election campaign the amount matching ten average monthly salaries from the previous year, in this case no more than EUR 19,700.

New Slovenia (NSi) spent just over EUR 100,000 on its candidate Janez Cigler Kralj, all coming from the party's bank account.

The other four candidates spent much less - Kočevje Mayor Vladimir Prebilič spent just over EUR 21,000, the coalition Left's MP Miha Kordiš just over EUR 8,000, and Sabina Senčar, the candidate of the non-parliamentary party Resni.ca, EUR 5,000, with almost half of the sum coming from one donor.

The four candidates who won at least 10% of the vote, or the organisers of their campaigns, will get partly refunded. The winner Pirc Musar will receive EUR 58,000, Logar EUR 49,700, Brglez EUR 16,000 and Prebilič EUR 11,000.

Preiskovalno.si quotes IT experts in saying that the ministry had ordered laptops of average if not low quality that are not appropriate for any serious work. The processors are old and graphics cards very basic. Each laptop cost less than EUR 500 with tax, the portal says.

Given that schools were equipped with laptops during the Covid-19 pandemic and received EUR 2 million to purchase computer equipment a year ago, questions have arisen where these devices would be used.

The ministry said in response that an open call was published on 21 July with the procedure led by the Public Administration Ministry. It confirmed that the deal had been won by Lancom, Unistar, Gambit Trade, and Acord-92.

Since the condition was that the price for a laptop must not exceed EUR 500 with tax, three providers offered computers with the 12th generation processors. The ministry asserted that the laptops met the needs of both beginners and more advanced users, as the difference between the processors of the 12th and 13th generations is minimal.

The ministry said the laptops had been purchased for three groups - to be rented out free of charge by members of vulnerable groups; kindergartens and primary schools; and legal persons governed by public law that were affected by floods and landslides.",labour
Summer camp organised for children from families affected by floods,"The Civil Protection and the association Friends of Youth Mojca will be organising a free summer camp for children of families affected by the recent floods, as well as children of volunteers helping with the clean-up effort, Sandi Curk, the commander of Civil Protection for the Notranjska region, announced on Wednesday.","""We want to take the children, who witnessed the brutal force of the storms and saw their parents cry, from that environment, so it will be easier for the parents to set up normal living conditions,"" said Curk. ""We want the children to enjoy a normal day in the sun, to experience what the floods took away from them.""

While the camp will take place in the spa resort of Dolenjske Toplice in southern Slovenia, the organisers also hope to take the children to the seaside, he said.

Taking place between 13 and 19 August, the summer camp will be free of charge. There is room for 60 children between the ages of 5 and 17, the Government Communications Office said.

Curk also talked about the voluntary aid pool website set up by the government on Monday. So far more than 22,000 people, groups of people and organisations have offered their services and goods.

Currently demand is highest for heavy machinery and contractors, as well as dehumidifiers, different tools and building materials.

The Civil Protection believes that the majority of those who offered their services will be included in the clean up management system by next week.

Those who come to the flood-stricken areas need to be self-sufficient, bringing their own food and drink, among other things. ""Work areas will be carefully planned so as to avoid any danger to people's health and lives,"" said Curk.

Mojca Podbregar Ferjančič of the Notranjska Civil Protection said that their job is to match the demand with the aid offered, adding that solutions have been found to address about a half of the most urgent needs.",disaster and accident
Slovenia faces challenges in expanding EV charging network,"In line with the new European regulation, Slovenia will have to install 16 to 20 high-capacity charging points for electric vehicles along motorways. Since none of the current stations can provide sufficient capacity, the country faces the challenge of increasing the capacity of the charging network or setting up new stations.","The Council of the EU approved this week the regulation for the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, under which charging points for electric cars with an output of at least 400 kilowatts will have to be set up at least every 60 kilometres along the EU's core transport network (TEN-T) by 2026.

Moreover, the charging network will have to increase its power output to 600 kW by 2028.

Charging stations for lorries and buses will have to be installed every 120 kilometres, and by 2028 these points will have to be available at least along half of the bloc's main road connections with an output of 1,400-2,800 kW.

Since a vast majority of Slovenian motorways are part of the TEN-T, the regulation means the country will have to step up.

""Primarily, we will need to strengthen the network at certain petrol station charging points or set up new sites for charging electric vehicles. What we envisage is to enhance the distribution network at the existing sites up to three megawatts,"" the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy told the STA.

Given the rapid growth of electric mobility and the fact that Slovenia is a transit country, the country has decided to set up large charging parks with a total output of three megawatts and more and in close proximity to the electricity transmission grid.

The new regulation also sets out a gradual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from ships. To significantly reduce air pollution in ports, by 2030, container and passenger ships will have to generate all their electricity from shore, in major European ports.

As a result, the port of Koper is also planning new, capacity-increasing infrastructure.

What the Council also approved this week are amendments to the energy efficiency directive, which will require member states to ensure an 11.7% overall reduction in final energy consumption in the EU by 2030 compared to expected consumption in 2020.

The ministry said that the updated national energy and climate plan would take the target into account.",environmental issue
Ex-president calls for independence memorial in Ljubljana,"Slovenia's former President Milan Kučan has urged erecting a memorial to Slovenian independence in Republic Square in Ljubljana as he addressed a WWII commemoration in Vrhnika on Friday. Kučan, who served when independence was declared, believes such a memorial would unite the nation, encouraging it to successfully address challenges ahead.","The memorial to Slovenian independence would pay tribute to the Slovenians as a nation that achieved independence just over 30 years ago, he said in his speech.

Kučan said gaining independence was an act of nation-building unparalleled in the history of Slovenians and as such deserves ""a reflection that we should honour it with a dignified symbol"".

""Such a monument would rightly have its place in the central square of our capital, Republic Square, where many of the acts of independence took place.""

Republic Square is located opposite the National Assembly and was the venue for the ceremony at which independence was declared on 26 June 1991.

The monument would carry an important message to future generations that freedom and dignity must be won again and again and that nothing in the history of a nation is gained without an effort.

It would also testify to the fact that courage and reason are needed in such moments, which were also the guiding principles of the army that liberated the town of Vrhnika on 5 May 1945, proceeding to Ljubljana, he added.

Known as Revolution Square when Slovenia was still part of Yugoslavia, the square already has two memorials by acclaimed Slovenian sculptor Drago Tršar.

The Memorial to Revolution was unveiled in 1975 to honour the nation's struggle against the occupying forces in WWII and the communist revolution that took place at the same time. Six years later, a memorial was unveiled to Edvard Kardelj (1910-1979), a senior Slovenian politician and a close aide of Josip Broz - Tito.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Delo say govt has not sent the right message to schools,"The newspaper Delo says in Saturday's front-page commentary that head teachers' demands for higher wages had been expected. If they got the kind of bonus that judges got, this would cost the state EUR 8.6 million a year, while EUR 200 million has been allocated to doctors, the alliance of head teachers says.","The stories of head teachers are actually sad. They suffer from burnout and many of them want to quit their job, because they can earn more money as teachers, the paper says.

Why would a top teacher who has good relations with students, parents and other teachers want to become head teacher if this meant lower pay? Who will still want to be head teacher? Those who are not so good? And what will schools be like if they are led by head teachers who are not very good?

""It is not even important how much money doctors and judges got. The problem is that the state did not send a clear and unambiguous message that the education system is important. Not just important, but crucial for our future.

""If there will be no teachers, there will also be no doctors, judges ... Of course pay raise is not everything. But it is a start. And probably one of the few ways to keep the best in the system, which is for now still considered one of the best,"" Delo says under the headline Burned-Out Head Teachers Want Higher Wages.",education
Man gets suspended sentence for smuggling over 6 tonnes of tobacco into Croatia,"A Slovenian man has been accused of smuggling 6.4 tonnes of tobacco into Croatia onboard a truck. He got a one-year suspended prison sentence on a five-year probation and a fine of EUR 13,000 in Zagreb, the newspapers Delo and Slovenske Novice reported.","Ivan Oset pleaded guilty at the Zagreb Municipal Court and regretted his actions, which the court took into account when handing down his sentence.

According to the indictment, issued on 18 July 2022, the man loaded 6.4 tonnes of tobacco leaves on a truck, which he then drove to Croatia without any documents. The truck was unloaded at a warehouse near Zagreb by two other men, who were also accused of illegal trade in tobacco.","crime, law and justice"
Dnevnik sees shortcomings in new passenger centre,"Commenting on the plans for the long-awaited Ljubljana passenger centre, the newspaper Dnevnik suggests there is too much focus on parking spaces and too little on passenger comfort when changing between coach and train services and city buses.","The paper notes that the passenger centre has been planned for more than two decades, during which time both plans and many potential investors have changed, so it expresses a degree of scepticism that the terminal will indeed be completed by the end of 2025.

Hailing the latest changes to the plans presented earlier this week, the paper also points to some shortcomings, one of which is that the connections with the Ljubljana city bus routes remain virtually unchanged.

This means that a passenger wishing to change train for a bus service on Dunajska Road will have to either walk to one of the stops on Dunajska or take another bus to the next stop and change buses there.

""This unwillingness to provide for the passenger's comfort in changing services is the more bizarre knowing that the Ljubljana municipality approved construction of thousands of new parking spaces in the planned commercial and residential buildings around the passenger centre.

""How absurd to be securing parking spaces to buildings at the very heart of the city centre that could hardly have better access to trains, intercity, regional and international bus lines.""

Finally, the paper quotes CEO of the railway company in saying that the shortcomings in the publicly-funded project had been much improved since the abandoned public-private partnership with TriGranit.

""In the end we are supposed to be happy that the joint venture contract with TriGranit was rescinded despite years being wasted ... It is cause for concern that no one of those involved was willing to admit to the shortcomings at the time,"" reads the piece Luckily They Didn't Start Building Earlier.",labour
Limits placed on extra payments to cut hospital waiting times,The government has adopted legislation that places limits on payments to health providers under a scheme designed to cut hospital waiting times. Not all services will be covered this way and private providers will no longer be eligible.,"In July 2022 the Act on Emergency Measures to Ensure the Stability of Healthcare System was passed in order to cut waiting times. Extra payments for all services were provided and private practitioners were eligible if public providers could not perform the services.

It has since transpired that most of the money had been spent on less complex but more profitable services.

The amendments to the act, adopted at a correspondence session last night, limit these extra payments to a pre-determined set of services that will be confirmed by the government at the proposal of the ZZZS, the public health insurer.

Private providers, which could perform services under this law a a backup, if public providers could not, will no longer be eligible for these funds.

The measure is being transformed to specifically targeted health services where waiting times are longest and health benefits are highest,"" the government said.

When it was first announced last year, the legislation was billed as a ""stress test"" for the healthcare system designed to see how many services the system is capable of performing.

Data released by the government in April show that between October and December last year, public and private health providers performed extra services worth EUR 79 million.

More than a third of money, 36%, was spent by concessionaires and a quarter by both university medical centres in Ljubljana and Maribor. Other hospitals accounted for 22% of spending and community health centres for 19%.

Overall, public providers accounted for 64% of all spending and private providers with concessions for 36%.",health
"Appeals court upholds sentences for magazine editor, columnist","The Ljubljana Higher Court rejected appeals by defendants and upheld the guilty sentences for former editor-in-chief of the weekly Demokracija Jože Biščak and columnist Aleksander Škorc who received suspended prison time for inciting hatred and spreading racist ideas, Večer reports.","Škorc was handed a five-month suspended sentence on a two-year probation and Biščak got a six-month suspended sentence on a two-year probation by a lower court in 2022.

The criminal complaint against the two was filed by philosopher Boris Vezjak over an article by Škorc published in Demokracija, a magazine co-owned by the Democratic Party (SDS), in December 2020.

Vezjak argued that in the article Škorc spread the idea of the supremacy of the white race and then ""combined it with convictions of some kind of God's will, which automatically supports the white supremacy, including the eradication of other races"".

Demokracija has insisted Škorc's text was satire, a notion the court disagreed with.","crime, law and justice"
Mountain Rescue Service urges diplomats to raise awareness about safe hiking,"The number of people hiking in the Slovenian mountains has been increasing for years and so has the number of accidents. Last year, the number of foreigners who had to be rescued exceeded the number of Slovenian hikers in distress for the first time ever, prompting the Mountain Rescue Service to urge embassies to advise caution.","With the summer season just around the corner, the Mountain Rescue Service and the Alpine Association organised a rescue demonstration at Vogel on Wednesday, also inviting embassy representatives, asking them to use their channels and raise awareness about dangers in the mountains.

""Last year was another record year in terms of the number of accidents, and for the first time ever the number of foreign hikers that needed rescuing exceeded the number of Slovenians,"" said Mountain Rescue Service president Gregor Dolinar.

A total of 667 interventions were required last year and over 55% of them included foreign citizens: 73 rescue efforts included German citizens, and 35 efforts included French citizens, followed by Dutch, Czech, Polish, Hungarian, Belgian, British, Croatian, Italian and Austrian citizens.

The most frequent cause for accidents among foreign hikers is inappropriate or lacking equipment, poor knowledge of terrain and inadequate physical fitness.

""Slovenian mountains are specific in that they are the lowest of all Alpine countries, but still very demanding in some parts, which surprises many tourists,"" said Dolinar.

Yesterday's rescue demonstration showed a real life operation that was required after a father decided to descend from Vogel back into the valley on foot over very steep terrain with two small children. There were three other similar cases in the Vogel area last year, all involving foreigners.

The Alpine Association believes that Slovenian mountains draw around 1.3 million people during the summer season alone, and Alpine Association vice president Martin Šolar hopes for better cooperation with tourism organisations.

Often, the information provided by tourism organisations is inadequate, while information from apps may be unreliable and misleading, Šolar warned.

Moreover, Peter Jeromel, the president of the Association of Mountain Guides, advised that people hire guides. Guided tours are like a crash course in mountaineering, imparting a lot of knowledge on participants, he said.

So far this year, the number of accidents in the mountains is below last year's, but only because the weather has been very poor in the past weeks. But in the summer, the Mountain Rescue Service expects another record season.",disaster and accident
"Synthetic fuels compromise acceptable for Slovenia, Golob says","Slovenia finds acceptable the EU proposal to exclude synthetic fuels from the 2035 petrol and diesel engine ban, said Prime Minister Robert Golob as he arrived for an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.","""Slovenia's position is that what is good for Germany's automotive industry is generally always good for Slovenia's automotive industry,"" said Golob, adding that this is an important part of Slovenia's industrial production and exports.

""This means that the compromise drafted by the Commission that is on the table today is perfectly acceptable for us,"" Golob said.

According to the explanation of the draft obtained by the STA, the amended ban on petrol and diesel engines would make an exception for internal combustion engines fuelled exclusively by synthetic fuels made using renewable sources of energy.

The European Parliament has approved the law banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2035 in February. Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and Poland later objected to the complete ban, requesting the exception for synthetic fuels.",environmental issue
SDS absorbs fmr Maribor mayor's party,"The Democrats (SDS), the largest opposition party, have absorbed the New People's Party (NLS) of former Maribor mayor Franc Kangler in a move that SDS president Janez Janša described as a ""merger of Slovenian democratic people's patriotic forces"".","The agreement was signed at a ceremony marking the 34th anniversary of the party's foundation on Saturday and marks the first time since its inception that the SDS has joined forces with another party in such a way.

Janša said the merger strengthened the party's position in and around Maribor, the NLS's home turf, where Kangler entered the mayoral run-off last year. Combined, the two parties will have the same number of councillors as the mayor's list.

According to him, political forces that do not achieve the threshold to enter parliament ""must join forces one way or anther to form joint lists or parties to strengthen real representation in parliament.""

Janša said that the SDS is a serious political force that ""welcomes everybody who advocates the democratic order and rejects totalitarianisms of all colours.""

Some commentators have speculated that the joining of forces with the NLS is just the start of consolidation on the right, and Aleš Hojs, the party's vice president, was coy when asked about that.

""I would not forecast anything for now, but it is indisputable that quite a few parties remain outside parliament after every election and quite a few are very similar and could cooperate with us in the future,"" he said.

Kangler said one of the reasons for the merger is the ""worsening political instability and political frictions.""

He does not currently have any formal role in the SDS but will probably run to head the Maribor chapter of the SDS, which is currently headed by MP Dejan Kaloh.

The merger will be sealed when the NLS congress has confirmed it, presumably in a month, and Kangler was optimistic saying that the party's presidency had been almost unanimously in favour with only one member abstaining.

The NLS was founded in 2016, four years after Kangler stepped down as Maribor mayor amidst massive protests due to the blanketing of the city with speed traps.

The party has had success locally, most recently winning over 15% of the city council vote in Maribor, almost twice as much as the SDS, while Kangler has twice contested the mayoral race in the city after his resignation and entered the run-off both times.

He has remained politically close with the SDS, having served as state secretary at the Interior Ministry in the last Janez Janša government.",politics
President to receive army readiness report,"Defence Minister Marjan Šarec and Maj-Gen Robert Glavaš, the chief of the general staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, will present on Friday to President Nataša Pirc Musar the annual army readiness report for 2022. Her predecessor Borut Pahor said last year after accepting the 2021 report the army was capable of protecting the country.","The army readiness reports have in recent years showed slight progress but in general the readiness was seen as good for peacetime and inadequate for wartime.

Progress has been detected last year for 2021 but the army was still not seen as fit to operate in wartime.

The report also said that the army was affected by its offering support to police and civil protection in protecting the border, which meant that troops are not being trained as they should for their basic task, which is to protect the country.

Soldiers are no longer involved in protecting the border as of this year, when Croatia joined the Schengen Area, while the latest report will look at the situation last year.

Pirc Musar recently said she had asked the Defence Ministry to also include data about the army's readiness in energy, food, transport or infrastructure security in the report.

The National Assembly passed last week a resolution that sets out a plan for the development of the Slovenian Armed Forces by 2040 under which Slovenia is to spend 2% of GDP on defence by 2030, five years before the current deadline.","unrest, conflicts and war"

Dnevnik says students most affected by Covid did well in final exams,"The generation whose high school years were most affected by Covid and distance education has graduated with the results of their national school-leaving exams, known as the matura, not deviating much from the long-term average, the newspaper Dnevnik says in Tuesday's commentary.","The generation that graduated this year switched to distance learning already in the first year of high school, and spent most of the time switching between going to school and distance learning. It was only in their final year that there were no more doubts - they were able to prepare for the matura at schools, in direct contact with their teachers.

""The annual comparison of matura results is reassuring. On average, grades do not deviate significantly from the long-term average.

"Capital of Culture project progressing well, EU report says","The European Commission has assessed that the 2025 European Capital of Culture project of Slovenia's Nova Gorica and Italy's Gorizia has so far shown serious commitment.

The Commission appreciates the commitment to signing project contracts with both public institutions and non-governmental organisations, the report adds.

Also positively assessed is the progress in establishing international connections by means of closer cooperation with European cultural centres and networks, as well as the willingness of the Nova Gorica team to learn from past ECC projects.

Currently in the greatest demand are services and material for the repair of buildings, roads and other infrastructure.","When a user logs in, the application shows a list of services and material that the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration needs for the flood-stricken areas.

Currently in the greatest demand is transportation of people and material, including with heavy machinery and lorries, and tractor assistance. Help is also needed in construction and mechanical work, repair of plumbing, electrical and gas installations and installation of heating devices.

The list of services that are in demand includes painting, parquetry and laying of other types of flooring, masonry, installation of prefabricated walls, roofing, carpentry, facade work, metalworking, locksmithing, protection of property in the affected areas, recording with drones and installation of toilet cubicles.

In construction and mechanical work, there is a need for workers and operational managers, technicians and engineers, while also in demand is professional assistance from geologists and experts for bridge safety assessment.

People with special needs in the affected areas need assistance, and people also need helping hands in farmwork.

Also required in the flood relief efforts is construction material, fuel, agricultural and forestry equipment, machines and tools, protective work equipment and material for assistance to farmers. The aid provider can either lease or lend it.

""What is important at this stage is that this help is used to clear roads, renovate houses, and remove material,"" Sandi Curk of the Civil Protection told the STA, adding that the list would be adjusted depending on the situation.

Curk called on craftspersons and entrepreneurs to send their teams, which would be ""self-sufficient and able to immediately get involved in work on the ground,"" to the affected areas for a day or two.

He added that the Civil Protection would ensure the access of volunteers and material to places that are difficult to access. ""We are making the effort for help to come to these areas quickly, but not all roads are open yet.""

Curk noted that around 1,200 individuals and groups had offered help through the application in the first two hours alone. ""Citizens are the greatest heroes,"" he said, thanking everybody for the readiness to help.

The chamber will forward the data collected through the platform to all competent institutions, including Civil Protection, local communities and competent ministries, which will further disseminate the information, the GZS said.

It added on its website that, while the damage caused by the floods is still being assessed, there are reports that some individual businesses have suffered damage that exceeds tens of millions of euros.",disaster and accident
"Idea about independence monument not new, ex-PM says (adds)","Lojze Peterle, who served as prime minister when Slovenia declared independence in 1991, supports the idea to erect a Slovenian independence monument in Republic Square in Ljubljana. Speaking to the press on Tuesday, he said that former President Milan Kučan, who had proposed the monument, was not the first one to come up with this idea.","Kučan, who served as president when independence was declared, urged erecting such a monument as he addressed a WWII commemoration in Vrhnika on Friday, convinced it would unite the nation.

Peterle, who is now president of the Association for the Values of Slovenian Independence, said he had proposed the same idea to President Borut Pahor in 2016, when Slovenia celebrated the 25th anniversary of independence.

At the time, he also said the Revolution Monument in the square, which according to him symbolises a violent takeover of power by communists, is not a symbol of democratic Slovenia.

However, he agrees with Kučan that ""the former times and the symbol we have in Republic Square divided us and that a new monument should unite us"".

""I'd like to see such important things as the independence monument to be a matter of national consensus,"" Peterle told the press.

The prime minister of the first democratically elected Slovenian government (May 1990-May 1992) believes Republic Square must be dedicated exclusively to the values of independence.

The square served as a venue to declare independence on 26 June 1991, and two monuments related to the communist past are erected there.

Peterle would like to have a discussion on how to get to a monument of independence, proposing passing a bill that would set down its purpose.

He would also like to assume a broader perspective on monuments to the communist revolution, saying ""monuments"" in Council of Europe Park near Cankarjev Dom were inappropriate.

The park has a statue to Boris Kidrič, one of the leading Slovenian communist politicians, but Peterle believes monuments to the revolution do not belong there.

Responding to the idea, Prime Minister Robert Golob said on Tuesday that he supports Kučan's idea and that the government will take the initiative to erect the monument, while the implementation is a matter for experts.

""I also support all the other initiatives designed to overcome any divisions and to bring stances of various sides closer together. I think it's high time we put an end to divisions and started working together, and if this initiative and such a monument should contribute to this, then we could all be more satisfied.""

Golob made the statement after the Ljubljana city council's ceremony marking Ljubljana Day. He said Kučan had shared the idea with him after the ceremony.

While the government will financially support the erection of the monument, ""from there on, it's up to experts to ensure on the one hand that the lessons of history are properly respected and on the other that we give a chance to more recent history, the history which we can be particularly proud of, because it really united Slovenians. And I'd like to see it unite us again when we erect this monument,"" said Golob.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Bosnian man killed outside his flat,"A 42-year old foreign citizen, reportedly from Bosnia and Herzegovina, was shot to death on Tuesday morning in the area of Žalec, north-east of the capital. He worked in Slovenia and lived alone in a room in the apartment building where he was shot, the Celje Police Department said on Friday.","According to the newspaper Slovenske Novice, the victim was a Bosnian citizen who lived in an apartment building in Trnava near Žalec. The paper also said that he was shot seven times, citing anonymous, but reliable sources.

His neighbour told the newspaper that he had heard shots fired on Tuesday morning, which had seemed to him like someone was banging on the door.

After waiting in his room for a few minutes, he went into the hallway to look and found the man on the ground in a pool of blood.

Paramedics arrived just under an hour later and tried to resuscitate the man but were unsuccessful.

The neighbour knew the victim only in passing. ""I heard he had problems at work, that they weren't getting along, that he was in debt,"" he said, adding that perhaps the perpetrator was someone that the victim owed money to.

The investigation is still ongoing but the police confirmed that the man died a violent death, Slovenske Novice writes.","crime, law and justice"
"Doctors' union says pay talks futile, indicates withdrawal","The Fides trade union of doctors and dentists on Monday labelled the pay negotiations with the government futile, adding it will no longer take part in talks about ""phantom pay tiers"" which are nothing but a ""smokescreen for the public"". The union's top body also tasked the management to prepare a plan for further activities.","Today, the union's main committee was in session for the first time after 30 June, a deadline the government has set for itself to submit to parliament a bill enacting a separate pay tier for healthcare.

""We cannot but wonder what the government means when it says that healthcare is a priority?! If this continues, Fides will no longer take part in talks about phantom pay tiers ... and bear the responsibility for complete disintegration of the public healthcare system in Slovenia.""

""We examined the situation and have come to realise that during the negotiations the government has failed to fulfil a single promise from the strike agreement signed in October 2022,"" the union said in a press release.

The failure to address poor working conditions is intensifying the pace at which doctors are leaving the public healthcare system, which is a major risk, the union said.

Instead of stabilisation promised by the government there is a state of emergency that creates uncertainty among employees and patients alike, and has also come to jeopardise basic care in some emergency centres, Fides said.

Following a strike, Fides has been in pay talks with the government since October 2022. The government promised to address pay demands in public sector pay reform, envisaging several separate pay tiers for different sectors.

The completion of the healthcare tier was initially planned for 1 April, but the timeline proved too optimistic and to avoid another strike, the government promised to submit the relevant legislation by 30 June.",labour
Paper calls for action to increase food production,"Primorske Novice calls for immediate action to increase food production as it argues in Monday's commentary that Slovenia does not produce enough food, partially due to red tape and partially due to unrealistic expectations about what agriculture should be like.","Domestic producers are almost expected to hand-weed their fields, greenhouses ruin the vistas of the unspoilt countryside, and irrigation systems require almost as many permits as a nuclear power station.

Despite that, the food they produce is supposed to compete on price with imports from huge plantations with cheap labour, produced with effective yet damaging chemicals.

In this inequality, everyone is a loser because retailers satisfy the majority of the demand for fruit and vegetables with imports of produce that are not what we expect.

""Combined with excessive red tape in the name of Europe ... the mixing of hobby gardening concepts, hipster ethics and niche production has led to backsliding in the exploitation of Slovenia's natural food production resources,"" the paper says in Pears, Apples, Plums.

Against the backdrop of unrest in neighbouring regions and the increasingly apparent climate change, this demands immediate action by the government.

""The objective is clear: to produce sufficient quantities of safe and healthy food in a sustainable way... If there is no wheat, there will be no bread or brioche.""",environmental issue
Slovenian analyst expects new snap election in Spain,"Political analyst Luka Lisjak Gabrijelčič has assessed for the STA that the general election in Spain has resulted in a stalemate that will seem to require another early election. The right bloc is disappointed after falling short of an expected majority, while the left bloc is also weaker than it would want, Lisjak Gabrijelčič said on Monday.","The analyst said that it was clear that the centre-right People's Party (PP) led by Alberto Nunez Feijoo will not be able to build a majority coalition, not even with the far-right Vox, which is a result at odds with opinion poll projections and the two parties' upbeat results in the May regional and local elections.

Lisjak Gabrijelčič said the risky decision by Prime Minster Pedro Sanchez, head of the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), for a snap election seems to have paid off. He feels there has been ""a mobilisation of left-wing voters, especially those who had already been hostile to far-right politics"", as well as a demobilisation of a part of the centre-right voters who were put off by Vox's far-right positions.

Frictions within the centre-right bloc also contributed to the right's poor result, while the centre-left ""was relatively united this time"". Lisjak Gabrijelčič assessed that Feijoo ""tried all along to distance himself from Vox in some way"", even though it was clear that he would accept their support.

While PSOE ""emerged from the electoral process unexpectedly strengthened, with more votes ... and more deputies"", the analyst believes its theoretical chances of building a coalition are virtually impossible to become reality. Sanchez would need the support of both parties that are in favour of Catalonia's independence and he cannot afford the ""serious concessions"" this would entail.

Lisjak Gabrijelčič added that ""powerful circles within the country, such as the king, the top bureaucracy and the Chamber of Commerce, have been appealing and quietly lobbying for a grand coalition for years"". In his view, this would suit Feijoo, which had not been the case with previous PP presidents.

But a grand coalition seems quite distant at the moment, because both the PP and the PSOE are clearly aware that such an alliance would again lead to the strengthening of other radical competitors. According to the analyst, a grand coalition scenario however should not be discounted in the case of a potential new snap election.

In Lijsak Gabrijelčič's view, both sides are already starting to prepare for this eventuality - especially Feijoo, who is stressing the need for stability and is working to strengthen his position and further marginalise the far-right Vox. The latter, however, maintains its voter base despite its weaker position after the elections.",politics
Athletes helping victims of devastating floods,"Slovenian athletes, including basketball superstar Luka Dončić, are among those that have jumped in to help people affected by the worst flooding in Slovenia's history. ""We are committed to helping in every way,"" The Luka Dončić Foundation has announced.","""The Luka Dončić Foundation is heartbroken by the catastrophic flooding that continues to ravage neighbourhoods, destroy homes, and claim lives in Slovenia,"" Dončić's charity foundation said in a message posted to its Instagram profile on Saturday.

""We are in touch with local authorities to support their relief efforts and will continue to respond to their needs as the situation unfolds,"" it added, expressing gratitude to the firefighters and all the first responders on the ground, who are risking their lives to help those most affected.

""Our heart is with all the people of Slovenia who lost their homes and lives in the floods. We are committed to helping in every way,"" the message reads.

Support for the people affected by the floods has also been provided by pro rider Matej Mohorič. Most recently Mohorič secured the overall victory at the Tour of Poland on Friday, announcing that he will dedicate the prize money toward the flood relief effort.

Franjo Bobinac, the head of the Slovenian Olympic Committee, has appealed to members of the Olympic family to join in the effort to help those in need.

""Some sports organisations and owners of sports infrastructure have responded, providing various forms of aid to the best of their abilities. Everyone who is in need of assistance during these catastrophic events, let us know. We will try to help the best we can,"" Bobinac wrote.",disaster and accident
Slovenia deems another extension of border checks by Austria unacceptable,"Slovenia's Foreign Ministry labelled as unacceptable Austria's decision to extend by yet another six months border checks along the countries' shared border. The response comes after the European Commission said earlier today that internal border checks were an extraordinary measure, and strictly limited in duration.","Austria first introduced border checks at the height of the migration crisis in 2015 and has been extending the measure by six months ever since.

Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told the public radio Ö1 today that border checks along the border with Slovenia and Hungary had to be extended because of significant migratory pressure due to ineffective external border control.

The Slovenian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs expressed regret over Austria's decision. ""This action is unacceptable, which is something Slovenia has been pointing out to Austria and the relevant institutions for a long time.

""When Austria forwards to the European Commission its official reasoning for the extension of checks along the internal border within the Schengen zone we will respond appropriately,"" the ministry said in a statement for the STA.

In 2021, the European Court of Justice ruled that internal border checks can only be introduced in the face of serious threat to public order or internal security of a member state. However, the measure must not exceed six months.

This is also the view of the European Commission, which said today that internal border checks must remain an extraordinary measure, strictly limited in duration, and a last resort.",politics
Justice minister says govt and judges close to pay deal,"Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan hopes judges and prosecutors will not resort to work-to-rule, saying the two sides are close to reaching a deal after pay in the judiciary and prosecution has not been raised ""for more than ten years"", she said in an interview the news site Siol ran on Sunday.","Although judges are aware that a strike is the last resort, ""some courts have already said they would start a slowdown"", which means ""slowly reducing the scope of work.""

Švarc Pipan said there had also been ideas to adopt the pace judges have during the judicial recess in the summer, ""meaning handling only the most urgent cases"".

""Judges and prosecutors are really up in arms"" after keeping silent all this time when other public sector trade unions secured pay raises, she said.

The minster did not disclose any details about the pay deal beyond saying the plan is ""for the pay reform to apply to judges and prosecutors already as of 2024"" rather than by 2027 when it would kick in for other public office holders.

She said the pay issue was being addressed as a priority, although she noted ""the public not being in favour of the judges' demands for higher pay"".

She believes the public misunderstands the profession, the current pay situation and the role an adequate pay arrangement has for the protection of independence as the key principle of judiciary. ""The same goes for prosecutors.""

The government drafted a bill to add EUR 600 gross a month to the judges and prosecutors' pay as a stop gap measure before the pay reform is implemented, but withdrew it over concerns that it may not be in line with the constitution.

As for the bottlenecks in the judiciary, Švarc Pipan pointed to administrative and criminal proceedings, family disputes, and cases at the Constitutional Court.

""Compared to before, caseload has started piling up in these areas. Proceedings are slower, courts are not as good at managing the caseload as in previous years.""

The shortage of staff in the judiciary and prosecution is another systemic problem, with low pay one of the obvious reasons for it, she said.

Among the new legislation the minister plans to have ready this year is a bill to introduce a kind of a universal judge.

This means first-instance judges would no longer be classified as local or district court judges, but could be sent to work at any first-instance court where needed the most. ""This would enable more flexibility in assigning cases, including in case of bottlenecks,"" she said.

The minister added that views on such a judge had converged in recent years and ""the majority of judges and the judiciary now support it"".","crime, law and justice"

"Cooperation of North Adriatic ports successful, but with room for improvement","The North Adriatic Ports Association (NAPA), which was set up 13 years ago and brings together five ports from Italy, Slovenia and Croatia, has achieved its objectives since container traffic has more than doubled in this period. There is however room to grow further, and to improve infrastructure, heard a logistics conference on Thursday.","Andrej Cah, the director of sales at the port of Koper, said the reason why the North Adriatic is seeing constant growth in cargo volumes is that the ports have adapted their infrastructure to larger container ships in time.

A decade ago they could accept ships with 6,000 container units (TEUs) at most, now they can handle ships with 15,000 TEUs, he said. In the coming years it is realistic to expect that ships with 20,000 TEUs and more will be able to dock.

Growth is driven primarily by the relocation of industry from west to east Europe, which is the natural hinterland for Koper, and shipping companies recognising the benefits of rerouting ships from the North Sea to the Adriatic through the Suez Canal.

However, there are still regions, for example Bavaria, south Poland, north Czechia and east Romania, for which Koper is the closest port yet they still use North Sea ports.

One port cannot handle all of this potential cargo, it has to be shared. And in order to do that, the North Adriatic ports need to offer customers reliable door-to-door services, according to Cah.

This involves improving piloting services, deepening the ports, improving digitalisation and automation, and increasing warehousing areas, both around ports and inland, he said.

Zeno D'Agostino, the chairman of the Port Network Authority of the Eastern Adriatic Sea, said there was already a single information system for the Trieste port, Ronchi airport, cargo terminals in Fernetti, Cervignano, Gorizia and Pordenone, and the Dolina industrial zone.

As a result, the Trieste port does not have waiting lines since containers are waiting for transshipment at 11 inland locations and there are regular trains; more than half of all cargo is already transported by rail, he said.

Ivić Vodopija, East Adriatic managing director at AP Moller Maersk Group, meanwhile warned that the route through the Suez Canal is shorter but not faster, and that large container ships do not dock at North Adriatic ports full.

There is insufficient rail capacity and trains are too short. Warehouses are full, procedures are inefficient and IT insufficient, he said, adding that it was good NAPA existed but states should also cooperate better, not just ports.

Similarly, Peter Kiss, the CEO of Czech rail shipping company Metrans, said problems with infrastructure and rail traffic organisation needed to be resolved, it is not enough for politicians to talk about shifting cargo from roads to rail.

And Bine Štancar, general manager for the Adriatic cluster at shipping company CMA CGM, added that NAPA cooperates well in promotion and in winning EU funds, but there should be more operational cooperation between the ports, including a single IT system that would also include railways.

The debate was held at the annual International Logistics Congress in Portorož, which is organised by the Slovenian Logistics Association.","economy, business and finance"
Govt to soon decide on who needs to leave home following floods,Head of the government's reconstruction service Boštjan Šefic announced on Tuesday in the wake of criticism from affected families that answers about which damaged homes need to be torn down as a result of the August floods would be provided by the government within two weeks. He noted that the bill on reconstruction was still being coordinated.,"Addressing the press after grievances and protest announcements coming from affected areas in the heavily hit Upper Savinja Valley, such as Luče and Struge, Šefic said helping individuals, especially in housing reconstruction, would be the priority of the government's post-flood reconstruction service over the next two weeks.

""We have some very difficult decisions ahead of us, which we will formulate and make together with municipal leaders and present to the locals,"" Šefic said about the fate of those who may need to leave their homes due to the peril of landslides or new floods.

The procedures for possible replacement construction will be defined by the reconstruction bill. It will be important to find suitable land, with several types of construction possible, depending on the area. Those affected will be able to move permanently or only rent temporarily.

Šefic announced that measures in the reconstruction bill were likely to be implemented over a five-year period.

Things that need to be outlined include procedures for alternative housing, support for farmers, alternative farms, the management of debris and silt, as well as flood protection measures, and the construction of permanent bridges where temporary solutions have been secured so far.

Faced with criticism that the government was moving too slowly, the reconstruction service has decided to present its work at weekly press conferences.

An overview has been made available on the web at poplave2023.evode.si of worksites on watercourses, with Water Agency director Neža Kodre explaining intensive operations were still ongoing on many major sites.

To date, emergency watercourses measures have been concluded at 466 sites covering 33 kilometres, some of which were extremely challenging. Work is currently underway at 206 sites, with around 1,000 machines operating on the ground along with 500 additional workers.

There have so far been EUR 47 million approved from the state budget and EUR 15.5 million spent on emergency measures on watercourses.

Other funding from the state budget has included EUR 10 million for the Red Cross and Caritas, EUR 18.1 million for emergency welfare payments, EUR 14.1 million for emergency measures costs in 138 municipalities (with EUR 95 million still outstanding), EUR 76.1 million in advance payments for damage to municipal infrastructure (EUR 145.9 million still outstanding), and EUR 31.8 million in advances for damage to businesses.",labour

Special fund planned to finance post-flood reconstruction,"The government plans to set up a special fund to finance reconstruction works after Slovenia's worst floods in living memory. It will pool together budget funds, EU funds and other financial sources, Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič told the press after Thursday's government session.","Called the Slovenian Reconstruction Fund - the Slovenian acronym will be SOS - it will not be set up under the emergency bill the government adopted today, instead it will by the subject of a forthcoming systemic law that will deal with the long-term reconstruction of the flood-hit areas.

Boštjančič said it will be modelled on similar funds set up by other countries. The main reason why the government has opted for such a solution is compliance with EU rules on borrowing, more specifically the impact of such funds on the budget deficit.

The minister could not yet reveal the details, but unofficial information reported by several media indicates that the fund would manage around EUR 3 billion.",disaster and accident
New commercial zone opens in Kidričevo,"A new commercial zone was inaugurated in Kidričevo near Ptuj on Monday by Mayor Anton Leskovar and Economy Minister Matjaž Han. The municipality has received more than EUR 2 million in EU grants for the EUR 4 million project, while the Economy Ministry chipped in almost EUR 700,000.","As part of the project, which is in line with a strategy on regional development, all the utilities, transport, electricity and telecommunications infrastructure was built by Cestno Podjetje Ptuj. The new western bypass will be officially open in mid-June.

Leskovar said there were many good businesses in the area, so the municipality was trying to give them a chance to expand.

The new 25-hectare commercial zone is expected to expand to degraded areas quickly, as 20 hectares of the land have already been taken by various businesses, mostly logistic companies, pool manufacturers and various other companies, which will also require workforce.

An intermodal logistics centre is also planned as the zone is located just next to the motorway and railway. Leskovar said the construction could start in this term.

Minister Han said the investment was not important just for Kidričevo but also for the entire region due to its geostrategic location. He expressed support for the future projects of the municipality and the aluminium producer Talum Group, the municipality's largest employer.

CEO Marko Drobnič said that Talum's industrial zone still offered about 50 hectares of industrial plots and together with the new commercial zone this was the best equipped industrial area in the country and a great opportunity for development.

The new western bypass will redirect Talum's cargo transport from Kidričevo and Hajdina, so it is also important for the local community, he said.

Expressing support for the plans for the intermodal centre, he said that Talum and the nearby Impol, Slovenia's largest aluminium producer, planned to build a development centre for advanced light technologies aimed at increasing the use of light metals, and were also hoping for support from the state.","economy, business and finance"
Defence Committee discusses UAVs and air defence systems,"The parliamentary Defence Committee discussed on Wednesday the proposed 2023 supplementary budget for defence, which raises spending by EUR 2.7 million. The MPs were also acquainted with investments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and air defence systems.","Defence Ministry State Secretary Damir Črnčec told the committee that the supplementary budget contributed to the strategic goal of raising defence spending to 2% of Slovenia's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.

He noted that 20% of the defence budget would go for key investments in equipment, which did not include investments in infrastructure and facilities.

With the 2023 supplementary budget, defence spending is being raised from EUR 976.6 million to EUR 979.3 million, Črnčec said, noting that this was 6.1% of the entire budget.

EUR 731 million is intended for the Slovenian Armed Forces, and EUR 107.5 million for the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration, with the latter getting more funds compared to previous years, he said.

This clearly indicates that the Defence Ministry is not only investing in weapons, Črnčec said, adding that the goal was also to allocate 2% of the defence budget to research, development and innovation in 2023.

Opposition Democrats (SDS) deputy Žan Mahnič was interested in the development of Slovenian unmanned aerial vehicles, with Črnčec replying that a delegation of EU Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton had visited in April the company Timtec Defense, which is owned by Slovenian entrepreneur Ivo Boscarol.

The state secretary is convinced that the result of the first phase of the development of a unmanned aerial combat vehicle by this company will be presented to the public as early as this year.

Črnčec also announced that Slovenia will join emerging European projects to strengthen the European defence industry, which had been discussed during Breton's visit to Slovenia last month.

Another company with which the ministry cooperates well is C-Astral, whose aircraft observed last year's massive wildfire in the western region of Kras, he added.

Another development-oriented project that he mentioned is a public-private partnership to construct a solar power plant in the Kranj barracks, which is also to produce hydrogen as fuel for military and local public passenger transport vehicles.

Asked by Milan Jakopovič of the coalition Left why the supplementary budget did not envisage the purchase of air defence systems, Črnčec noted that these systems could not be ordered and received quickly.

This is because all European countries are updating such systems due to the Russo-Ukrainian war, he said, adding that the ministry nevertheless considered the purchase of such systems as priority.","economy, business and finance"
"President for more food self-sufficiency, less red tape in climate measures","President Nataša Pirc Musar called for improving self-sufficiency in food, and reducing red tape for measures designed to prevent the increasingly frequent extreme weather events, as she visited fruit and vegetables producer Evrosad in Krško, east, on Tuesday to get briefed on the state of self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruit.","The president stressed that extreme weather events are not a matter of the future. Given all the natural disasters taking place, action is needed now.

She pointed to sprinkling of fruit trees to protect them from spring frosts, protection against hail, and irrigation, which is a must in droughts.

All of these measures were presented to her at Evrosad, which its director Boštjan Kozole said had only been slightly affected by last week's extremely thick hailstorm.

The president believes that more should be done in Slovenia to tackle climate change.

She announced that overly bureaucratic procedures for the introduction of these measures will be discussed at her forum in October.

As for Slovenia's fruit self-sufficiency, she said it was 53% in 2015, and then started ""drastically falling"" due to crises in the global markets to hit 21% in 2021 and return to 29% in 2022. ""It's extremely important that we start to move slowly towards 50% and to better food sovereignty,"" she told the press.

Kozole echoed the president's view on the need to take adequate measures to fight the climate change and to pursue an active approach.

He too pointed to lengthy and complicated procedures to obtain all the necessary permits to introduce these measures.

He cited the example of Western European countries where everything can be sorted out at ""one-stop shops"" and much more quickly than in Slovenia.

Krško Mayor Janez Kerin told the press that last week's storms damaged 430 hectares of agricultural land in his municipality.

Pirc Musar also visited Evrosad's market place, with which the company strengthened cooperation with local Posavje farmers to shorten supply chains.

Evrosad used to be the largest producer of high-quality Slovenian fruit that exported two thirds of it, but has in recent years increasingly focussed on the domestic market, and on the production of various fruits and vegetables, as well as potatoes.",weather

Defence spending in 2021-2022 reaches over EUR 190 million,"The Defence Ministry spent EUR 192 million on military purchases in 2021 and 2022, or around 25% of the EUR 780 million available under the law on funds for investments in the Slovenian army in the six-year period between 2021 and 2026, heard the parliamentary Defence Committee on Thursday.","In 2022, the ministry bought a Spartan aircraft for EUR 50 million, EUR 14.3 million went for Boxer APCs, of which EUR 11.3 million for radio equipment, while EUR 3 million was paid in administrative fees as part of the OCCAR programme, Željko Kralj from the ministry told the MPs.

Light APCs cost EUR 19 million, ICT for cyber defence EUR 7.2 million, the warrior equipment project EUR 10.4 million, weapons and equipment for special forces EUR 1.5 million, and the Spike anti-tank guided missile systems cost EUR 4 million.

Maintenance works at Poček, the army's main training area, cost EUR 5.5 million, with most of the funds going for the shooting range Bač.

Technical equipment worth EUR 839,000 was bought for a shooting range at Apače, for which the ministry has obtained a building permit, said Kralj, head of the ministry's logistics directorate.

Miha Kordiš, an MP for the Left, protested against the purchases, saying they are carried out based on the law, passed under the previous government, against which his party collected 30,000 signatures for a referendum when it was still in opposition, while the new government coalition pledged to amend it.

Contrary to Kordiš, Miroslav Gregorič from the ruling party Freedom Movement praised the successful spending of the funds from the ministry's budget.

He hopes the sum will further increase by at least 25% from this year to hit around EUR 150 million, urging purchases of anti-ballistic radar and missile systems.

Gregorič also supports launching mass production of modular bridges, saying Slovenian had the industry that would be up to such a project.

Similarly, opposition MP Matej Tonin from New Slovenia (NSi) welcomed the investments, saying the army had been the first victim of the past financial crises.

Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said that all of the army's key projects were there to stay, and so was a commitment to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP until 2030.

""We'll never be in a situation where Slovenia is an untrustworthy NATO member and expects others to do everything for us,"" he stressed.

The ministry will contribute to the solidarity post-flood reconstruction fund, but the commitment to key projects from the resolution on the development of the Slovenian Armed Forces is not at stake, he said.

This is in response to media reports that the army will contribute EUR 215 million for post-flood reconstruction until 2025, at the expense of its modernisation.",sport
Goran Forbici appointed head of new RTV council,"The new, 17-member governing council at the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija met for its first session on Monday and appointed Goran Forbici, a representative of the general public, its president with 15 votes.","Forbici, the director of the CNVOS centre of Slovenian NGOs, had been put forward to serve on the council by the country's Ombudsman of Human Rights.

His deputy will be Špela Stare, secretary general of the Slovenian Association of Journalists (DNS), who had been put forward by the Information Commissioner upon the DNS's proposal.

The pair are two of the 11 council members representing the general public, while the remaining six come from the RTV staff.

Today's session comes after the Constitutional Court lifted on 26 May its February stay of the new RTV Slovenija legislation while the final decision on its constitutionality is yet to be reached.

The RTV Slovenija Council replaces the broadcaster's programme council and the supervisory board as part of an overhaul of management and oversight at the broadcaster.

One of the council's first tasks will be appointing a four-member management board and a five-member consultative financial board, both introduced by the changes to the RTV Slovenija Act, which entered into force in December.","crime, law and justice"
Mladina sees Golob's arrogance shaking entire government,"Mladina argues that PM Robert Golob, having taken the path from messianic arrogance to impotent self-pity like most of his predecessors, is falsely reasoning that his drop in popularity is related to reforms and not to his steamroller attitude and to his inability to fulfil his many unrealistic promises.","Taking apart Golob's statements about the government possibly giving up on all reforms apart from health reform, the weekly paper says ""we better not think of the sentiments of people who have been working feverishly for months on public sector pay reform, tax reform, pension reform and, of course, long-term care reform"".

Golob's criticism of the Finance Ministry as his support rating fell below 50% led to the resignation of the ministry's State Secretary Tilen Božič, a true expert on taxes. While one state secretary cannot really rattle the government, ""the very thing that we have been warning about is in fact happening"".

If Golob does not start to prefer thinking over talking and fails to grasp that holding power is about more than brute force and will, the government is facing a bleak future, Mladina says in the commentary entitled From Pahor to Golob.

Repeating Golob has surrounded himself with people that are not smart but amateurs who are not up to their task and who are foremost about political intrigues and sowing discord, Mladina is not sure the PM is capable of changing course. It also fears that the only reform that is really on track could in fact lead to the privatisation of healthcare.

""High politics is a craft, but it is also a chess game that is about seeing five moves ahead and overcoming reactions and obstacles. It is a calm and subtle business that has no need for shouty and know-it-all social climbers. Professionalism and personal integrity are its pillars. And it is these pillars that Golob himself has rattled or perhaps even already shattered.""",politics

Zavarovalnica Triglav proposes EUR 2.50 dividend for last year,"The management of the insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav will propose at the 6 June AGM a dividend payout for last year of EUR 2.50 gross per share, or a total of EUR 56.8 million. Slightly more than half of net profit of the Triglav group for 2022 would be allocated for dividends, which represents a 6% dividend yield.","Announcing the proposal on Tuesday, Zavarovalnica Triglav said that the proposal exceeded investors' expectations regarding the average 4.3% dividend yield of shares of European insurance companies this year.

While labelling the proposed dividend as ""attractive"", chairman Andrej Slapar was also quoted as saying that the dividend policy nevertheless enabled the Triglav group to sustain medium-term financial stability, further growth and development.

While 2022 was challenging, the group achieved good results and exceeded plans, which was also a result of certain one-off events.

The management and supervisory boards of the insurer have assessed that the company would be able to maintain in the medium term the appropriate level of capital adequacy, which expectedly decreased last year.

The dividend proposal takes into account the estimated current and expected future operating conditions of the group, the anticipated capital needs and the ability of the group to achieve its strategic goals, the release adds.

Zavarovalnica Triglav is expected to publish on 21 April the call for the regular AGM, which is scheduled for 6 June.

Last year, the Triglav group had EUR 1.6 billion in revenue, 10% more than in 2021. Its pre-tax profit was up by 1% to EUR 134.5 million, while net profit dropped by 2% to EUR 110.2 million.","economy, business and finance"

President assesses army capable of defending Slovenia,"President Nataša Pirc Musar received on Friday the army readiness report for 2022, which points to certain deviations from standards. Nevertheless, Pirc Musar, the commander-in-chief of the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF), is convinced that the force is capable of defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Slovenia.","The president noted that ""there are still certain deviations in terms of the capabilities, operation and endurance of the defence forces,"" while adding that steps were being taken in a positive direction.

Pirc Musar stressed that the SAF had carried out all the required tasks - training and exercises, providing support for other authorities, including the police and protection and rescue teams, while also participating in the planned international missions.

She also mention in this context the recently passed resolution for the further development of the SAF until 2040, which will span over the terms of several governments.

Pirc Musar noted that the share of GDP allocated for defence spending was being raised, and within it the share for investment, innovation and research, which is important from the aspect of modern threats and breakthrough and dual-use technologies.

The president said that progress had also been made in training as the key task of the SAF for the defence of the country, and greater attention was also being paid to cyber defence capabilities.

On the other hand, the age structure of the SAF and recruitment of new members remain a challenge.

Also being addressed is the delay in the creation of key capacities, which will not be reduced overnight since this requires time and, above all, stable political support, the president noted.

Pirc Musar is nevertheless convinced that the ""Slovenian army, in cooperation with other entities and resources, will protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Slovenia, if necessary.""

In this regard, the president said Slovenia must be prepared for changed international circumstances. ""Adequate equipment, readiness and the ability to detect, prevent and respond to modern security threats"" is the only way to ensure national security.

She assessed that following the development of breakthrough technologies in a timely manner would be a challenging task for all stakeholders in national security, noting that a lag in this respect would be constitute serious security vulnerability.

""This is why we need appropriate defence capabilities, which must be regularly upgraded and modernised, and which must be intended for national defence and, of course, for the needs of NATO,"" Pirc Musar concluded.

The report was presented to the president by Defence Minister Marjan Šarec and Maj-Gen Robert Glavaš, the chief of the general staff of the SAF.",science and technology
Visitor numbers at Lipica stud farm improving this year,"The operator of the Kobilarna Lipica stud farm is happy with the visitor number for this year so far, as it is more than 10% higher than in the same period last year, when around 70,000 visitors were recorded. With the majority of the guests coming from nearby European countries, the stud farm is making the effort to encourage them to stay longer.","""Most of the visitors stay at the stud farm no longer than a day, which we would like to change,"" Kobilarna Lipica director Tatjana Vošinek Pucer told the STA on Wednesday.

She said that while the influx of guests in summertime is high, the stud farm needs to find new ways of attracting people in wintertime by offering them more leisure time activities.

""We are very happy because we had many individual guests this summer, a lot of them regulars. Seeing as we are located along the route that leads to and from the seaside, we need to put more effort towards keeping our hotel booked over winter too,"" she said.

Like in the previous years, the majority of guests this year came from German-speaking countries and Italy. The number of visitors from Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland also keeps increasing.

The stud farm that is the home of the world-famous Lipizzan white horses expects that the number of visitors by the end of the year will also be up by some 10% compared to last year. ""We hope to see the same growth in revenue,"" the director said.

With this goal in mind, Kobilarna Lipica wants to improve the range of activities and services to encourage visitors to prolong their stay. A swimming pool has been planned for years, with the documents for construction having been drawn up, but work will be delayed by at least a year.

The stud farm will carry out another major investment this year by completely renovating the indoor riding arena after 40 years.

The investment, worth around EUR 2 million, will notably improve training conditions and the comfort of visitors who come to see shows staged by the Lipica Riding School. Vošinek Pucer said the renovated arena is to open by the end of the year.",sport

Sweden's Zero8 wins Gallus choir competition,"Swedish choir Zero8 has won the 17th Gallus international choir competition that wrapped up in Maribor on Sunday. Basque's male ensemble Suhar finished second, and the third place went to the Slovenian chamber choir Megaron, which also received the award for best Slovenian ensemble.","Eight choirs from Europe, Asia and the Americas took part in the three-day competition, including six mixed ensembles and two men's choirs, the Slovenian Public Fund for Cultural Activities said.

Having won the Gallus-Maribor grand prize, Zero8 is now one of the finalists for the European equivalent of the accolade, which will be presented in Varna, Bulgaria, in September.

""The acoustics of the Union Hall are exceptionally good. The echoes do not last too long, but they are still just right, enveloping us like a ring. Every time we stood on the stage, we said: We love this place,"" Zero8 choirmaster Rasmus Krigström commented on the competition's venue.

Founded in 2007, the Stockholm-based male choir is known for its award-winning take on barbershop genre. Since 2008 they have won many gold medals at all Nordic and European barbershop competitions, and placed third at the 2019 International Barbershop Championships in Salt Lake City, US.

New restrictions in place for disgraced Slovenian Jesuit,"The Jesuit order has decided to prohibit Slovenian priest Marko Rupnik from pursuing his artistic activity after 15 more people, women as well as men, came forward with fresh accusations against him of spiritual, sexual and psychological abuse.","In a report published on Tuesday morning, Johan Verschueren, Rupnik's superior in the religious order, said that a number of people who do not know each other had come forward with similar accusations against the priest, which led to the conclusion that the allegations were ""very credible"".

As a precautionary measure, the order has tightened the restrictive rules against Rupnik by banning him from any public artistic exercise, particularly in relation to religious structures.

These new restrictions are in addition to those already in place, including a ban on any public ministerial and sacramental activity, a ban on public communication, and a ban on leaving the Lazio Region.

The Rupnik scandal, which first came to light at the end of last year, has rocked the Jesuit order and the entire Catholic Church given that Pope Francis is a member of the order.

Rupnik has not spoken publicly about the accusations and Verschueren said in his latest update that he has declined to meet Jesuit investigators.

An artist specialising in mosaics, Rupnik rose to prominence when the late Pope John Paul II commissioned him to redesign a chapel in the Vatican between 1996 to 1999. He has since designed numerous chapels around the world.

Father Rupnik's misconduct took place between the mid-1980s and 2018, according to the latest testimony by victims.",religion and belief

""Already now it is one of the top partners of Slovenia's economy. Its excellence and future potential make us want to deepen our business cooperation,"" said Han.

Trade between Slovenia and Lombardy reached a record EUR 3.23 billion last year, an increase of 28% over 2021. Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Friuli Venezia Giulia account for 75% of Slovenia's trade with Italy, the ministry said.

Han wants to see cooperation boosted in space technologies, in regards to which Slovenia and Italy have signed a letter of intent for cooperation in peaceful use of space.

The minister also sees potential in wood industry, with Italy, and above all Lombardy, being Slovenia's most important export partner. There is also potential in circular economy and medicine, said Han.

""These are fields that are important to both Lombardy and Slovenia, therefore we want to strengthen existing ties and build new as well,"" said Han.

Fontana said that relations between Slovenia and Lombardy were very good, adding that he and Han had also discussed political topics and found that they have shared views on many of them.

MPs call for better accessibility of public buildings for disabled,"After debating a special report submitted by Human Rights Ombudsman on social work centres' accessibility for people with physical and sensory disabilities, which has revealed a number of issues, MPs unanimously backed a recommendation on Thursday for a comprehensive strategy to improve accessibility of public buildings for everyone.","The strategy is to be drafted by the Labour Ministry and the social work centres within 90 days. They are also to draft a report on the activities so far.

The ombudsman launched an inquiry on selected aspects of accessibility for the physically disabled in March 2021 and another inquiry on accessibility for the sensory impaired in January 2022 to find the situation in certain cases alarming.

There are 63 social work centres in Slovenia, some of which operate in several facilities. Only a quarter of all social work centres were found to be accessible, while 18 did not have adequate sanitary facilities so people with reduced mobility had no choice but to use toilets at a nearby gas station or a community health centre.

Svetina stressed this was inadmissible and showed how the state and heads of certain social work centres treat the issue with indifference.

He also said the current situation was even worse for those with sensory impairments. None of the units provide for a hearing loop system, Braille signs and inscriptions, monitors showing written-out information, or video players with the information subtitled or in sign language.

The Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Ministry responded by saying it had already taken on the issue actively, and that some improvements had been made since 2021.

All of the centres have been prompted to take action and prepare status reports. The existing rules and regulations will be reviewed, after which the ministry will prepare an action plan together with disability organizations and the Association of Social Work Centres to systematically eradicate irregularities in all units.

Debating the issue, deputy groups unanimously noted that relevant legislation has to be reviewed and implemented so that no social group is discriminated against or denied access to services.

Coalition parties said that the relevant ministry had done a good job up to this point in adopting inclusive solutions and policies, while the opposition noted that social work centres provided help to the most vulnerable social groups so people with physical or sensory impairments not having access to such services was a serious problem and a violation of human rights.

They view the ombudsman's report as a clear signal for decision-makers to put more effort in implementing legislation and keeping with the deadlines, which are clearly set out.

The relevant act stipulates that public buildings must be adapted by 2025 at the latest or immediately if the building is being renovated. This field is under the watch of the construction inspectorate.",social issue
Foreign Ministry urges Moscow to reconsider grain deal suspension,"Russia's decision to suspend the international agreement on the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea will have consequences for the most vulnerable in Africa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs (MFA) has warned on Twitter, urging Moscow to reconsider its decision so that an a deterioration in food security is averted.","The ministry also pointed out in Tuesday's statement that Slovenia is actively contributing to the Black Sea Grain Initiative with a donation of EUR 1 million. It is moreover preparing a new aid package.

The ministry also retweeted Monday's statement by EU High Representative Josep Borrell, who condemned on behalf of the EU Russia's termination of the initiative.

Borrell warned that Russia is further exacerbating the global food security crisis it created and added that Russia must cease illegally blocking Ukrainian sea ports and allow freedom of navigation on the Black Sea.

On Monday, Russia withdrew from the agreement on grain exports via the Black Sea until further notice. It is ready to resume cooperation as soon as the required conditions are met, it explained. These include the removal of barriers to Russian grain and fertiliser exports and the resumption of Russian ammonia exports.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed the safe export of nearly 33 million tonnes of grain and foodstuffs to 45 countries by over one thousand vessels. This includes considerable amount of 725,000 tonnes of grain shipped by vessels chartered by the World Food Programme in support of its humanitarian operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen, Borrell pointed out.

""All this is at risk now. Russia continues weaponizing food. By terminating the agreements, Russia is single-handedly blocking one of the crucial main export routes from Ukraine of grains for human consumption and is solely responsible for disruptions of grain deliveries worldwide and fuelling food price inflation globally,"" Borrell wrote.

Thus the EU urged Russia to reconsider its decision and immediately resume implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. ""The EU will continue to support all efforts towards the resumption of the Black Sea Grain Initiative,"" the statement reads.",environmental issue

"At EUR 200m in 2022, Intereuropa's sales highest in last ten years","The logistics group Intereuropa generated EUR 200.4 million in sales revenue last year, which is 13% more than in 2021 and the highest figure in the last ten years. Net profit was meanwhile down by 22.7% to EUR 5.1 million, show the unaudited results released on Thursday.","Intereuropa said that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were up by 9% to EUR 15.1 million, and operating profit (EBIT) by 12% to EUR 8.2 million.

The company noted that ""2022 was characterised by significantly increased uncertainty in the international environment, linked to the war in Ukraine, the tightening of energy markets and rising prices.""

Nevertheless, the group generated its highest sales revenue in the last ten years and highest operating profit and operating cash flow over the same period, the press release adds.

The sales revenue of EUR EUR 200.4 million was 15% higher than planned, as sales exceeded the plan in all segments, with intercontinental transport performing the best in absolute terms.

The net profit was EUR 0.3 million lower than planned, which Intereuropa attributed to an increase in expenses for current and deferred corporate income tax, which amounted to EUR 1.9 million in 2022, or EUR 1.3 million more than in 2021.

The group's net debt at the end of 2022 amounted to EUR 42.5 million, up EUR 6.8 million on the end of the previous year.

Reporter wonders why Russian spy story got to the press,"The weekly Reporter comments on the arrest of two alleged Russian spies in Ljubljana in December, wondering how the news got to the press. Resulting from a tip from a foreign intelligence agency, the arrest was not the great success it was described by the government, the paper says.","Under the headline Russian Cell from Črnuče, the magazine wonders why the story got into the press at all, implying it was leaked as a way to show that Slovenia was a strong link in the anti-Putin coalition.

Reporter finds it interesting that the news was leaked only after the report about the arrests had been sent to the parliamentary Commission for the Oversight of Intelligence and Security Services, wondering whether it came from a commission member, ""allegedly an MP of New Slovenia"".

""He has not necessarily done this of his own accord, maybe he got a tip from the government that this were beneficial for Slovenia.""

The paper is surprised that Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon had not summoned Russian Ambassador Timur Eyvazov and that Prime Minister Robert Golob had not called a meeting of the National Security Council, saying the matter was quickly left by the wayside, leaving many questions unanswered.

Slovenia is not as unimportant to Russia as it might seem, Report says. Not only is it easy to follow other countries from here, Russia is also interested in Slovenia's critical infrastructure.

Moreover, it is no success that the intelligence service arrested the suspected spies after they had been in Slovenia for six years. The paper wonders how many foreign spies have gone unnoticed and notes that Russian spies might have infiltrated the intelligence service as well.","crime, law and justice"

Slovenian arrested over threats of terror attack on pro-Palestine rally,Ljubljana police arrested a 20-year-old Slovenian citizen after the organisers of yesterday's rally in support of the Palestinian people received threats of a terror attack.,"The man was apprehended over suspicion of terrorism soon after the organisers notified the police of the written threats they had received, the Ljubljana Police Department said on Friday.

An investigation is ongoing, so the police could not provide more details beyond saying that the suspect had no prior run-ins with the police.

The police department will provide more details at a news conference scheduled for 2pm.","crime, law and justice"
"Heavy rainfall triggers dozens of landslides, many danger to homes","After over a week of permanent rainfall, the heavy rain that hit the eastern half of Slovenia on Tuesday triggered dozens of landslides, many of which are a danger to homes and infrastructure. The situation is worst around the town of Šentilj in the northeast, where the military is arriving to help the local responders. Rain is slowly petering out.","Nearly 70 landslides have been triggered, requiring the activation of 47 firefighting units, according to data from the public safety answering points (PSAP) system.

Firefighters were called to help due to heavy rainfall in PSAPs of Ptuj, Maribor, Celje, Murska Sobota and Novo Mesto. Some 350 events were recorded, requiring the activation of 187 firefighting units to pump water from basements, secure buildings with sandbags or manage landslides with the help of tarps and by arranging drainage.

A number of roads in the northeast are closed or run only alternately due to landslides. Virtually all waterways in the eastern half of the country have swelled.

The situation is now calming down and the water will gradually withdraw, only the Mura and Krka are still expected to peak downstream before returning into their beds. Most waterways have spilled only across their usual flood plains.

The situation is worst in the area between Šentilj, on Slovenia's border with Austria, and Ormož, a town on the border with Croatia, some 50 kilometres southeast of Šentilj.

In Šentilj alone, 12 homes are in danger because of landslides, many of them hard to reach because of damaged roads. The local Civil Protection units expect the military to arrive in this morning.

Soldiers will help ""everywhere where roads are damaged, but before that they will help where there are houses in danger,"" Šentilj Civil Protection head Valentina Ošlovnik said.

It was still raining in Šentilj this morning, but the rain is expected to cease today. It will remain cloudy tomorrow, but it will be mostly dry. Local showers are forecast for Friday afternoon and Saturday.",disaster and accident
Slovenia bags 13 medals in European Games,"Slovenian athletes won 13 medals at the 3rd European Games that took place in Krakow, Poland, between 21 June and 2 July. The most successful among them was kickboxing competitor Tyra Barada, who won a gold and a silver medal.","Slovenia won three gold, eight silver and two bronze medals, ranking 21st according to the total number of medals.

The country won two more medals than at the first two European Games in Baku and Minsk combined, but it is impossible to compare the 2015, 2019 and 2023 achievements because the latest Games had the highest number of sports ever and the disciplines were different from the first two events.

In addition to Barada, another two kickboxing competitors, Urška Gazvoda and Tina Baloh, each won a silver medal. Also on form were ski jumpers, with Nika Križnar winning gold, Nika Prevc two silver medals and the mixed team, made up of the two plus Anže Lanišek and Timi Zajc, bringing home a bronze medal.

Two schools in Trbovlje secured due to threatening mail,"The police have secured two primary schools in Trbovlje in central Slovenia as it received a threatening e-mail on Thursday, which is believed to be motivated by Wednesday's school shooting in the Serbian capital of Belgrade.","According to the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija, police officers were dispatched in front of the Trbovlje primary school and its local branch after the school received the threatening e-mail.

The school's head teacher Petra Čede said that she had informed the parents that the school had received an inappropriate e-mail, as had been the case several times before, and that the relevant authorities had been informed about the incident.

The schools have been secured and classes and other activities are being performed as usual, but some 10% of the students have not attended today's classes.

Čede told the STA that additional measures had been taken, expressing the hope that the threatening e-mail was merely a prank.

Two Russia spies apprehended in Ljubljana,"The Slovenian intelligence and security agency SOVA has apprehended and detained, in cooperation with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), two foreign citizens accused of spying for Russia, the newspaper Delo and news portal Siol reported on Monday. The alleged spies were arrested in an office building in Ljubljana.","The Ljubljana district state prosecutor's office confirmed that based on a SOVA announcement they had launched pre-trial proceedings. At the beginning of last December they filed a request for investigation with the Ljubljana District Court against two individuals who had been accused of a criminal offence of espionage.

The accused, who were apprehended on 5 December 2022, were remanded in custody, the prosecutor's office told Siol, but did not disclose anything else due to the nature of the investigation.

If proven guilty, the suspects face in total up to eight years in prison.

The investigation against the two is ongoing on the suspicion of spying for a foreign intelligence agency and certifying false content in official documents.

The suspects hold third country citizenship and had on them third country passports and did not tell the authorities they were Russian citizens. According to Delo, one of them is an Argentinian citizen.

Siol reported that according to unofficial information, the two had been active not only in Slovenia but also abroad and they had collaborated with foreign intelligence agencies.

The alleged spies were based in a rented office in the Lesnina office building on Parmova Street in the Bežigrad borough in Ljubljana, Delo reported. The company they used as a front for their operation in Slovenia was allegedly dealing in real estate and antiques.","crime, law and justice"
GEN energy group stays EUR 23 million in black,"The GEN energy group reported on Tuesday EUR 4.1 billion in revenue for 2022, up from EUR 3.5 billion the year before. The management said that despite the difficult conditions, Slovenia's largest energy group generated an estimated EUR 23 million in net profit, down from EUR 105.6 million in 2021.","Turnover generated by the group, which got a new management at the end of last year, was above plans, although sales volumes were lower due to price increases.

Dejan Paravan, the CEO of core company GEN Energija, told the press the state-owned power utility, which runs the Slovenian half of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant (NEK), had performed well in the given circumstances, if falling short of the EUR 60 million net profit target.

Business was negatively impacted by lower output from hydroelectric power plants due to drought, the purchase of replacement power during the outage of the Krško plant, as well as price regulation for households and small business customers.

While for households, a price lower than the regulated price had already been fixed before the regulation kicked in, the impact on small business customers was offset by the good performance of Gen-I, by far the largest electricity trader in the country.

Positive effects were recorded from international trade, sustained production at NEK despite the drought, higher production at the Thermoelectric Power Plant Brestanica and surpassed plans when it comes to the installing of self-sustaining solar power plants.

Gen Energija had a revenue of EUR 372 million last year, up from EUR 239.5 million in 2021, and a net profit of EUR 1 million, down from EUR 27.1 million in 2021.

""We consider the group to be on a stable footing. The key is that we have our own electricity generation capacity,"" Paravan said, adding GEN was in a position to ""support the government's measures to protect consumers so that they can avoid price hikes"" and that there was reason to stay optimistic.","economy, business and finance"
Slovenian rescue team returning from Turkey,"A Slovenian team of rescue dogs and their handlers that was sent to Turkey to help locate earthquake survivors is returning to Slovenia on Saturday, the Defence Ministry said.","The team of seven rescue dogs, their handlers and four assistants was deployed to Turkey on Tuesday, under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, in the wake of one of the deadliest earthquakes in decades that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday.

The team joined the rescue effort on the ground on Wednesday to comb through the rubble in search of life.

It will return home today in cooperation with the Slovenian army.

Blaž Turk, the head of the team, said that the work had been very demanding. The team was highly motivated throughout their time in Turkey and even the dogs' injuries did not dampen their motivation, he said as quoted by the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.

The administration said that one of the seven dogs had not been able to take part in the rescue effort yesterday, adding that the dog's wound had been treated.

It also posted a video on Twitter in which one of the handlers said there was confusion as to which facilities had already been checked by dogs, so they were in contact with local representatives to make sure they were searching for signs of life in the right places.

The debris makes it very difficult to drive on the roads, which are impassable, so even a short journey in the same street can take half an hour, he said, adding that they would soon hit the 100th hour of the effort, meaning that time was slowly running out for rescuers.

He said there was still hope of finding survivors, ""but there is more and more of the smell of dead bodies buried in the rubble, which is quite stressful for us as well as the dogs.""

Earlier this week, the administration said they were expected to stay in Turkey for four or five days, as exhaustion usually set in after such a period.

Many international search teams are gradually withdrawing from the affected areas due to the deteriorating security situation, injuries and exhaustion, the ministry said in a press release.

A number of Slovenian relief and charity organisations, including Unicef Slovenia, the Slovenian Red Cross and Caritas, have launched donation campaigns to help people in the affected areas in Turkey and Syria. They opened dedicated accounts and donations are also possible via text messages.

Caritas Slovenia has so far raised more than EUR 120,000, the organisation said today as it called for additional support.

More than 24,000 people have been confirmed dead so far in the wake of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks that struck Turkey and Syria, and the death toll keeps rising.",disaster and accident

Finance says large drop in apartment prices still unlikely,"Finance notes in Thursday's commentary that the situation in the real estate market has changed considerably, but a scenario of a large drop in prices is still hard to imagine.","In the commentary headlined End of Real Estate Fairy Tale?, the business newspaper says that compared with the third quarter, the growth of prices stopped in the last quarter of 2022, and that the number of transactions decreased significantly.

""So did prices peak last year?"", Finance wonders, adding that the ""situation in the market has changed considerably. Why? Firstly, higher interest rates have clearly kicked in - housing loans are significantly more expensive today than they were a year ago.""

Secondly, apartments in Ljubljana have become very expensive, especially in the last two years, and thirdly, investment purchases have dropped sharply, which is logical, as treasury bills bring a return that is greater than buying and renting out an apartment in Ljubljana.

And fourthly, not everything is sold any more, and the stock of unsold newly-built apartments is increasing, Finance says, noting that investors used to quickly sold out projects even without websites promoting them.

""What's next? It is still true that a scenario of a considerable general decline in prices is kind of hard to imagine right now.""

The newspaper adds that people are not overly indebted, and that there are not many large builders which are financially weak and which have large stocks of unsold apartments.

""Of course, this does not mean that prices of apartments cannot drop ... as many people may realise for the first time that this is possible,"" concludes the commentary.","economy, business and finance"
Justice minister says govt serious about fixing pay disparities in judiciary,"Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan underlined on Friday the willingness of the government to accommodate the efforts of judges, prosecutors and other judicial official to fix pay disparities. She said the EUR 600 gross monthly bonus that was announced for them this week was a temporary measure in place until a systemic solution is found.","In a response to a question by coalition Freedom Movement MP Urška Klakočar Zupančič about the timeline of the measures, Pipan explained that 1,093 judges and prosecutors would be receiving the bonus and that the annual cost of the measure was estimated at EUR 9.1 million.

The minister said the step was a sign the government was serious about implementing one of the key coalition agreement commitments - to fix, after many years, the wage disparities in the judicial system and secure judges' independence.

She noted the measures came after the government already initialled in September last year with public sector trade unions a deal on measures addressing wages and other labour costs for 2022 and 2023. The deal determined that pay for all wage brackets increase by 4.5% in October 2022.

The latest changes to the act on public sector wages will moreover bring a one-pay bracket promotion for all public servants on 1 April, while an additional, 66th pay bracket is being added to the public sector pay system.

Švarc Pipan added that the existing rankings of individual public servants and their wages needed to be reviewed and that the disparities would be addressed as part of an overhaul of the public sector pay system. A bill to this effect is expected by 30 June at the latest.","crime, law and justice"
Waters receding as rain stops,"Waters in west and north Slovenia swelled by heavy rains that hit large parts of the country on Friday morning are starting to recede as the rain is gradually stopping. While there has been some flooding, in particular in the westernmost regions, it was not nearly as bad as the record floods in early August.","The Environment Agency said that rainfall in the last 18 hours ranged from 60 to 120 millimetres in the west, hitting 220 millimetres on Mount Vogel. Further east there was not so much rain, but the Logar Valley nevertheless got 158 millimetres, said meteorologist Brane Gregorčič.

He said little precipitation is expected by the end of the day, though there may be some isolated showers.

The situation remains serious in Baška Grapa, a narrow valley in the west where several houses and roads were under water, leading to the preventive evacuation of 15 residents from two villages, said Ervin Čurlič of the regional Civil Protection force for North Primorska.

The Bača is still flooding but the waters are gradually receding, according to hydrologist Andrej Golob.

The Soča as well as rivers in and around Idrija and Cerkno and further east towards Ljubljana swelled as well, as did torrential streams.

Most of the flooding was in floodplains, but many roads were at least temporarily inundated too and reports of flooded houses are coming from Idrija, Ajdovščina, Kobarid, Kanal ob Soči, and Nova Gorica.

There was concern further east, in the Upper Savinja Valley, the area hit the worst in early August. Reports from the ground suggest there was some flooding but the situation is not bad.

Ljubno Mayor Franjo Naraločnik told the STA the Ljubnica, a tributary of the Savinja, flooded a few houses and swept away a segment of a local road.

In Nazarje, further downstream, the Savinja and Dreta flooded a few fields and two houses, said Mayor Matej Pečovnik.",weather
SID Bank reports substantially lower profit for 2022,"SID Bank, the state-owned export and development bank, saw its net profit reduced by two-thirds last year to EUR 8.25 million, which the management says is still above targets. The total of loans to companies and other non-bank customers rose by 15% to EUR 1.38 billion.","""SID Bank's indicators reflect the challenges faced by the Slovenian and wider European economy,"" Damijan Dolinar, until recently chairman of the SID Bank management board, is quoted as saying in the annual report. Dolinar, who was replaced by Borut Jamnik earlier this month, finds 2022 to have been successful for the bank.

The bank continued to provide strong direct support to businesses. Apart from direct financing, which was up by around 30% from 2020, the bank's management also pointed to the financing of investments with the possibility of a guarantee from the Pan-European Guarantee Fund as an important tool in support of the economy where the financing amounted to EUR 102 million.

Due to the strong liquidity of the Slovenian banking sector, there was less demand for indirect forms of financing through banks and, as a result, there was no need for countercyclical intervention, as in 2020 and 2021.

The total volume of SID Bank's activities, which is expressed in terms of the stock of financing operations and includes both direct and indirect effects, amounted to EUR 2.2 billion last year. Dolinar said the figure was above the strategic target indicator set in the annual management plan.

The fourth and final tranche of cohesion funds under the 2014-2020 Fund of Funds had been drawn in December 2022. By the end of the year, a total of 8,201 loans worth EUR 367.8 million had been signed from the Fund of Funds and the special Fund of Funds to tackle the impact of the Covid pandemic.

The bank also offered indirect financing for investments and/or ongoing business operations through banks and savings banks. The development of risk-sharing lending is also being prepared, which will allow banks to boost development financing and capital management at the same time.

After Russia's attack on Ukraine, SID Bank expanded its financing programme based on a special state aid scheme to support the economy to mitigate the negative impact of the war in Ukraine on business operations as well as based on a law to mitigate the impact of the energy crisis.

According to Dolinar, the post-Covid period, which coincided with the war in Ukraine, had a marked impact on the insurance operations carried out by SID Bank on behalf of and for the account of the state.

The volume of insurance business last year exceeded EUR 2 billion, which was above plans, but still more than a quarter less than the previous year. The bank attributes this mainly to the expiry of the European measure to insure export claims against temporarily non-marketable risks and sanctions on Russian and Belarusian entities.

In March, SID Bank in cooperation with the European Investment Fund expanded the Slovenian Growth Capital Investment Programme, established in 2017, by EUR 120 million, with the aim of reducing the equity financing gap for companies in the seed, start-up and high-growth phases in Slovenia and supporting the financing of equity succession in Slovenian family-owned companies.

The bank's total assets amounted to EUR 2.80 billion at the end of 2022 and were just slightly lower than the year before. Deposits by the non-banking sector increased by 5% to EUR 1.03 billion. At EUR 8.25 million, net profit compares to EUR 24 million in 2021, but is on a par with the figure in 2020.","economy, business and finance"
ZPIZ proposes 3.5% extraordinary pension increase,The council of the public pension fund ZPIZ has proposed to the government a 3.5% extraordinary adjustment of pensions for all pensioners and a 1% additional adjustment for pensioners who had retired up to and including 2011.

They say the court is not in a crisis, but Rok Svetlič says the law on the Constitutional Court has been bypassed and Špelca Mežnar criticises obstruction, urging higher standards for judges.","Four of the five judges present at the session last Friday voted to lift the stay of the new RTV legislation, specifically Matej Accetto, Rajko Knez, Katja Šugman Stubbs and Mežnar, while Svetlič voted against. Two judges were not present at the session, while the remaining two had been recused.

By lifting the stay last Friday, the judges gave the green light to new RTV governing bodies to be constituted, with the first session of the new council due on Monday.

Touching on whether the court can or cannot lift the stay, Šugman Stubbs says in her concurring opinion that there is no doubt the court can lift the stay.

The only question is under what conditions it can do it, she says, adding the court must keep an eye on the situation that has an impact on their assessment of the damage that a certain piece of legislation can cause and act accordingly.

As for the pace of making decisions, Knez says in his concurring opinion that deciding fast on the changes to the RTV Slovenia Act was part of their deliberations.

He argues that the judges could see ""severe damage in both cases"" - if they stay the law and if they lift the stay, which led to their intensive work in the case.

The judges also provide a comment on the terms in office of senior RTV staff and managers, who were relegated to acting capacity when the law took effect in December.

Both Knez and Mežnar, in her concurring opinion, say that by staying the law, the court in fact extended indefinitely their terms, but did not regulate their legal status.

Knez admits that the termination of the terms create severe damaging consequences for the senior staff.

However, even more severe consequences can arise if they remain in office in acting capacity without adequate safeguards to protect RTV Slovenija in case they act against the interest of the public broadcaster.

The only dissenting opinion was penned by Svetlič, who says that by unfreezing the law and allowing new bodies to be set up, the applicants have lost their jobs irreversibly.

As a result, the court will have to declare that the applicants have lost their legal interest in challenging the law and throw out the petition to assess the provisions about early termination of the terms of senior staff. This means that ""a substantive decision in the most important part of the petition"" will never be made.

He also says the unfreezing of the law has the same effect as would the final decision that would find that the provisions governing the termination of the terms ""are not in contradiction with the constitution"". The lifting of the stay thus circumvented the Constitutional Court Act, and the court denied legal remedy to the applicants.

Nevertheless, some judges believe the final, substantive decision on the law could be reached, yet not quickly. They expect to take it within a reasonable time, but this could be several years.

""It is unnecessary to talk about a crisis of the Constitutional Court because we are currently unable to reach a majority. The Constitutional Court will decide on the petition sooner or later,"" Mežnar says.

However, she finds worrying the prospect of obstruction at the court, saying it was only by a miraculous series of coincidences that the court was able to reach the quorum for lifting the suspension.

""Unfortunately, it must be admitted that for the first time in the history of this institution, the risk of obstruction was very real,"" says Mežnar. She thus highlights the role of integrity of judges.

She says the only two legal requirements for a constitutional judge are the age and being ""a legal expert"", which she believes are too low standards.

Mežnar thus urges insisting on the unwritten rule of high moral integrity for constitutional judges. ""Unlike constitutional law, decency cannot be taught.""","crime, law and justice"
Slovenia receiving Statehood Day congratulations from abroad,"Slovenia is receiving many congratulations from abroad on Statehood Day on Sunday. Apart from the EU and NATO, congratulations are also coming from the US, Turkey, Romania, Albania, Poland, Greece, Montenegro and Ukraine.","Congratulating Slovenians on Statehood Day, the European Council noted on Twitter that Slovenia has the largest share of Natura 2000 sites in the EU and that more than a tenth of all species in this nature conservation network live in it.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that ""on behalf of the USA, I offer our best wishes to the people of Slovenia as you honor your Statehood Day.""

Blinken once again congratulated Slovenia for being elected to the UN Security Council for 2024-2025.

""I'm confident Slovenia will meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. This milestone builds on your emergence as a vibrant democracy, a champion of good governance and rule of law, and a regional leader in promoting security and Euro-Atlantic integration in the Western Balkans,"" he said.

Slovenia was also congratulated on Twitter by the foreign ministries of Latvia, Armenia, Turkey, Romania, Albania, Poland, Maldives, Greece, Montenegro, Iran, Qatar, Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

Ukraine expressed gratitude to Slovenia for the strong and unwavering support, adding that it was looking forward to expand the cooperation between the two countries for the good of Europe and the whole world.",politics

"MEP Tomc alleges govt wages ""war on media""","Slovenian MEP Romana Tomc (SDS/EPP) has written to the chair of the European Parliament's task force for democracy to allege that the Slovenian government is ""waging war on the media and independent journalism,"" a charge the ruling party says is made up.","In a letter to Sophie in 't Veld, chair of the democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights monitoring group, Tomc claims public broadcaster RTV Slovenija is being subjected to attempts at political control as evident from pressure on a member of the programme council.

Tomc cited reports saying a councillor, Andrej Prebil, had been pressured by Freedom Movement MP Mojca Šetinc Pašek, a former journalist at RTV Slovenija, to sign a motion for an emergency session or risk losing his post as the CEO of tourism company Sava.

Tomc said that should these claims be true, this would be ""yet another episode of escalating political pressure that the government is exerting on the leadership of RTV Slovenija.""

The Freedom Movement dismissed Tomc's claim as a fabrication, saying that the statement, made by programme council chair Peter Gregorčič at a recent session, had been denied by councillor Prebil.

The ruling party said Tomc was ""actively involved in denigrating MP Mojca Šetinc Pašek, the Freedom Movement and Robert Golob"" and expected Tomc to revoke her statement and publicly apologise.

Tomc's letter is yet another mosaic in the ongoing struggle at RTV Slovenija, where journalists complain that senior staff installed under the previous, SDS-led government is conducting purges and turning the broadcaster into an SDS mouthpiece. Resistance to this is in turn being labelled by the SDS as an attack on free media and plurality.

Interestingly, Tomc was a vocal opponent of Sophie in 't Veld when the Dutch MEP led a high-profile inquiry into the situation at the STA, which had been financially drained to the edge of bankruptcy under the SDS-led government in what earned the then government sharp criticism across the EU.",politics
