Govt and teachers' union reach agreement on pay,"The teachers' trade union SVIZ and the government reached a strike a agreement on Wednesday, a year after the union staged a strike demanding better pay. The agreement was initialled today and still needs to be approved by the strike committee. The body is scheduled to discuss it tomorrow, likely the government as well.","Both sides expressed satisfaction today with Igor Papič, the minister of higher education, science and innovation saying he was happy that unresolved issues are being included in the planned pay system reform. No other details were given about the contents of the agreement.

SVIZ head Branimir Štrukelj pointed out that the document must yet be approved by the strike committee, but said the negotiating team did its best and achieved the maximum. He did not want to discuss the content of the agreement before the committee decides on it.

When announcing a general strike over a year ago and staging a strike on 9 March 2022, SVIZ had nine demands. So far, the government has raised the salaries of assistant kindergarten teachers and university researchers.",education
Mandatory military service abolished 20 years ago (feature),"Twenty years to the day a regulation on voluntary military service entered into force, in what was one of the milestones towards the abolishment of conscription that took the Slovenian Armed Forces closer to a professional military force.","Parliament decided to abolish conscription already in 2002, but the changes to the Military Service Act still set down training of conscripts until the end of 2004.

The 2 September 2003 regulation then enabled citizens aged 18 to 27 to engage in voluntary military training for at least three months for which they would get paid.

Seven days after the regulation entered into force, PM Anton Rop and Defence Minister Anton Grizold announced full abolishment of the conscription system.

This meant that the last three generations of conscripts did not join any mandatory military training.

<b>Sudden abolishment result of declining interest in military service</b>

The then defence minister, Grizold, a defence expert, justified the abolishment of conscription by saying young men were increasingly not interested in serving.

Major General Ladislav Lipič, chief of the general staff in 2001-2006, has now told the STA this happened after SDS leader Janez Janša and LibDem leader and PM Janez Drnovšek said in 2002 that Slovenia no longer needed conscription.

""Politicians were a bit to quick to communicate this to the public and did not think about what such statements could do.""

Lipič explains that to ""get 650 recruits respond to conscription, the administration had to send out over 3,500 conscripts, and then a significant number of individuals would further drop out after medical examinations"".

Defence studies expert Maja Garb says the decision to abolish conscription ""was political, while long-term experiences also showed the generations of conscripts were getting smaller"".

Soon after Slovenia gained independence in 1991, there were many conscripts, because those who did not serve during independence processes did so after independence.

The numbers later decreased due to demographics, the option of conscientious objection or civilian service, and poorer health of young men.

Also, Slovenia began NATO integration, having more and more tasks for which a professional army is better suited, says Garb from the Ljubljana Faculty of Social Sciences.

<b>Closer to NATO with professional army</b>

Transition to a professional army facilitated faster development, making the army more interoperable with other members of NATO, which Slovenia joined in 2004.

Among the first NATO integration tasks was adjusting military education and training to the alliance' models, which did not go entirely without challenges.

Lipič says it was impossible to expect that officers and NCOs who had trained only conscripts would start training professional soldiers overnight.

The NCO-private relationship also became more impersonal, based on the Western model, which Lipič says was not suited to the mentality of Slovenian soldiers.

However, Garb says a professional army means a well trained, responsible and ethical army, and professional standards do not apply only to officers but also NCOs and privates.

<b>Professional army probably not much cheaper than conscription-based</b>

Garb says it is difficult to say which type of recruitment is cheaper for the country, but she assumes a professional army is more expensive.

However, since a conscription army also has its professional composition, its cost would not be significantly lower, but such an army would not be able to fulfil all its tasks with the same quality.

""The Slovenian Armed Forces can certainly be said to be doing its job well, despite its many problems,"" she says.

A shortage of soldiers is its biggest problem, and Garb says it is not improving despite the many measures taken.

Another issue is, according to her, an identity crisis. ""Is it a combat, humanitarian, expeditionary, defence, national army or subject to foreign interests?""

Legislation clearly shows that we must have an army with multiple identities, but one should not forget that the army's No.1 task is to defend the country, she says.

<b>With professional army, politicians know less about military</b>

Going from a conscription to professional army also leads to disintegration of social control over it, says Lipič, adding that families used to have sons in the army and thus direct contact with it.

""There is considerably less of this social oversight now, we've been left with institutional civilian oversight via the parliamentary Defence Committee,"" he says.

Garb agrees, adding that with a professional army people are less interested in military affairs and much less aware of its role of providing defence and security.

She finds it even more problematic that when a country has a professional army politicians no longer have military experience and consequently take poor decisions [regarding the army].",education
Slovenia records low share of youth neither employed nor in education,"Slovenia ranks among EU countries with the lowest share of young people aged 15-29 who were neither employed nor in education or training in 2022, Eurostat data shows. Standing below the EU average, the country's share was 8.5%, while the EU figures ranged from 4.2% in the Netherlands to 19.8% in Romania.","Slovenia's share was seventh lowest in the EU, reads a report Eurostat released last week. The country ranks among those which last year or earlier met the long-term target of reducing the share of young adults who are neither employed nor in education to below 9% by 2030.

The EU average in 2022 was 11.7%. The EU's overall share of young adults who were neither in employment nor in education or training declined by 4.3 percentage points between 2012 and 2022.",education
Labour Court rules in favour of students in scholarship dispute,"Covid-19 legislation provisions that led to results from 2019/20 competitions being disregarded as a criterion in applications for Zois sate merit scholarships have been declared as unlawful by the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court, the newspaper Delo reported on Thursday. Twelve lawsuits have so far been filed over the issue.","While extraordinary achievements, including at competitions, are among the criteria in the awarding of the Zois state scholarship for talented secondary school and college students, legislation adopted during the pandemic in late 2020 omitted this criterion for the 2019/20 year.

The argument was that only 48 of the planned 68 competitions at state level were held during that school year and that only 37% of secondary school students - the share that was able to participate in the competitions completed - would have been able to try to capitalise on their achievement.

Thus the government at the time decided to disregard all the results, so as to not put the remaining students at a disadvantage.

Constitutional jurist and law philosopher Andraž Teršek was among those who brought attention to the issue. He later also represented the winner of the only state competition for musicians that counts towards this scholarship - the next competition for her instrument was only scheduled again in three years, Delo reported.

The paper said that the Labour and Social Court has now ruled that disregarding all the achievements had been wrong, stressing that 25 competitions had still been completed.

The Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Ministry has announced it will examine the ruling and fully comply with it.",education
Govt lowers education requirements for the army,"The government adopted changes to the act on service in the Slovenian Armed Forces on Thursday lowering the education requirement for joining the army. In line with the changes, which will be fast-tracked through parliament, primary education will be enough to join the army.","The Government Communication Office said after today's session the changes were to increase the interest in the army as a career opportunity and transpose an EU directive on working time during stand-by duty.

The changes introduce the possibility of hiring soldiers who have finished just primary school if the person agrees to undergo training to obtain a secondary level of education.

The changes also deal with soldiers' working time during stand-by duty, saying that it can be equally or unequally distributed in a day, week or a month. This specifically excludes the protection of certain categories of workers who enjoy special protection under the general rules. Protection is still granted to certain categories of workers in emergencies or a state of high alert, the press release said.

The financial implications of the law are estimated at around EUR 65,000 per year to finance the cost of secondary education, assuming that 50 candidates with a primary education degree are recruited in a year.

The government also suspended today the legislative procedure regarding a bill introducing a bonus for judicial officials. The bill will first be presented to the coalition deputy groups and then the procedure will resume, explained Prime Minister Robert Golob.

He said this was in line with the coalition agreement and that the move was nothing out of the ordinary. ""We want to do that precisely because things are again being misinterpreted in the public or in parliament and we actually want to forward it to parliament as soon as possible,"" he said.

Golob's promise that judges and prosecutors will receive a monthly bonus of EUR 600 gross from 1 January until the public sector pay system is reformed has prompted a number of groups in the public sector to demand pay rises.",education
Slovenia welcomes in new academic year,"The 2023-2024 academic year started in Slovenia on Monday with some 7,000 first-year students being greeted at the University of Ljubljana, the country's largest and oldest university.","All three public universities in Slovenia - the University of Ljubljana, the University of Maribor and the University of Primorska - prepared special activities today or in recent days to ease the transition to university life for their first-year students.

University rectors delivered their welcome speeches, and Higher Education Minister Igor Papič wished the students a good academic year.

Initial estimates by the Higher Education Ministry show that some 65,180 students will study at universities this academic year and an additional 11,000 at higher vocational education institutions.

A total of 14,270 students started uni today, of which roughly half are studying at the University of Ljubljana and some 3,500 are enrolled at the University of Maribor.

""Passing on knowledge to younger generations is one of our core missions, and today we are delighted to welcome you into our great academic community,"" University of Ljubljana Rector Gregor Majdič said, warning that universities should not be ivory towers.

The ministry's data shows that young people are most interested in programmes dedicated to areas such as sport, psychology, health and social care, veterinary science, early childhood education, information and communications technology, and art and design.

In line with general trends, universities have been focusing on green and digital content in recent years with the University of Primorska soon to become a full-fledged member of the Transform4Europe alliance.",education
Slovenian MEPs call for parliament tours in Slovenian,Slovenian MEPs called for tours of the European Parliament to be held in Slovenian again in a letter to EU officials. They noted that Slovenian is one of the languages that is often discriminated against in the European Parliament.,"Since late September 2022 interactive tours of the Hemicycle have not been available in Slovenian due to staff shortages. Slovenian visitors are thus left with two options - to listen to the presentation in English or to not have a presentation at all, the MEPs wrote.

This puts Slovenian tourists in an unequal position and defeats the main purpose of ensuring multilingualism, the Slovenian MEPs added.

""Although we understand the reason for the current situation, we want to warn that a lack of Slovenian or Slovenian speaking staff is not a new problem. A single employee that is responsible for organisation and tours for all groups cannot be enough,"" they noted.

The MEPs urge that the discrimination be tackled as soon as possible and tours be held in Slovenian for Slovenian visitors. They recommend a renovation of the system of the presentations.

The letter was addressed to the European Parliament Secretary General Alessandro Chiocchetti, head of Directorate for Communication Jaume Duch Guillot, head of Directorate for Visitors Ciril Štokelj and head of Visits and Seminars Unit Markus Bonecamp.",education
Reading literacy of Slovenian ten-year-olds deteriorates,"Slovenian fourth-graders have exhibited a drop in their reading literacy result after years of an upward trend, showed the latest PIRLS 2021 international study. With 520 points, Slovenia still placed above the mean value. Education Minister Darjo Felda says the ministry is drawing up an action plan to remedy the situation.","The drop in results can in part be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic but not entirely, Felda said of the study carried out in spring of 2021 after schools were closed for a longer period of time. He added that a lot can be done as early as in kindergarten.

The PIRLS study is conducted every five years and Slovenia has taken part since its inception in 2001. This is the first downturn in reading literacy for Slovenian pupils, who had previously been improving on their score.

The 6,400 ten-year-olds in the study scored 23 points less than in the 2016 cycle, reporters were told as the results were presented at the ministry on Tuesday. Girls still fared slightly better than boys, but the drop was the same in both genders.

Pupils who have more books, often speak Slovenian at home, and those with parents who love to read did better on the test, said the national research coordinator of PIRLS Eva Klemenčič Mirazchiyski of the Educational Research Institute, adding that results did not differ whether the participants were reading off paper or off the screen.

In Slovenia, the findings did not show major differences between individual schools, but did record huge result variations among the students attending those schools.

On an international level, out of the 57 countries, the majority saw a deterioration while only three improved their previous results. Slovenia's results were comparable with those of Germany, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, Malta, France, Serbia and Albania.

Decision-makers, including the National Council for Reading Literacy will be able to use the results in finalising the action plan to develop reading literacy, as well as include them in the upcoming curricula, Felda said, hoping for better results in the next PIRLS cycle.",education
Cabinet reshuffle to be set in motion,The National Assembly is expected to take note of the resignation of two ministers in the Robert Golob government on Monday as part of a reorganisation of the cabinet in line with the government act that was endorsed in the November 2022 triple referendum. Golob is expected to put forward a reshuffled ministerial line-up to parliament today.,"Bojan Kumer has resigned as minister of infrastructure and Igor Papič as minister of education, science and sport. This is because Kumer is to take up a new brief on the environment, climate and energy and Papič as minister of higher education, science and innovation.

The new government act, which came into effect late last year, introduces three new portfolios. Apart from the two assigned to Kumer and Papič, a third new ministry will be in charge of solidarity-based future. Simon Maljevac, now a state secretary at the Labour Ministry, is tipped to take over there.

As the new law came into force, the terms of four ministers ended. The names of their portfolios have changed so these officials, currently serving as acting ministers, will have to undergo parliamentary hearings for a second time this term.

Matjaž Han will be heard again as candidate for minister of the economy, tourism and sports, Aleksander Jevšek as candidate for minister of cohesion and regional development, Emilija Stojmenova Duh as minister of digital transformation and Uroš Brežan as minister of natural resources and spatial planning.

Jevšek and Stojmenova Duh have so far served as ministers without portfolios, heading the respective government offices, while Han's and Beržan's briefs are being partly changed.

The hearings are expected to involve a total of nine ministerial nominees. They are expected to be held on Thursday and Friday.

Alenka Bratušek is to take over the infrastructure brief and Darjo Felda as minister of pre-school, primary and secondary education.

It is not clear whether the hearings will also involve a candidate for a new interior minister after Tatjana Bobnar resigned in early December. Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik has been standing in for the interior minister in the meantime.",education
Best student theses on Slovenians abroad receive awards,"Minister for Slovenians Abroad Matej Arčon conferred on Tuesday awards for the best theses and dissertations dealing with Slovenians abroad. The 21st edition of the competition saw 17 submitted works, for a total of 373 works in the 21 years.","The competition is organised in two categories, one focused on theses discussing Slovenian minorities in neighbouring countries and the other on works on Slovenian emigrants.

Jasmina Klanjšček placed second with a master's thesis on the importance of sound awareness in a bilingual kindergarten. Helena Lupinc took third place for a bachelor's thesis on the National Hall in Trieste, a Slovenian community centre.

In the second category the winner was Nadia Molek for her PhD dissertation on the processes of establishing the identity of Slovenians in Argentina. Neli Skočaj took second place with a master's thesis that posed the question whether knowledge of the Slovenian language was a prerequisite to experiencing the Slovenian ethnic identity. Third place went to Alenka Tratnik for a master's thesis on the experience of migration as a source of learning.

The winners in both categories will receive EUR 800, while the authors in second place will receive EUR 600 and those that placed third EUR 400.

Arčon noted that the works are extremely precious to the Government Office for Slovenians Abroad and very enriching for the Slovenian community at large.",education
Event marks 30 years of Military Schools Centre,"The Military Schools Centre celebrated its 30th birthday in 2021, but due to Covid restrictions the event marking the anniversary was held with a two-year delay in Maribor on Friday. Addressing the ceremony, President Nataša Pirc Musar described the centre as the pillar of military education and training in Slovenia.","The centre is an important promoter of Slovenian military thought and the development and strengthening of military expertise and professions, the president told the event, held at the military facility Kadetnica.

""The centre carries out one of the fundamental tasks of the Defence Act, meaning education and training for armed combat and other forms of military defence, and is one of the cornerstones of Slovenia's military professionalisation,"" said Brigadier Peter Zakrajšek, commander of the centre, which is part of the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF).

So far, the centre has provided education to more than 1,000 individuals, of whom some 10% women, and more than 250 people have been sent to participate in educational or training programmes abroad.

An optional military module, which has been accredited by various Slovenian faculties at the first Bologna level, will be introduced in the training of officer candidates next year. A combination of military and public education, the module's programme will take place at Kadetnica in Slovenia's second largest city.

The anniversary ceremony also marked the coming Military Schools Centre Day, which has been observed on 15 April since 2020 to honour the beginnings of formal military training in Slovenia in the early 1990s.

The president said in her keynote address that ""unfortunately, the past and the present teach us that access to education is not always guaranteed and taken for granted"", adding that this fundamental human right must also be fought for. Slovenia realised this in 1991 when started to develop its own concept of training military conscripts amid the escalating situation the country.

""What was especially important is that for the first time since the Second World War the Slovenian language was again used to issue commands,"" Pirc Musar noted as she thanked retired Colonel Andrej Kocbek, the first commander of the centre, for his contribution to the development of military training in the country.

Before the ceremony, the president toured the Military Museum in Kadetnica and visited the 72nd brigade in the General Maister Barracks in Maribor.

She is happy and proud to be among Slovenian soldiers, not only as SAF commander-in-chief but also because she firmly believes that soldiers are bastions of peace, she said.

The Slovenian army keeps improving every year, the president said as she welcomed an increase in defence spending. Noting shortages of soldiers, she committed to making an extra effort to promote this profession.",education
Slovenia spends less on education than OECD average,"Slovenia spends 4.6% of its GDP on education, which puts it below the OECD average of 5.1%, shows the newest OECD publication Education at a Glance.","Teachers are paid lower than an average employee with tertiary education in Slovenia and in the OECD in general. In Slovenia average wages of teachers in primary school reach 91-92% of an average wage of employees with tertiary education, depending on the age group taught. Wages of high school teachers are at 94% of the average wage of a person with tertiary education, while those of kindergarten teachers and assistants are at 73%.

Starting wages of Slovenian teachers are under the OECD average if purchasing power is taken into account, however Slovenian teachers at the top of the pay scale are paid more than is the OECD average.

In Slovenia 46% of adults aged between 25 and 34 attained the highest level of education in a vocational programme. For 38% that was secondary vocational education and for 8% tertiary vocational education.

Vocational education is most prevalent in Austria where it is the highest level of education for more than 50% of the population aged 25 to 34, while in countries like the US and Mexico it is the highest level of education for less than 5%.

Those with a vocational education have a lower rate of unemployment. In Slovenia 5.1% of people between the ages of 25 and 34 with a vocational education are homeless, compared to 9.4% of those that completed a general secondary education.

Slovenia is below the OECD average when it comes to adults without secondary education. In Slovenia the share is at 5%, while in the OECD it is at 14%.

Among Slovenians between the ages of 15 and 19, 27% are enrolled in general secondary education, 52% in vocational secondary education, 3% in primary education and 12% in tertiary education.

Ljubljana Reading Manifesto celebrated at Frankfurt Book Fair,The opening event of Slovenia's stint as the guest of honour at the Frankfurt Book Fair in front of a capacity crowd hailed on Wednesday the message of the Ljubljana Reading Manifesto on the permanent significance of higher-level reading.,"The presentation of one of Slovenia's main contributions in Frankfurt, drawn up by reading researchers, involved addresses by several high-level figures, who spoke of the crucial importance of higher-level reading for democracy, critical thought, reflection, understanding and empathy.

Participants were also addressed via video link by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, who argued higher-level reading was key to the survival of democracies. It provides individuals with the knowledge and skills to make the best decisions, with democracies needing a well-informed citizenry willing to contribute to collective projects.

The head of the Frankfurt Book Fair Juergen Boos described the launch of the Ljubljana Manifesto as his favourite moment of the fair, adding that the document's implications were relevant for everyone. It is the ability to read, he said, that is connected to the ability to reflect and to define oneself in society.

Also stressing the importance of higher-level reading capacities were Slovenian Culture Minister Asta Vrečko, and her German counterpart Claudia Roth.

Roth announced she would sign the manifesto on behalf of the German government and called for its reach to extend to the EU level. She believes governments in democracies around the world should read the document to better understand the present.

Vrečko noted the implications of higher-level reading capacities for both the development of individuals and society, allowing for a tolerant and dialogue-oriented society.

Meanwhile, head of the German Academy for Language and Literature Ernst Osterkamp warned that higher-level reading was under threat in today's digitalised era and that new educational policies would be necessary to preserve it.

Karine Pansa from the International Publishers Association (IPA) expressed full support for the Ljubljana Manifesto. She called for collaboration among those involved in the creation, printing, and sale of books, stressing the importance of digital and print working together as opposed to the digital-versus-print debate.

Burhan Sönmez, president of PEN International, said both sides should be listened to in today's conflicted times. He noted that wars and conflicts create enemies, while literature is always on the side of peace, fostering understanding and love for fellow humans.

The manifesto, authored by the curator of the Slovenian programme in Frankfurt Miha Kovač, Anne Mangen from the University of Stavanger in Norway, Andre Schüller-Zwierlein from the University of Regensburg in Germany and Adriaan van der Weel from Leiden University in the Netherlands, can be signed at http:readingmanifesto.org.

Its main message is that higher-level reading is ""our most powerful tool for analytical and critical thinking"", crucial in a time when ""societies are facing fundamental transformations as digital technologies are changing the ways we live, interact, work, study and read"".

""It exercises metacognition and cognitive patience, expands our conceptual capacities, trains cognitive empathy and perspective-taking - social skills which are indispensable for informed citizens in a democratic society,"" states the introduction to the manifesto.

It adds that ""signatories of this manifesto call to acknowledge the permanent significance of higher-level reading in the digital era"".",education
President Pirc Musar visits Defence Ministry as supreme commander,"President Nataša Pirc Musar will support investments in and development of the Slovenian army in line with the country's NATO commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, she said after visiting the Defence Ministry as the supreme commander of the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) on Wednesday.","The president will also make efforts to persuade more young people to recognise the army as a future-oriented profession, not least because of new technologies.

Received with military honours, Pirc Musar was briefed by Defence Minister Marjan Šarec and Chief of the General Staff Robert Glavaš on the defence and rescue and disaster relief systems.

She will receive a combat readiness report in March, but asked the ministry to also include data about the army's readiness in energy, food, transport or infrastructure security. She is yet to decide whether to make the report public, but she is convinced that the public has the right to know certain information about the SAF.

The need to modernise defence legislation was also discussed, with the president saying the defence act was outdated and needed to be upgraded to include hybrid threats and new technologies, primarily AI.

Major General Glavaš also briefed her on projects for dual use, for defence and for rescue and disaster relief.

""When spending on the SAF's military equipment grows, we must be aware that spending on scientific research and projects also grows,"" Pirc Musar said, adding that EUR 30 million will be spent on this, ""which is quite a lot"".

She believes that ""this might be one of the steps to attract those interested in science and technology"", she said about the shortage of soldiers the SAF is faced with.

Minister Šarec mentioned in this respect great interest among secondary school and university students in training camps as a way of attracting youth to the SAF.

Since some candidates had to be turned down in the past, the ministry decided to double the capacities to 210 last year, Šarec said.

Pay was another topic on the agenda. Pirc Musar assessed that the base pay for soldiers is low but soldiers get a number of bonuses so it is eventually not that low.

Both Pirc Musar and Šarec said that pay issues should be addressed as part of the entire public sector pay system rather than for individual groups of professions.

""I'm not in favour of a partial solution for doctors, and then for judges, followed by soldiers and police officers,"" said Pirc Musar, adding that the public sector pay system was outdated and needed to be overhauled as a whole.

She also had a video call with commanders of seven SAF missions abroad, and was happy to note that Slovenian soldiers are appreciated abroad and that 17% of Slovenian soldiers are women, which puts the SAF among the EU armies with the largest share of women.",education
Maribor University criticised for rejecting top-level athlete,"The University of Maribor has found itself at the centre of criticism after rejecting a top-level athlete for failing to attend a physical abilities test because she was competing at the European Games and the ITF Taekwondo World Championships on the two days the tests had been held in June and September, climbing the podium at both events.","Tyra Barada wanted to enrol in a sports training programme of the Maribor Faculty of Education but was rejected because she had not completed a physical abilities test. The university has faced a lot of criticism over what some feel is bureaucratic rigidity, but insists that rules must apply to everybody.

The first test was held on 30 June, when Barada was competing at the European Games, where she won a silver and a gold medal. The second test was held on 8 September, when Barada was in Tampere for the ITF World Championships, where she claimed the world champion title in her category.

Rector Zdravko Kačič said on Tuesday that the dates for the two tests had been known since February, also implying that she could have requested for another date, one that suited her. But the school had not received such a request.

Kačič said the university would not give in to pressures ""to act in a discriminatory and unlawful way"". The matura school-leaving exam and the university enrolment are two of the most sensitive points of an individual's education and must therefore be transparent and conducted in line with clear rules, he said.

The rector labelled the criticism as inappropriate and inadmissible. ""Branding the dedication to consistent respect for the rules of the enrolment procedure ... as bureaucratic rigidity ... is inappropriate and dangerous. In this paradigm, any legal proceeding can be branded as bureaucratic rigidity when its result is not in line with one's wishes.""

Meanwhile, Barada's father Tomaž Barada told the local Radio Maribor that she had informed the school that she could not attend before the first test and received a response that she needed to attend the test and that another date would be announced for the test.

She could not attend the second test either, but a third date had not been announced, he said, expressing regret that not all places in the programme had been filled, while his daughter was rejected.",education
PM and Ljubljana rector discuss challenges in higher education,"Challenges and needs of Slovenian society in higher education, including cooperation between businesses, higher education, science and politics, were discussed as Prime Minister Robert Golob received University of Ljubljana Rector Gregor Majdič, who also heads the Slovenian Rectors' Conference, a body uniting university rectors.","According to the University of Ljubljana, Golob expressed support for a document with an action plan for Slovenia's common future development which is being prepared by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS), the Rectors' Conference, and the Coordination of Independent Research Institutes (KOSRIS).

The document, which promotes a more effective and consistent implementation of measures of research and innovation policy, is expected to be signed in early March.

Golob and Majdič agreed that Slovenian society needs a broad and long-term reflection and an analysis of challenges and needs in education and higher education.

The pair discussed organising a public discussion on this topic with representatives of state agencies, businesses, scientists and members of the broader public.

Majdič also told Golob that, once the promise of more funds for higher education is delivered, universities will be able to more easily respond to the needs of Slovenian society, including in terms of new studies and planning enrolment, which must remain in the purview of universities.

The rector moreover highlighted the systemic shortcomings of the public sector pay system for higher education, which he said leads to less interest in university jobs, also among young researchers, and urged a prompt overhaul of the pay system.",education
Education to get most of ex-education ministry's EUR 2.7bn funds,"The former Ministry of Education, Science and Sport's budget of EUR 2.7 billion for 2023 will be distributed among three ministries in the wake of a different make-up of government departments, the parliamentary Education, Science and Youth Committee heard as it discussed the revised national budget for this year on Thursday.","The defunct ministry's funds will be distributed among the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation and the Ministry of the Economy, Tourism and Sport, State Secretary at the Ministry of Education Boris Černilec told the MPs.

The Ministry of Education, which is in charge of policies on kindergarten, primary and secondary school, is entitled to EUR 1.8 billion, or 11% of the national budget.

As much as 95% of this sum is intended for current transfers, such as funding of schools and kindergartens as well as subsidies for individuals and households.

As much as EUR 1.2 billion goes for primary schools, which is almost two-thirds of the ministry's entire budget, said Černilec.

EUR 426 million is intended for secondary schools, or 24% of the ministry's budget, while an additional EUR 19 million was secured for investment in secondary schools.

Pre-school education will get EUR 50 million, the most of which for subsidising kindergarten payments by parents for their second or any other further kid included in pre-school education.

A total of EUR 54 million is allocated for school meal subsidies for primary and secondary school children and for secondary school dorm fees.

The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation will get EUR 846 million, said Matjaž Krajnc, a state secretary at this ministry.

The figure is largely within the parameters for these three fields in the original 2023 national budget, he said, while an additional EUR 1.8 million has been secured to mitigate the consequences of the cost-of-living crisis.

Funds for science and information society have remained the same, at EUR 370 million, and technology and innovation will get EUR 425 million.

EUR 65 million is planned as part of the national recovery and resilience plan, largely to construct a new building for the Veterinary Faculty, according to Krajnc.

Alenka Jeraj, an MP for the opposition Democrats (SDS), noted that the funds for the new premises of the Faculty of Medicine from the recovery plan had been cut.

Krajnc said this is because this is one of the projects where delays could be expected due to potential complaints and reviews, but the ministry is looking for alternative sources of funding and the timeline of the project should not be affected.

Jeraj also inquired why the funds for the teaching profession had been cut, with Černilec saying a call for scholarships for professions in short supply yielded fewer applications than expected.",education

The coalition ""will be a forum of high-level political dialogue to foster international cooperation on climate, trade and sustainable development"".

Slovenia is represented in the coalition by Economy Minister Matjaž Han. Remaining open to all interested countries, the initiative so far consists of over 50 ministers from 27 jurisdictions, the Commission has said.

The next meeting will take place at the sidelines of the next WTO ministerial meeting, expectedly at the beginning of 2024.

The initiative will ""focus on finding trade-related solutions to the climate crisis in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals, whilst supporting ongoing efforts in this area in the World Trade Organization"".",environmental issue
Proposal to suspend sewerage channel C0 construction voted down,"The parliamentary Commission for Petitions, Human Rights and Equal Opportunities did not endorse on Thursday a proposal to suspend construction of the C0 sewerage project on the outskirts of Ljubljana, which raises concern about its impact on drinking water.","The commission did endorse the proposals to urge relevant authorities to check all the permits and the legal basis for the Ljubljana municipality's actions in relation to the owners of the land where the C0 channel is being built.

The commission's chair Eva Irgl from the Democrats (SDS), the largest opposition party, said the commission had received a petition from a civil initiative campaigning for clean drinking water, saying that the construction of the C0 channel was a violation of human rights and the principles of the rule of law and welfare state.

Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković rejected these accusations, saying the municipality had construction permits for the whole project. He said the route of the channel had been set 30 years ago and that there was no other alternative.

""Suspending the construction is not an option, because that would be unprofessional and harmful for Ljubljana, mainly from the environmental point of view,"" he said, noting that 92% of buildings had been linked to the public sewage system in the last 15 years and 6,400 cesspits were yet to be closed. It is those cesspits that are a danger to the underground water, he said.

This was echoed by the head of the Ljubljana utility company Voka Snaga, David Polutnik, who said that the C0 channel would make the water in Ljubljana ""even better"".

Acting chief environmental inspector Martina Gašperlin confirmed Janković's claim that inspections had not detected any irregularities and noted that construction was under way in sections for which permits had been obtained.

Representatives of NGOs expressed opposition to the project warning of the risks that the construction of the channel through a very sensitive water protection area poses and the fact that an environmental consent had not been obtained for a certain section, which was confirmed by Tanja Bolte from the Environment Ministry.

Deputies of the ruling Freedom Movement said that the route of the channel had been set by experts. ""After all that we've heard at an emergency session a month ago, it is clear that construction is under way in sections for which permits had been obtained,"" said Nataša Avšič Bogovič.

Nataša Sukić from the Left, a junior coalition party, said that if clean drinking water was at risk the least that should be done was to wait for an environment impact assessment.",environmental issue
Agriculture minister stresses importance of biodiversity at Berlin forum,"Agriculture Minister Irena Šinko took part in the 15th Berlin Agriculture Ministers' Conference as part of the International Green Week in Berlin on Saturday, discussing the transformation of food systems as a response to the many crises. She stressed the importance of preserving biodiversity.","Transforming food systems until 2030 is a key goal set by the international community, which is why it is also the theme of this year's Global Forum and the Berlin Agriculture Ministers' Conference, which aims to encourage debate and global and national cooperation, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food said.

Four panels discussed ways to create crisis-resilient food systems, climate-friendly food systems, ways to preserve biodiversity and improve cooperation on sustainable global food systems.

Šinko participated in a panel on biodiversity, where she stressed that the essential role of politics was to raise awareness in society, to make farmers and other citizens become aware of the importance of preserving animal and plant species. She said each individual and whole sectors should be ready to invest efforts into preserving or improving the current situation. These activities must be funded in the long term.

She presented the situation in Slovenia, where forests cover 60% of land and 38% of land is included in the Natura 2000 protected areas. She also touched on the conservation of biodiversity in the context of increasing agricultural production and stressed the importance of cooperation between countries in exchanging knowledge in this field.

Listing some examples of best practices in biodiversity conservation, she mentioned the preservation of the mosaic structure of agricultural land and forests in Slovenia, the preservation of habitats of pollinators and the orientation towards organic farming.

In the long term, there are no easy solutions and it will take a lot of effort to achieve the set goal, she said. ""Agricultural policy has to address this, otherwise the consequences will be bad not only for wildlife but also for humanity,"" she stressed.

Today's summit, attended by more than 70 ministerial delegations from around the world and representatives of the European Commission, the African Union, agricultural institutions and associations and other international organisations, concluded with the adoption of a message on the global response to the current crises.

The event was part of the Green Week international trade fair, which opened its doors to visitors on Friday. Slovenia is presented as a green and organic country at the fair, which runs until 29 January. The Agriculture Ministry's stand showcases Slovenia's three wine-growing regions, winemaking and the top Slovenian cuisine. Special emphasis is also placed on beekeeping and Slovenia as a tourist destination, the ministry said earlier this week.",environmental issue
Vrhnika successfully appeals permit granted to waste treatment plant Kemis,"The Administrative Court has ruled in favour of an appeal of the Vrhnika municipality against a building and environmental permit granted by the government to the Kemis waste treatment plant in March, six years after a major fire broke out at the facility.","Vrhnika's officials were up in arms after Kemis received a building permit for several facilities, including to rebuild the Recycling Centre, its main hazardous waste facility. It did so as part of an ""integral procedure"" that allowed it to avoid an environmental impact assessment.

The municipality said on Thursday that the Administrative Court had now told the Environment Ministry to execute substantive environmental impact assessment, as demanded by the municipality.

While the ministry said it had not received the court's decision yet and could not comment, the municipality wrote the government had been ""completely deaf"" to the demand of the local population that Kemis, which has been processing hazardous waste uninterrupted since the 2017 fire, be finally brought in line with the EU directive on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances.

""The very procedure that Kemis refuses to initiate would establish that the hazardous activity in a residential area does not comply with EU safety requirements,"" the municipality's representatives wrote.

""Although both European and Slovenian law require that installations posing a risk of major accidents should not be operated without a special permit, Kemis has avoided the procedure due to the passivity of the competent state institutions,"" the municipality argued.

It moreover pointed to two Supreme Court decisions that found that the state's and Kemis's reliance on the ""final"" permit was unjustified and that the state had the duty and the power to act, rather than waiting for the polluters themselves to request an assessment of their own operations.

Although a legislative change has removed the time limit on the validity of the permit, adaption to any change in operation and also to changes in regulations and requirements is necessary. Compliance with all regulatory requirements is necessary at all times, the municipality quoted the court as saying.

""If the permit or installation does not meet the conditions currently in force, this is grounds for modification or withdrawal of the permit,"" the municipality added.

It expects another decision from the Administrative Court, which will, on the basis of these guidelines from the Supreme Court, instruct the ministry on how to ensure protection against the risks of major accidents in the Kemis case.

""The municipality has proposed that the ministry prohibit or stop the operation of Kemis, which endangers the municipality and its people, until a final decision is adopted,"" the press release adds.

The 2017 fire broke out in an area where some 1,400 tonnes of waste were stored, with several explosions heard during the fire, which caused mainly pollution to the local stream. Ever since the locals have wanted Kemis to move out of Vrhnika, but the company soon started rebuilding the facilities.",environmental issue
Dnevnik comments on rivalry between renewables and nuclear energy,"The newspaper Dnevnik says in its commentary on Saturday that a rivalry has been created between renewables and nuclear energy, with the former allegedly undermining the latter. The nuclear energy lobby uses any opportunity it gets to point to the German model, labelling it a failed energy policy.","There is much money in the energy sector and lobbying is very aggressive. A part of opposition against renewables can definitely be attributed to the nuclear sector, the paper says under the headline A Single Panel Does Not a German Model Bring.

An conflict is being created between the nuclear energy and renewables and the nuclear lobbyists are quick to point to the failed German model.

But such comparisons are nothing but populist talk. There is no evidence that Slovenia will follow the German model.

""It we want to follow the increasingly strict EU demands for decarbonisation, we will need all the low-carbon and no-carbon sources available to us, and the cooperation of all those in charge of the country's energy policy.

It will be expensive, but Slovenia's non-existent energy policy is already costing the country very dearly.",environmental issue
"Farmers give up on talks with govt, announce new rally","Representatives of farmers, who have been at loggerheads with the government over environmental and other restrictions and policies they said are making it near impossible to continue farming, announced on Tuesday they were giving up on negotiations after two weeks. They will organise a new protest rally next week and step up activities if needed.","Addressing the press after two weeks of talks as part of a task force set up as thousands of farmers took to the streets with their tractors in more than two dozen towns on 24 March, the farmer representatives said the negotiations with the government were not meeting their expectations.

The main demands of the farmers include the adjusting of new environmental rules so as to stay within realistic limits still allowing farming, a re-examination and reduction of Natura 2000-protected areas, the refraining from new taxes, clear and simple rules and the adjustment of direct payments and other funds they receive to cope with inflation.

They also want to see a reduction in the population of carnivores and the immediate start of effective population management. They are also calling for legislation to protect prime agricultural land and preserve it for food production, for livestock farming to be considered as the basis for sustainable farming, and for a full scrapping of the regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products at national level.

Anton Medved, president of the Trade Union of Slovenian Farmers, said that the material presented by the government in talks was flawed, misleading, and lacked legal and professional basis. ""We will no longer attend the meetings of the task force,"" Medved announced, although the farmer organisations had said they would give the taskforce a three-week grace period.

He added that the ""straw that broke the camel's back and was also very humiliating to farmers were the proposed amendments to the animal protection act"".

""We farmers are the ones who are most aware of the importance of animal protection and we strongly condemn any kind of animal torture. However, it is totally unacceptable that the proposal envisages turning livestock farms into a training ground for so-called activists who are supposed to judge the soundness of animal care by breeders on the basis of a 40-hour course,"" said Medved.

Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS) president Roman Žveglič said the proposal mocked the profession and breeders. Undoubtedly, inappropriate treatment of animals must be prevented and punished, but such a procedure requires a comprehensive professional approach, he said about the plan to introduce authorised animal protection advisers.

The chamber noted on Monday that official veterinarians undergo several years of training to perform these tasks, including six years of studying. ""Considering that advisers will be trained quickly and the activist attitude of some animal protection associations, there is justified concern that the powers will often be exceeded and that the privacy of animal attendants will be encroached on,"" the KZGS said.

Medved meanwhile added today that Slovenia farmers had never been as united as today. ""We are not demanding money or the replacement of the minister, but only the protection of the Slovenian farmer and consumer,"" he said, announcing a protest rally in Ljubljana for next Tuesday and a stepping up of industrial action if necessary.",environmental issue
Agriculture minister discussing future of forests at ministerial,"Agriculture, Forestry and Food Minister Irena Šinko attended the first informal ministerial of the For Forest Group in Kapfenberg, Austria, on Tuesday to discuss the future of the EU's forestry sector and forests. Initiated by Austria, the group also includes Finland and Sweden.","The partnership of the four EU member states advocates a comprehensive approach to sustainable forest management that sees all functions of the forest - economic, environmental and social - as equally important.

The main objectives include informal dialogue in know-how exchange and understanding of how the European Commission operates, the Slovenian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food said in a press release.

Today's debate focused on the future of forests and the forestry sector in Europe. The ministers also signed a joint statement highlighting the increasingly apparent effects of climate change.

The health of forests must be strengthened long term to provide additional protection from natural disasters and ensure their ecosystemic functions in the future, the ministers believe, with Šinko describing the damage summer storms caused in Slovenian forests.

The joint statement underlined the importance of sustainable forest management and the strengthening of bioeconomy through sustainable use of forest products.

At the sidelines of the meeting, the ministers also met with a Japanese delegation, and attended the opening of Austrofoma, a forestry trade fair.",environmental issue
New app to help Slovenia tackle food waste,"Three Slovenian entrepreneurs have developed an app to help reduce food waste. The Plate (Krožnik), as the app has been dubbed, will allow users to buy food that would otherwise be thrown away at a discounted price. The launch of the app is planned for this autumn.","Users will be able to buy food at least 50% cheaper by using the app, co-founder Marcel Nahtigal said at the development forum for the Gorenjska region in April.

Every year more than 2.5 billion tonnes of food are wasted globally, which is a third of all food produced. In 2021, more than 140,000 tonnes of food were wasted in Slovenia, Nahtigal said.

Food waste is an added cost for retailers as it has to be purchased, stored and disposed of. It is also detrimental to the environment as calculations show that eliminating food waste would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 to 10%.

As food is becoming more expensive, the team wanted to create a solution allowing people easier and cheaper access to food that would otherwise be wasted. That includes store surplus and items close to their expiration dates.

The Plate is not just an app but a community, said Nahtigal, inviting individuals and retailers to join testing over the summer. In autumn, the app should be ready and available to users across the country.

The app will allow users to check which discounted products are available nearby, reserve them and pick them up in stores. Products will not be for sale individually but rather as bags filled with either vegetables, fruits, baked goods or a mix of everything.",environmental issue
Slovenia highlights ecology in architecture at Venice Biennale,"Slovenia's pavilion at the International Architecture Exhibition, which opens today and will run until late November, is dedicated to the principles of ecology in architecture, which have been lost in the face of advancing technology.","In the past, ecology was a part of architecture, but later architects started using technical and engineering solutions, such as heat pumps, heat recuperation and zero-energy house technologies.

This meant that they no longer applied the principles of ecology to their designs and architectural concepts, architect Eva Gusel said at the official pavilion opening earlier this week.

""Our pavilion explores how we can once again respond to ecological issues through the architectural concept, the actual construction process, through design of rooms,"" said Gusel.

She is a member of a team of architects from two firms who designed the pavilion: Maša Mertelj, Matic Vrabič and Gusel are the team of Mertelj Vrabič Arhitekti, and Anja Vidic and Jure Grohar are Vidic Grohar Arhitekti.

In their concept for the pavilion, the team looked to the past and the vernacular architecture used throughout centuries. Maja Vardjan, the commissioner of the Slovenian presentation, said this was not nostalgia but a display of knowledge from the past.

Fifty architectural teams from across Europe were invited to join the project by highlighting an example of vernacular architecture applying an energy principle. Now, five are exhibited in the Slovenian pavilion at the Arsenale venue.

Two of the examples are from Slovenia: a rustic tiled stove, which is used for heating, cooking and drying of produce, and a room within a room, a concept employed in the shepherds' huts at the Velika Planina plateau, where the temperature gradient moves from the smaller space to the larger one, a principle lost to central heating.

The third example comes from Poland and shows the principle of making a space smaller to make it more energy efficient. The pavilion also features a cocoon as a space for sleeping: its small size allows for a different organisation of the remaining rooms.

The fifth example presents the idea of a buffer zone, an expanded facade that protects the house from external impact.

Meanwhile, the pavilion itself has been made of sheep wool felt, linden wood and bricks, Grohar said at the pavilion launch.

Entitled +/- 1 °C: In Search of Well-Tempered Architecture, the display also features an exhibition of photographs by Klemen Ilovar and in June a booklet will be published. Moreover, a conference will be held in Ljubljana in the autumn, bringing together the business sector, science and culture.",environmental issue
Adapting agriculture to climate change only partly effective,"The Agriculture Ministry's efforts in adapting agriculture to climate change were only in part effective in recent years, shows a report by the Court of Audit. The ministry did ensure the implementation of measures to further these efforts, but the measures were not comprehensive, systematically planned or coordinated.","The audit, which involved the period between the start of 2018 and mid-2022, has found that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food did not consider adapting agriculture to climate change a priority.

Released on Thursday, the court's report reads that under the 2014-2020 rural development programme the ministry did ensure the implementation of measures contributing to climate change adaptation, but it failed to develop a strategy for planning such measures or to establish the weakest points in agriculture in the face of climate change.

Moreover, the ministry did finance relevant research and know-how transfer, but it failed to ensure adaptation efforts that would be comprehensive and systematically planned. Neither were they as coordinated as in the period between 2008 and 2011 when relevant measures were implemented based on a strategy and action plan.

All of this increases the likelihood of the efforts often being merely a response to crisis or disasters, and in turn costlier, the court warns.

Since farming is one of the sectors most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, Slovenia needs to start systematically adapting its agriculture to climate change, the report adds.

The ministry, which has been given a number of recommendations to remedy the situation, started turning things around already while the audit was underway by adopting an action plan to prepare a vulnerability assessment and an adaptation strategy.",environmental issue
Local community reports Salonit Anhovo to environment inspectors,Local authorities in Kanal na Soči have reported the local cement maker Salonit Anhovo to the Environmental Inspectorate over suspicion that it has violated its environmental permit requirements over 100 times in the course of the past two years.,"Talking to the press on Thursday, Mayor Miha Stegel said the move came after the city council tasked the town administration with looking into a report by Today, a local environmental civil initiative, and reporting Salonit to the authorities if needed.

Stegel, also a former member of Today, said the decision to file the report was made due to repeated violations which they believe are intentional.

""We've found over 100 violations of the environmental permit over the course of the past two years, including excessive emissions values, co-incineration of waste at too low temperatures, which is extremely dangerous to health, inappropriate handling in emergency cases, such as breakdowns of measuring devices and purification plants, and excessive values of mass flow rates of particles through the chimney.""

Moreover, after the municipality recently asked for data on temperature, the cement maker forwarded only average half-hourly figures, while the municipality had requested absolute values, said the mayor.

In the past two years, average daily limit values of nitrogen oxides were exceeded 52 times, the municipality said in its report to the inspectorate.

Moreover, waste had been co-incinerated at too low temperatures nine times, which means that the most dangerous substances, dioxins and furans, had not disintegrated. Emissions of the two substances are measured only twice a year.

The municipality also reported 15 instances of breakdowns in production, of measuring devices and of waste treatment facilities. In such cases the company could scale down or stop waste co-incineration, but had not.

There were also three cases of excessive mass flow rates through the main chimney. The environmental permit allows up to 12.4 kilogrammes of particles per hour, but the values detected were twice as high.

Moreover, the environmental permit allows the company continue operating for up to 60 hours when emission values exceed limit values. But Salonit continued to operate with too high emission values for 650 hours in 2021 and for 1,077 hours in 2022.

The municipality also suspects that emissions data in Salonit's annual reports are unrealistic, illustrating that the company decreased waste co-incineration to a quarter of the usual amount during measurements of quicksilver and chlorides, but the report stated that the plant had been operating at full capacity.

Meanwhile, Salonit issued a statement before the mayor's press conference yesterday, denying the accusations.",environmental issue

He explained that this would mean adapting agricultural production, changing land and cropping practices, which did not sit well with farmers.

Climate activists in Ljubljana warn of the severity of climate crisis,Greenpeace activists staged a performance in Ljubljana's Prešeren Square on Saturday entitled the Earth Is on Fire as part of which they burned a several-metre Earth model to warn decision-makers that climate crisis should be taken seriously.,"The NGO also launched a campaign Climate Crime, during which individuals will be highlighted who showed with their actions, statements or intentions in the last year that they do not take the climate crisis seriously, Greenpeace said in a press release.

A vote on the nominees will be held online until 16 April and the ""winner"" will be announced on 22 April, Earth Day.

According to Greenpeace activist Sara Kosirnik, the NGO would like the campaign to open debate and raise awareness of the fact that some actions are inadmissible.

Global temperature is set to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius in the first half of next decade compared to pre-industrial times, the mid-19th century. This is expected to increase the severity of climate change impacts in the near future, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report last week.

Šoštanj coal-fired plant to see limited operation in future,"The Šoštanj thermal power station (TEŠ), Slovenia's only coal-fired plant, will see its future operations limited to periods when electricity prices on the market are higher and there are shortages of electricity in Slovenia's system, Tomaž Štokelj, the CEO of energy group HSE, which also includes TEŠ, told the newspaper Dnevnik in an interview.","Štokelj cannot imagine Slovenia's energy supply without Šoštanj in the short term, ""but if we must burn expensive coal and buy costly [emission] coupons, the electricity it generates cannot be cheap"".

""If the electricity generated by the thermal plant is expensive, the question arises how many hours of its being in operation are reasonable and economically viable,"" the official said in the interview, published in the the Saturday supplement of Dnevnik.

Whether the Šoštanj plant will be off-line more often than not in the future will depend on the available volumes of domestic coal and on market prices, he said.

The volumes from the Velenje coal mine are unlikely ever to be what they used to be and Šoštanj is unlikely to generate as much as it used to, that is around four terawatt-hours per year, he assessed.

""That's why I believe TEŠ operations will be limited mainly to periods when electricity on the market is more expensive and when there is a shortage of power in our system,"" he said, adding that the supply of heat to the Šalek Valley would be a limiting factor there.

Building a modern multi-fuel boiler using biomass and other alternative fuels should be considered as soon as possible, he believes. This would make it possible to provide the valley with affordable heat and at the same time generate electricity at affordable prices.

Such a facility could use waste to generate heat, but Štokelj assumes the locals will not accept the idea that waste from all over Slovenia should be transported there. He believes it would be more appropriate to discuss co-incineration of non-hazardous waste from the valley, in return for which the locals would benefit from cheaper heating and municipal services, such as waste collection.

He believes Šoštanj will remain an energy location. HSE is planning a 140 MW solar power plant on the Šoštanj Lake and an additional 20 MW solar panels on the part of the Velenje Lake that is not suitable for tourism. Solar power plants are also planned at landfills above the coal mine and brownfield areas.

As part of the Velenje coal mine HSE also runs a wood processing company that can be upgraded. ""It would be reasonable to use wood waste for incineration in such a multi-fuel unit. A whole bunch of synergies can be found on this site, if it remains an energy site,"" Štokelj said.

Slovenia plans to phase out coal in 2033, a date that Štokelj understands as an approximate target to stop using coal. ""Whether it will be sooner or later will depend on the situation on the market and the demand for TEŠ operations,"" he said.

HSE's strategy follows the focus on renewable sources. They are planning to build hydropower stations on the central Sava and wind power plants, but their most ambitious plans are for solar power.

Once the Šoštanj thermal plant is closed and with the construction of many solar and wind power plants, the need for flexibility resources will increase, so plans are under way to build three pumped storage power plants, to upgrade the Avče pumped storage power plant, and procure battery storage and electrolysers for green hydrogen production.

Štokelj does not see a scenario where Slovenia would rely on renewables for all its electricity needs viable for at least the next 20 years.

""As an alternative to TEŠ and the nuclear power station, we would need gas power plants that would later use hydrogen instead of natural gas. But such a scenario is dangerous because of dependency on gas imports. At the same time, I don't think hydrogen will be economically viable for quite some years. I'm convinced that Slovenia needs one reliable production base, say the nuclear power station, which can be upgraded with renewable energy sources,"" he said.",environmental issue
Štajerska businesses warn of growing uncertainty,"The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Štajerska has warned that many companies in the north-eastern region are looking to move abroad due to the growing uncertainty, including because of difficulties in obtaining environmental permits and the expected negative effects of the recent changes to the act on cross-border services.","Representatives of the chamber told a press conference in Maribor on Thursday that it was increasingly worrying that due to various issues that cause uncertainty in the business environment, there was a growing number of companies that are looking to move abroad.

President of the chamber Roman Glaser noted that the crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic had extended into a crisis of energy and general costs, affecting both households and businesses.

Businesses are facing major tasks in adapting to new requirements, including in the green transformation, which will ""eat into the economic structure of companies"" since adaptation will not be cheap and it will not be quick, he added.

Director of the chamber Aleksandra Podgornik pointed to the issue of the water act, as it is perceived as increasing uncertainty for businesses and prevents development due to its vagueness.

A year ago the Administrative Court changed case law when it comes to environmental approvals issued by the competent bodies as it is not specified clearly enough what companies can and cannot do in water protection areas.

Businesses are waiting for approvals for too long, Podgornik added, noting that in addition to Magna Steyr, which is closing its paint shop in Hoče, other companies in the Podravje region are affected.

""Companies do not want to violate the law, let alone build on their development on shaky, unclear foundations. They prefer to move to environments where there are no such uncertainties,"" she said.

Noting the case of Magna Steyr, Podgornik said that ""we are afraid that there will be many such cases in the region very soon.""

Chamber representative Albert Kekec added that companies are facing another problem in the recently passed changes to the act on cross-border services that strike out a provision on payment of lower pension contributions for certain posted workers.

He said that this would result in additional labour costs and prompt many companies to start thinking about moving abroad or cancelling deals.",environmental issue
Major water pollution incident detected in Ljubljana Marshes (adds),"Researchers have detected by chance a major water pollution incident in the Ljubljana Marshes landscape park, which could have been caused by sludge from waste water treatment plants. The discovery has been reported to the park authorities, relevant inspectorate and police. Locals meanwhile say that this could be a natural phenomenon.","What is believed to be deliberate pollution of the Ljubljanica River basin was detected on Sunday by members of the Geography Department of the Ljubljana Faculty of Arts and the Anton Melik Geographical Institute.

As physical geography professor Uroš Stepišnik told the STA, the pollution was detected during routine work on the ground, on the Bevški Jarek Creek, a left tributary of the Ljubljanica, between Bevke and Notranje Gorice, SW of Ljubljana.

Stepišnik said that the visible signs of pollution were the very dark colour of the water in the Bevški Jarek, adding that the entire course of the Ljubljanica after the confluence was also black. The water also smells.

The Geography Department has carried out water quality tests, which showed contamination with organic material of natural origin.

Stepišnik noted that the oxygen content in the water of the Bevški Jarek was only 12.4%. Phosphate and chloride levels are also noticeably elevated, he said, adding that analyses of the presence of heavy minerals were still under way.

It is believed that the contamination will also affect the water of the Ljubljanica at the confluence with the creek.

During the recent floods, the contaminated water spilled over into the surroundings, resulting in the vegetation on extensive meadows and fields outside the riverbed dying out. The polluted Ljubljanica also flows through the centre of Ljubljana.

""We assume that the pollution is the result of the discharge of sludge from waste water treatment plants into the tributary, something that had already been observed in the past in other areas of Slovenia,"" Stepišnik said.

He added that more detailed analyses in reference laboratories, which would follow as part of the official investigation, would hopefully confirm this assumption.

According to him, the perpetrators had believed that the forecasted heavy rains, which subsequently caused major floods, would quickly wash the sludge away and that no one would detect another case of illegal dumping of sludge.

The incident has been reported to the relevant inspectorate, the operator of the Ljubljana Marshes landscape park and the police. The police are on the ground, Stepišnik said.

He labelled it as ""unacceptable violation of environmental standards"", and called on the authorities to take measures to rehabilitate the affected area in order to prevent the damage from spreading and re-establish the natural balance.

Stepišnik noted that the affected area was part of a Natura 2000 nature protection site and that it constituted the central part of the Ljubljana Marshes landscape park.

On the other hand, some experts and locals say that the blackish water and foul smell is a consequence of typical decay of organic matter after floods. Such occurrences in less severe forms had already been observed in the area before.

The state of the water in the Bevški Jarek is most likely a natural phenomenon, Jernej Lenarčič, the head of the local community, told the STA on Tuesday.

He said that a few days after the floods, an unbearable stench started spreading in the vicinity of Bevke. Everything that grew in the area where the water stood for ten, twelve days has died out, and a lot of moles and mice were also killed.

Long-term flooding in the area always leaves such consequences, Lenarčič said, noting that the difference was that this time the phenomenon was much more intense due to high temperatures, abundant vegetation and a greater number of killed animals.

He thus believes that the state of the creek is not a consequence of pollution with sludge, which he finds ""completely illogical"", as the amount of the dumped sludge would have to be extremely large.

The Municipality of Ljubljana also operates with two opposing unofficial pieces of information - Mayor Zoran Janković said that the event was either a normal phenomenon, or a consequence of something having been dumped in the water.

Janković noted that the state of the Ljubljanica was being measured at four points and that only some microbiological parameters had been exceeded. ""If we detect anything, we will notify the relevant services,"" he told the press.

Janez Kastelic, the director of the landscape park, said that an inspection on the ground had been carried out and that one should wait for the official results of analyses before any conclusions were made.

The Environment and Energy Inspectorate told the STA it had been notified about the event today and that an inspection procedure would be launched. The site is to be inspected today.",environmental issue

Freedom Movement expels two members for undermining party unity (adds),"The Freedom Movement has expelled MP Mojca Šetinc Pašek and Robert Pavšič, a senior aide to National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič, over what the party president, Prime Minister Robert Golob, said was an attempt to undermine the party's unity. The council and executive committee endorsed the decision unanimously.","The decision came as a surprise in the aftermath of a series of media reports on Tuesday suggesting that a deep rift had opened up between Golob and Klakočar Zupančič and that Golob had urged the National Assembly president to step down, apparently due to her refusal recently to vote for the dismissal of the agriculture minister.

Golob described these reports as ""malevolent misinformation"" planted in the media by malicious actors. He said he was amazed at how ""media reality was so far from the actual situation"" and noted that the media were ""victims"" of planted information.

He said he sometimes wonders where the media get their information. ""I've read about my own resignation a number of times in the media, but this is a movie that Janez Janša will not see,"" he said in reference to the opposition leader.

As for the two expelled members, Golob said that ""someone who does not believe that you have to play for your own team and keeps playing for a different team all the time has no place on our team.""

Šetinc Pašek, a former journalist, was one of the earliest members of the Freedom Movement, whereas Pavšič joined the party when it merged with the Marjan Šarec List, a party for which he was an MP in the previous parliament. Neither immediately responded to STA's requests for comment.

While staying on as National Assembly president, Klakočar Zupančič has decided to step down as vice-president of the party saying that she wanted to focus on the important job of running parliament. She will be replaced as vice-president by Sara Žibrat, a 31-year-old MP.

She said she was stepping down as party vice-president due to excessive workload and to prevent the post of parliament president from becoming ""a nexus of disputes or the launching pad for rifts.""

Golob also announced a deliberation about a cabinet reshuffle and a reduction of the number of ministries, less than a year after his government expanded the number of ministries in a process that took months and involved a referendum at which the expansion was confirmed.

When it comes to a government reshuffle ""everything is open"" as he spoke about a ""radical reduction"" in the number of ministries, saying that ""even twelve is a high number"".

There are currently 20 ministers in the Robert Golob government.

""We don't know what the reaction by the coalition partners will be, but we've realised over the past year, in particular in the response to the floods, that coordination among a large number of ministries ... becomes a drag on government effectiveness.""

""We plan to have a candid discussion about that with the coalition partners.""",politics
Mayors hope Brežan's departure speeds up post-flood reconstruction,"Mayors of some municipalities hit by floods expect a change at the helm of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning to result in faster post-flood reconstruction and in the promises made being delivered. Others are more reserved, not expecting much change, while some praise Minister Uroš Brežan's good work.","Sceptical about the effect the change will have, Mayor of Ljubno ob Savinji Franjo Naraločnik said ""if replacing the minister also means that 'the body' will change, then I guess his departure is good"".

Local communities would like the government to play a more active role on the ground in that government commissions that were promised would visit them and that technical offices would be set up, he said, adding that Brežan's resignation would probably have no impact on the final result the local communities would like to see.

The mayor said that whenever he had called either Brežan or Boštjan Šefic, head of the government's reconstruction service, ""they always get back to me"".

""What is missing is results on the ground. We'd like to have a person who could be involved right now in preparation of these awkward municipal spatial plans of ours,"" Naraločnik told the STA on Thursday.

This would facilitate permitting, which is not only up to the minister but many other services at lower levels, he said, pointing a finger at public servants in Ljubljana, who he said are far from the affected municipalities.

Dravograd Mayor Anton Preksavec said the floods showed the minister must be capable of fast decisions and decisive action, while his team must be able to execute them.

""I hope that with a new minister watercourses will get the much-needed care, not only now because of the floods but in general, to have supervision over how work is done ..., so that we don't tremble every time there's a bit more rain.""

Preksavec agrees with those who say the work on watercourses should be done faster, and with some direct support by the minister, which be believes lacked in this case.

Milan Čadež, mayor of Gorenja Vas - Poljane, was meanwhile surprised by Brežan's replacement, saying ""he was really a good minister"".

""He has been on the ground a lot, among the people, taking into account what experts and the people told him, and it really surprised me that he ... will be replaced.""

In Čadež's view, the country has not had such a minister for some time. ""It's clear he has experience, knows what's needed. I hope the new minister will do similar, it will be difficult to do better.""",politics
NSi will not sign SDS motion against government,"New Slovenia (NSi) will not contribute its signatures for the interpellation motion against the government lodged by the fellow opposition Democrats (SDS), said NSi president Matej Tonin at a press conference on Tuesday, adding that the motion will only serve to strengthen the coalition.","The NSi will stay away from ouster motions in the future, said Tonin, noting that the party has reconsidered their policy after failing to collect the signatures for the interpellation of Culture Minister Asta Vrečko in January.

The party will not support the SDS-sponsored motion, since it does not propose any conclusions, which Tonin finds ""telling"". The NSi will participate in the interpellation to discuss and ""warn about the missteps of the coalition"".

Even though Tonin is critical of the government, saying that it failed to do what it promised and that many announced reforms will not be passed, the NSi is still willing to work with the government in preparing the healthcare reform.

People expect that a responsible opposition would provide alternative solutions, said Tonin, adding that the NSi will hold a programme conference on Saturday to present its ideas for healthcare reform. They are coordinating constitutional changes and will prepare solutions to improve the business environment. The NSi called on the rest of the opposition to do the same.

When everyone chooses politics ""for"", rather than ""against"", the centre-right will begin to win again, said Tonin. The NSi has prepared recommendations for the government and National Assembly to strengthen the values of Slovenian independence, thus forcing MPs to take a stance on specific policies, said Tonin.

The SDS responded by saying its motion came in response to a call by Lojze Peterle, the founder of the precursor to the NSi and the head of the Association of Values of Slovenian Independence (VSO). ""The call was addressed to all political parties, including the NSi.""

One of the main reasons for the motion against the government is the merger of the Museum of Slovenian Independence, which was incepted under the coalition government that included the SDS and NSi, with the Museum of Contemporary History.

The VSO has hailed interpellation of the government as well as the NSi's recommendations to conduct a broader argument-based debate on the significance of independence as a core value of all Slovenians.

""After the government has rejected any dialogue, we see interpellation as an opportunity to reconsider the abolishment of the Museum of Slovenian Independence and a call to understanding Slovenian independence and statehood in order to enhance the national, patriotic and democratic identity,"" the VSO said.

Another issue of contention between the SDS and the NSi is the distribution of seats on the parliamentary commissions for the oversight of public finances and intelligence services. The SDS has still not appointed its members to the two opposition-controlled commissions.

This is the reason why the NSi would not contribute signatures that the SDS needs to open a parliamentary inquiry into GEN-I, the energy company that Robert Golob run before becoming prime minister. The two parliamentary commissions have oversight of all state-owned companies.

""Let's first establish parliamentary oversight of the whole field and we can then go for individual inquiries,"" Tonin said. The NSi has collected signatures for the GEN-I inquiry, but it ""depends fully on the SDS"" when the inquiry commission will be established.",politics
"President talks Ukraine, W Balkans, culture and sport with German counterpart","In what is her second visit abroad after being sworn in, President Nataša Pirc Musar met her German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin on Thursday. Discussing topical issues such as climate change, the Western Balkans and the war in Ukraine, the pair pointed to Slovenia's and Germany's shared positions and excellent relations.","Steinmeier said he was glad to host Slovenia's first woman president of the country with which Germany had long fostered a deep friendship, adding that despite its small size, Slovenia had achieved great things.

The pair discussed global challenges, especially the war in Ukraine, which both condemned and stressed it was Russia who was the aggressor. Pirc Musar and Steinmeier avoided commenting on potential peace initiatives or further military aid to Ukraine.

Steinmeier underlined last year's successful cooperation between Slovenia and Germany in supplying Ukraine with firearms, and Pirc Musar said Europe should remain unanimous is supporting the war-stricken country.

Slovenia can not offer Ukraine large-scale support, Pirc Musar said, adding that taking into account the size of its population, the country is already one of the five biggest donors, having provided EUR 23 million-worth of aid.

Discussing the Western Balkans' integration efforts, the German president welcomed Pirc Musar's engagement in the Brdo-Brijuni Process, with both presidents saying it was time to overcome nation-dividing ideologies, and turn focus to climate change, biodiversity and young people.

Pirc Musar confirmed that the next Brdo-Brijuni meeting will take place in North Macedonia. Croatian President Zoran Milanović agreed to let her choose the main topic, she said. Steinmeier shared her view that the Brdo-Brijuni Process does not conflict with the Berlin process.

Talking biodiversity, the presidents underscored cooperation and Slovenia's involvement in Germany's car production, in light of efforts towards a green future.

The two also noted that Slovenia will be the guest of honour at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the largest book fair of its kind in Europe, in October this year. ""Whether it be culture, sport or politics, we are happy to have you by our side,"" Steinmeier said.",politics
Fajon: Slovenia on track to becoming UN Security Council member,"Slovenia is on track to succeed at the elections for non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said on Friday, adding that the country had received positive signals in the past week, so her team was becoming more optimistic ahead of the vote in New York.","The UN General Assembly will hold elections for new non-permanent members of the UN Security Council for 2024 and 2025 on 6 June, with Slovenia, along with Belarus, vying for a seat in the Eastern European Group. To be elected, a country needs the support of a two-thirds of the countries voting.

Addressing the press on Friday, Fajon did not disclose the number of countries whose support Slovenia is counting on. The vote is secret and all expressions of support have to be taken with a grain of salt, noted the Foreign Ministry.

""The temperature is rising in a good way, as we are receiving some more support in the last days. I hope it is not deceiving us, but the feeling is good,"" Fajon said.

Slovenia launched its campaign at the end of 2021, under the government of Janez Janša. Compared to Belarus, which submitted its candidacy in 2007, Slovenia has had significantly less time to garner support. Still, Fajon is pleased with the campaign.

During the campaign, she held talks with representatives of 150 countries and her team established contacts with almost 190 countries. No talks were held only with Russia, Belarus, Syria, Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

""I would like to see all the contacts we have made continue, so that we can benefit from them, including in economic terms,"" she said. ""This is an incredible opportunity for Slovenia,"" Fajon added.

The minister believes that Slovenia will prove itself a reliable country that will know how to strengthen trust in the Security Council and cooperate with all parts of the world and understand their problems.

Slovenian representatives have faced criticisms about Europe's inconsistency and that Europe is forgetting conflicts elsewhere in the world because of the war in Ukraine. ""It is important that we understand problems in other parts of the world and that we are not dismissive,"" Fajon said.",politics
Left to elect new leadership in September,"Left, one of the ruling coalition parties, will pick party leadership for the next two years in early September but it is not clear yet whether the incumbent leader Luka Mesec will stand for the top job.","The new party council, elected at the party congress in June, will hold a maiden session in late August and the decision who will head the party over the next two years will be known in early September, the Left said on Wednesday.

The party's internal rules set out that the maiden session of the 25-strong council be called 21 days after the congress at which the members were elected. The congress was held in early June.

Registration of candidates for the party leader, deputy leader and members of the executive committee will be held in July and August. Only council members can stand.

""After the congress, the Left has engaged in internal dialogue to provide answers what policies the party will pursue, how it will navigate between the government and the party environment, and who will form the new party leadership,"" the Left said in a press release.

Before the congress Mesec had declared he would seek re-election as party leader, but after he only placed fourth in the council election he said he would ask the party to say whether he should continue as leader.

Out of the 25 council members elected in June, 15 come from the more radical left wing, represented by MP Miha Kordiš, who has been critical of Mesec's leadership and the party's record in the government.

Kordiš also won the most votes in the council vote.

Mesec, who serves as labour minister, has been leading the party since its inception in June 2017 through the merger of two leftist parties, one of which was run by him.

Employers and unions want PM's assurances of social dialogue,"Dissatisfied with the level of social dialogue as displayed by certain ministries, employers and trade unions in the Economic and Social Council (ESS) call on Prime Minister Robert Golob to attend a session in late June to give assurances that they would be treated as equal partners.","Jakob Počivavšek, head of the Pergam trade union confederation, pointed to violations of ESS rules in coordinating legislative proposals with the council.

Representatives of employers and trade unions expect the prime minister to attend the 23 June session and assure them that they would be treated as equal partners and that conditions for social dialogue would be established, Počivavšek told a press conference after the ESS session on Friday.

What is expected, he said, is what the prime minister promised at the start of his term when social dialogue was resumed after a hiatus under the previous government.

Ministries which are under most pressure to prepare the planned reforms, particularly the Health Ministry, violate ESS rules most often, in addition to newly-formed ministries, said Mitja Gorenšček, representative of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In a way the council understands the time pressure the government faces in reform efforts, but it still demands enough time for social dialogue to be respected.",politics
MEP welcomes EU Parliament committee's okaying media legislation,"The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education approved on Thursday an amended version of the European Media Freedom Act, obligating member states to ensure media plurality and protect media independence. Slovenian MEP Irena Joveva said that the legislation would prevent harmful practices.","An MEP of Renew and the Freedom Movement, the former journalist was involved in negotiations on the changes. She believes that the European Freedom Act is the most decisive step to ensure media freedom.

""The EU is finally getting the tool to fight threats against the media, and I sincerely hope that the European Commission will be consistent in implementing the act,"" said Joveva.

Proposed by the European Commission last year and initiated in part because of Slovenia's previous government's withholding of funds from the STA, the draft act will obligate member states to provide multi-year budgets for public media outlets and to prevent political meddling, among other things.

The proposal also prohibits any form of interference or pressure against the media, including pressing journalists to reveal their sources, breaking into encrypted contents on their devices and using spyware.

Under the act, the media would be obligated to reveal their owners and who is benefiting from them. The European Parliament also want the media to report advertising commissioned by the state and state aid, including funds from non-EU members.

Moreover, media service providers are also to be obligated to report any potential conflict of interest or attempts at interfering in editorial decisions, under the act, which entails several other provisions.

Before the changes are discussed with the Council of the EU, they have to be voted on by the European Parliament. This will expectedly take place at the plenary in early October.

The European Commission, the Council and the Parliament wish to reach an agreement on the draft act before the European Election in June 2024.

Meanwhile, MEP Romana Tomc (EPP/SDS) has been in correspondence about the media with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over the summer. In June, Tomc wrote to von der Leyen that Slovenia's incumbent government had taken over public broadcaster RTV Slovenija.

To this von der Leyen replied in late August that the Commission was dedicated to protecting free and independent media, with Tomc accusing her in her most recent letter of either not knowing the facts or of employing double standards.

Tomc first wrote to von der Leyen after the Constitutional Court cleared the use of an act that allowed the reshaping of the governance structure at RTV Slovenija, which subsequently led to the dismissal of several managers who had been appointed by the previous government.",politics
POP TV poll shows decline in govt rating,"The government's approval rating plunged to below 50% following a brief surge right after the August floods, according to a poll by POP TV, which also shows the two top parties neck-and-neck, both having recorded significant losses on the month before.","After an eight-point surge in August, the share of those who support the government plunged by seven points to 44.9% as the number of those who think it is doing a poor job rose by four points to 38.9%.

The largest opposition party, the Democrats (SDS), edged ahead of the ruling Freedom Movement to poll at 21%, down more than two points. The Freedom Movement, at 20.8%, lost almost two points.

Govt to set out tax reform in mid-March,The government will set out its proposal of tax reform in mid-March with Prime Minister Robert Golob telling MPs on Monday they would like to make the rich pay a fair share of the tax burden.,"Golob made the announcement in response to a question by opposition MP Jožef Horvat, who expressed concern that the taxpayers would pay for the projects planned by the government with higher taxes.

The New Slovenia (NSi) MP listed government promises of a public sector pay reform, a bonus for judges and prosecutors, abolishment of top-up health insurance, improvements in healthcare and construction of 30,000 new public rental apartments. ""Who will pay for it all?"" Horvat wondered.

Golob said most of the plans would not require a single euro more because the required funding had been secured in the 2023 and 2024 budgets that had been passed by parliament. ""Thus it's rather irresponsible trying to scare citizens as if these were new funds.""

The government has not announced anything new, he said. The same is true of the tax reform, which they announced before the election and set down in the coalition agreement.

He promised reducing the tax wedge on wages but ""first we intend to see to it that wealth is appropriately valued and that those who have much more wealth than most others will pay fair tax on that property"".

He would not go into details. The coalition parties are first planning to talk tax reform through at a meeting on 15 March, when more should also transpire about their pension reform plans. The government has already outlined its plans to reform healthcare, housing policy and the public sector pay system.",politics
"Coalition reserved about minister's costly trip, NGO funding","Coalition partners are reserved in their comments of a costly trip to New York of Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik and the ministry's allegedly controversial granting of funds to an NGO led by the minister's former business partner. Her party, the ruling Freedom Movement, says the ministry enjoys the party's full trust.","Ajanović Hovnik recently raised dust as she and four of the ministry employees took part in a forum on sustainable development held in New York in July, with the price tag of the trip topping EUR 33,000. Now she is in the spotlight because NGO Gender Equality Research Institute, headed by Kaja Primorac, the minister's former business partner, won the most funds in a recent public call for applications published by the Public Administration Ministry.

The Commission for Prevention of Corruption is already looking into the controversial New York trip, and plans to investigate the granting of funding to the NGO as well.

The minister has rejected the criticism and insists the price of the trip was reasonable, while the ministry said yesterday she had nothing to do with the distribution of funds but merely signed the papers.

Freedom Movement MP Tereza Novak said today that Ajanović Hovnik enjoyed full trust of the deputy group. ""The minister was not involved in the process [of deciding on granting funds], she was not in the commission, and no one from her cabinet was involved in it,"" Novak repeated the ministry's statement.

Any irregularities, which Novak said she was sure did not exist, could be investigated by the competent authorities. Novak said Slovenia was a small country, so ""if ten people get together probably two will know each other"".

As for the New York trip, she said that Slovenia is part of the world and that it was important that its officials and politicians understand this world, get educated and have international contacts.

The junior coalition Left party said it expected the inquiries into the two cases to bring results shortly. ""We will talk based on these findings,"" said the head of the deputy group, Matej Tašner Vatovec. The Left also expects the prime minister to take action based on these findings.

The junior coalition Social Democrats (SD) would not comment today. The party head, Tanja Fajon, said yesterday that everyone had to explain their own travel costs, and that the minister had provided an explanation.

Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan, also an SD member, said the matter was being blown out of proportions because of ongoing negotiations on the public sector pay system.

Prime Minister Robert Golob also backed the minister earlier this week. He said that ""if the biggest problem of this country is the minister's EUR 6,000 trip to New York, we live in a happy country"".",politics
President congratulates Croatia on EU accession anniversary,"President Nataša Pirc Musar congratulated Croatia on the 10th anniversary of its EU accession. ""Together we are continuing along the path heading toward a strong Europe and a European future for the Western Balkans,"" she tweeted.","Croatia became a member of the EU on 1 July 2013, three years after Slovenia withdrew its veto in the wake of the signing of a border arbitration agreement.

Under the treaty, the countries agreed to resolve their border dispute in front of an international arbitration tribunal. However, Croatia refuses to recognise the decision delivered by the tribunal in 2017.

To mark the occasion, former presidents of Croatia and Slovenia who brokered and signed the treaty, Jadranka Kosor and Borut Pahor, met in Metlika today.",politics
Večer: Defence purchases could upset relations in coalition,The newspaper Večer says in Saturday's commentary Defence that defence will be another area where the ability of the Robert Golob government will be tested as the defence minister is promising more spending while the Left is an opponent of defence spending and as soldiers too demand higher pay and are threatening with a strike.,"In its first months in office, Golob's government cancelled the purchase of Boxer APCs, fulfilling a pledge from the coalition agreement.

Now Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said that ""after several dry years, the time has come for more upbeat budgets"", and even announced buying a new transport aircraft.

Večer says this is probably the right decision from the aspect of the army and defence experts because the plane can also be used for rescue and disaster relief, and because the defence minister should promote the development of the army.

However, at political level, the situation is not that simple, Večer says highlighting the Left's opposition to NATO and defence purchases, which opens up the question of what the government's shift towards strengthening defence capabilities means for relations within the coalition.

Golob is getting into more and more trouble when it comes not only to the question of national defence but also of defending the interests of particular groups within the public sector. ""His partial promises to improve the financial situation of individual groups are already backfiring in the area of defence.""

A seemingly innocent promise of higher salaries for assistant teachers in kindergarten is now making soldiers feel being worse off, prompting a trade union of soldiers to demand higher pay and threaten with a protest rally.

The situation clearly shows the difference between running a company such as Gen-I, where Golob could reward staff according to his own liking, and running the government where a well-intended move to raise wages in education and judiciary triggers discontent among tens of thousands of members of another public sector group.

""This is the art of searching for political balance which shows how able those in power are,"" concludes the commentary.",politics
Police checks at border extended until 19 November,"Slovenia will extend police checks at the border with Croatia and Hungary by another 20 days, until 19 November, the government decided on Friday. The checks will focus on preventing terrorism, extremism and cross-border crime, it said.","Slovenia reinstated border checks on 21 October, the same day that Italy reinstated checks at the Slovenian border, citing heightened security risks due to organised crime gangs and the escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

The government listed the same reasons today saying the checks had been introduced to protect internal security and due to terrorist threats.

The checks performed by Slovenian police officers are not systematic, instead the police focuses on potentially suspect vehicles and passengers.

Once the new extension ends, police checks are likely to be additionally extended by a month, the Interior Ministry told the STA this week.

Border checks will be the main topic of talks at a meeting of the interior ministers of Croatia, Italy and Slovenia scheduled to take place in Trieste on 2 November.

They will also top the agenda as Prime Minister Robert Golob visits his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in mid-November.

"Golob, Bettel agree all EU candidates should be treated equally (adds)","Prime Minister Robert Golob held talks wit his Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bettel in Luxembourg on Tuesday to agree that all countries that want to join the EU should be treated equally. They also visited the village of Schengen and discussed business cooperation, especially in space technologies, ahead of a bilateral business forum.","""Enlargement was a technical issue for 20 years, meaning being virtually left to the European Commission and the fulfilment of technical criteria. The view has changed somewhat due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the process is becoming an increasingly geopolitical issue,"" Golob said at a joint press conference with Bettel.

He added that Slovenia was in touch with the European Commission in order to clearly present its position - that the Western Balkans should be treated equally or similarly to Ukraine and Moldova when it comes to EU enlargement.

The Slovenian prime minister noted that several other EU member states agreed with such a position, while adding that, in addition to the technical conditions, the geopolitical reality must also be taken into account.

""We do not want the Western Balkans to suddenly become hostage to some foreign forces just because the Commission has not been paying attention,"" Golob said.

Bettel agreed that all countries that wish to join the EU should be treated equally, while nevertheless emphasising more the importance of compliance with the conditions.

""The rules are the same for everyone and I will insist on that,"" he said, adding that there was no system that would bypass the rules and enable faster accession.

Thus, Bettel said regarding support for the start of talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina, for which Golob called for in a recent letter to European Council President Charles Michel, that he would wait for the European Commission's report.

The Commission is expected to present an enlargement report, in which it analyses whether the candidate countries have met the various required conditions, in October.

The Slovenian and Luxembourg prime ministers also talked at the meeting about the war in Ukraine and business cooperation, especially in space technologies.

They then travelled to Schengen, a village in Luxembourg where the Schengen Agreement was signed in 1985 to abolish border controls among several EU member states.

The prime minister noted the importance of preserving the Schengen Area and free movement, which Bettel described as a great achievement. ""If we want Schengen to work, its external borders must also work,"" he said.

Golob said that Slovenia advocated for the full functioning of the Schengen Area, whose members should act responsibly at the external borders, while at the same time being aware of the benefits it brought.

He reiterated Slovenia's criticism of Austria repeatedly extending checks at the border with Slovenia.

Bettel also noted the importance of an area without border control for the economic development, which is one of the key topics of today's visit of the Slovenian prime minister.

There has been progress since Bettel's visit to Slovenia in February, Golob said, noting space technologies, where the two countries will improve cooperation by signing a memorandum on the sidelines of the Slovenia-Luxembourg business forum.

""We expect a lot from this, because Luxembourg is a sort of a pioneer in this field, and our industry is also keeping up with the pace of development in some niche areas,"" he said.

Golob believes that Slovenia and Luxembourg together will be able to create a ""success story at the European level as well"".

The business forum will also feature tourism, wood processing and furniture companies, and the direct air link between the countries' capitals, to be launched on Thursday by Luxair, the flag carrier of Luxembourg, will be presented.",politics

Golob to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Prime Minister Robert Golob will be on an official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday to discuss the country's efforts to join the EU and bilateral relations. He will meet the chair of the country's Council of Ministers Borjana Krišto, the three members of the Bosnian presidency and representatives of both chambers of parliament.","The visit is aimed at discussing bilateral relations between the two countries and ways to further improve them, the prime minister's office said.

Police investigating UKC Ljubljana employee over alleged violence against patient (adds),"Police are investigating a report of violence against a patient at an intensive care unit of the neurology clinic of the UKC Ljubljana hospital. A nurse reportedly hit a patient on the head and threaten him, web portal N1 reported on Friday.","The incident reportedly happened on 20 August, as a patient in intensive care would not cooperate in a care procedure. The nurse was allegedly so angered by this that he hit the patient on the head and mouth twice and told him he would kill him if he did not stop shouting.

The patient shared his story with several members of the staff. Subsequently, the nurse was removed from the intensive care unit, but according to N1 he was back at work in a few days although the patient in question was still there.

UKC director general Marko Jug asserted today that the employee had been in contact with the patient only on 20 August and was on sick leave the following week. When the employee returned to work, he was working in a different part of the clinic. The employee was also under constant supervision, Jug said.

The incident was immediately reported to the police and a hospital inquiry would be introduced if necessary, UKC said.

A procedure was also launched for staff training on prevention of violent communication, which is organised regularly at other UKC clinics.

If the accusations against the employee are confirmed during the investigation, he will most likely be fired, Jug said.

UKC also noted that the long-term member of staff at the neurology clinic has never been involved in any incidents of violence before. ""We have not had a similar incident at the neurology clinic, but there have been several incidents of patients being violent towards staff,"" the clinic said, adding that the safety of patients was a priority so there is zero tolerance towards violence.

Prime Minister Robert Golob responded to the incident on X, saying that he had demanded explanations about the incident. He also called for non-violence, tolerance and solidarity.

The Health Ministry also requested an explanation and called on the clinic to investigate the incident. It told the STA it asked the clinic to review its protocols and internal guidelines, ""so that patients are immediately protected in case of any sort violence.""

The report of the incident comes after Slovenia was shocked earlier this week by the news of a student working at a care home in Trebnje who harassed an elderly and posted videos of this on TikTok.",health
"Unions, employers endorse healthcare reform guidelines","The Economic and Social Council discussed on Friday the coalition's guidelines for health reform. The Association of Free Trade Unions (ZSSS) said it is one off the best health reforms to date, while employers said they supported the plan in principle.","""We hope it works this time round,"" ZZZS's Lučka Böhm told the STA. She said all stakeholders, including the public health insurer ZZZS, agreed they are working towards common goals such as reducing waiting times, retaining the scope of services covered by compulsory health insurance, and improving capacity by implementing digitalization.

Employers said they generally support the guidelines and also reiterated how important it is to shorten waiting times. Drago Delalut from the Association of Employers in Craft and Small Business of Slovenia noted that his should be the first task on the agenda.

One of the guidelines that the health ministry wishes to implement starting in 2024 is changes to the public sector pay system and an overhaul of the ZZZS.

The first stage also includes tackling the lack of general practitioners and emergency medical services, as well as setting up a uniform expert body and digitalizing the healthcare system.

The second phase will address absenteeism, concessions for private doctors and funding, changes that are to come into force in 2025.",health
Vzajemna proposes higher top-up health insurance premium,"Mutual health insurer Vzajemna has proposed the supervisory board raise the monthly top-up health insurance premium to EUR 44.78. Since it can charge only EUR 35.67 in line with the government-imposed cap, the insurer expects the government to pay the difference, chairman of the management board Aleš Mikeln said on Thursday.","""We only expect to be able to do business, we seek no profits,"" he told the press after Vzajemna asked a court last week to examine the government's 14 April decision to cap the premium and stay it.

Vzajemna has been urging changes to top-up health insurance for over a decade, because increasing health costs have made the current model unsustainable, he added.

Vzajemna posted a loss of EUR 6 million in 2022 from top-up health insurance. If the premium stays at EUR 35.67, it could finish 2023 with more than EUR 33 million in the red.

Mikeln said they see three ways of addressing the situation - the government regulation is withdrawn, the premium raised or the state covers the loss for the insurers.

The regulation on the capped premium is expected to remain in place until top-up health insurance is abolished, according to the government.

But Mikeln said the planned changes to the Health Care and Health Insurance Act only transform it from voluntary to mandatory.

He does not believe this bill is the solution, but Vzajemna nevertheless does not oppose the abolishment of top up health insurance.

The insurer is meanwhile studying all possible scenarios, including potentially terminating the contracts with its clients, he said.

Last Friday, Vzajemna filed a suit with the Administrative Court also asking it to stay to the regulation on the capped premium.

According to Rok Jemec, in charge of legal affairs at the insurer, the regulation is not in line with EU's solvency II directive, arguing the EUR 35.57 cap does not suffice to cover the obligations Vzajemna is to have to its insurees and health organisations.

The insurer also considers it unlawful, saying there is no legal grounds for the measure, so it is inappropriate and disproportionate with its consequences.

Jemec said that their further legal steps will depend on the Administrative Court's decision.

Generali, the first of the three insurers collecting top-up health insurance, has also asked the court to assess the regulation.

Supplementary health insurance was introduced in 1993 to secure more funds after mandatory health insurance - contributions from wages paid by workers and employers - was no longer enough to cover all healthcare expenses.

The new premium was first collected by the public health insurance fund ZZZS, which transferred it onto newly-founded mutual insurer Vzajemna in 1999 while it continues to collect mandatory health insurance premiums. Later on, another two insurance companies joined the supplementary health insurance scheme.

Although the top-up premium is labelled as voluntary, most people, including pensioners and the unemployed, pay them monthly as not many health services are available without it.",health
SeneCura's care home in Pivka to open in autumn,"SeneCura, a leading private care home operator in Austria, has completed the construction of a care home in Pivka and is hoping to welcome the first residents in autumn. The new care home will accept 60 to 70 residents, of whom 65 will be accepted under a concession, said Sanda M. Gavranovič, the company's business director for Slovenia.","The new care home has 50 single-bed and 10 double-bed rooms, and a multi-bed area for residents who are completely dependant on assistance, which however will still enable them to have their intimacy, said Marija Tavželj, the director of the SeneCura homes for the elderly in Pivka, Žiri and Komenda.

Clinics, rooms for therapies and physiotherapies, a kitchen and the offices of the administration are in the basement. The first floor will be reserved for residents with dementia, while rooms are on the second floor. A large garden behind the building will enable residents to socialise and spend time outdoors.

Gavranovič, who would not reveal the value of the project, said they only need staff to open. ""We would like to open the care home as soon as possible.""

Promising a pleasant and modern working environment where the know-how and experience of the staff will be respected and appreciated, Tavželj said they planned to hire 35 different professions.

The care home, which was presented to the public today, is still in the process of obtaining operating permits and hiring staff. It is also still accepting applications from future residents.

SeneCura already operates six elderly care facilities in Slovenia; apart from those in Žiri and Komenda, also in Hoče-Slivnica, Maribor, Radenci and Vojnik, and plans to build three more, in Ruše, Mislinja and Šentjernej, according to information on the company's website.",health

Acting medical director Radko Komadina said the patient had been rowdy and impatient. He arrived at the emergency ward without a referral and fled the premises after the assault but was apprehended shortly thereafter.

It is unclear why he assaulted the staff members, said Komadina. The assault happened after the patient heard that the night shift was handing over to the morning shift.

Dnevnik comments on doctors' pay deal with govt,"It is the government's task to establish an accessible healthcare system, but like all governments before it, the incumbent is rather good at avoiding this task, Dnevnik says in its commentary on Friday. Slovenia is watching history repeat itself also in deals that may affect the fate of public healthcare.","Doctors' negotiators are good at getting what they want and now the government has made them co-creators of the future of healthcare, the newspaper says under the headline Reform with Fides, referring to the doctors' and dentists' trade union.

Details about the planned special salary tier for doctors are not clear, but it is clear that the government is giving up on the public sector's single pay system.

The government's new manner of deal-making will likely push the public sector wage bill significantly higher. Already, the public health insurer plans to carry over EUR 55 million into next year, while the government has stayed mum about where it would find the additional funds needed.

The doctors' side has been less secretive. Last spring it said all licenced practitioners and private healthcare providers should be allowed to practice in the public healthcare system. More recently, it has been advocating for competition among insurers, which would strip the public healthcare insurer of its role in the system.

It seems that the government has already agreed to strictly respect the standards laid out in the document called the Blue Paper, which specified the pace of work acceptable to doctors.

The Court of Audit reviewed the document last year, saying instead of leaving this to Fides and the Medical Chamber, the government should have been involved in laying down the standards.

It seems that the decision-makers at the Health Ministry have learnt nothing from the mistakes of their predecessors, which caused the current healthcare crisis, concludes the commentary.",health

Valentina Prevolnik Rupel appointed new health minister (adds),"Economist Valentina Prevolnik Rupel, a state secretary at the Health Ministry, was appointed health minister in a 48:17 vote on Friday. She is replacing Danijel Bešič Loredan, whom PM Robert Golob asked to resign in early July over different views on how to reform the country's public healthcare. Prevolnik Rupel has already been sworn in.","Prevolnik Rupel, born in 1971, stressed better access to healthcare, high-quality services, a reform of the basket of services, and patients who don't have a named GP as her priorities during her hearing on the parliamentary Health Committee, which endorsed her candidacy on Tuesday.

She holds a PhD in economics, with her 2009 thesis focussing on healthcare financing and quality, while she has served as Health Ministry state secretary for the past three months, working closely with Golob, who stepped in as health minister. She has also been on the health council, an advisory body drafting reform proposals.

Before becoming state secretary, she was a researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Ljubljana focussing on healthcare and long-term care, while she had previously also served as adviser to the health minister and to the director general of the country's public health fund ZZZS.

Presenting his pick to MPs, Golob said today that Prevolnik Rupel had the best insight into the challenges of healthcare, which made her the best choice for the job.

She also enjoys the support of all healthcare stakeholders, which is a clear sign that she is the one who can give the most efficient solutions to the challenges ahead.

Golob is confident that she will manage to cut wait times and enable access to a GP to more patients, while her main task will be to introduce quality of health services into the way they are financed.

The MPs of all three coalition parties hailed Prevolnik Rupel's competences, but stressed that she must immediately continue the ministry's work and be efficient.

Bojana Muršič of the Social Democrats (SD) said that Prevolnik Rupel's priorities were consistent with the goals of the coalition agreement.

Since people want an accessible, high-quality and public healthcare system, while time is running out, ""the work must continue with a lot of efficiency"".

Muršič believes that Prevolnik Rupel not being a medical doctor is by no means an obstacle but an advantage as she knows the system well.

The Left expects the new minister to be foremost the bulwark of public healthcare and to be aware that the market logic must be driven out of Slovenia's healthcare.

As for Prevolnik Rupel's plans to overhaul the basket of services, MP Matej Tašner Vatovec said the Left understood it not as reducing them but as introducing more order.

The minister will also have to pun an end to a number of lobbies, including those of doctors, insurers and all the other private interests, he said.

Muršič and Tašner Vatovec urged changing the manner in which the public health fund ZZZS is funded as a prerequisite to achieve the set goals.

The SD welcomed Prevolnik Rupel's view to merge the current mandatory and voluntary health insurance contributions and suitably adjust the contribution rate to secure enough funds, while Vatovec said that new sources of funds should also be considered.

The two opposition parties, on the other hand, votd against the candidate. The Democrats (SDS) said that healthcare reform was not Prevolnik Rupel's goal anymore, while New Slovenia (NSi) said that health policy did not depend on the minister alone but on the entire coalition.

SDS MP Karmen Furman indicated that the government coalition had obviously dropped the health reform, as it had not implemented any of the announced legislative changes yet. ""There is clearly no more health reform in this coalition, so the main question here is whether the minister has a goal.""

Furman also complained Prevolnik Rupel outlined the situation in healthcare to the Health Committee but presented no solutions, including for psychotherapy.

Given her credentials, the SDS is surprised Prevolnik Rupel mentioned the basket of services as a priority while she was unable to say how she will define the basket.

NSi MP Iva Dimic said the new minister would have to act fast to tackle issues such as a shortage of staff, staff leaving abroad, staled investment, problems with the congenital heart disease department, management of medical organisations, dental care, orthodontics, digitalisation and mental health.

The NSi also expect her to tackle psychotherapy and waiting times, said Dimic, noting that despite a number of measures, waiting times have not been shortened.

In her statements before the appointment, Prevolnik Rupel indeed said that she will pursue a thought-out search for solutions and changes instead of a reform that would put healthcare upside down.

She announced several bill to address the priority areas, that is access to high-quality services. ""We'll take them on comprehensively, which means introducing gradual change step by step and in collaboration with all stakeholders, to comprehensively tackle healthcare.""

In her first statement after the appointment, Prevolnik Rupel said the work that had been set out at the ministry will be continued, and the ministry is already working on an emergency bill which will bring a number of measures.

She believes a solution will be found to the shortfall in ZZZS's revenue projected when voluntary health insurance is transformed into a mandatory contribution, which will be discussed with the Finance Ministry. Next year, the shortfall will be covered from the national budget.

As for her team, she said Marjan Pintar remains state secretary, to be joined by doctor Eva Vodnik, and Denis Kordež, deputy director at a community health centre.",health
Medical organisations worried over yet another minister departure,"Medical organisations have responded to the resignation of Health Minister Daniel Bešič Loredan with concern over the continuing failure to address burning issues in healthcare. The Medical Chamber said the constant changes at the helm of the ministry prevent reform, while private doctors said thing are returning back to square one yet again.","Following Friday's forced resignation, which Prime Minister Robert Golob indicated was due to Bešič Loredan allegedly giving a too prominent role to private practitioners, the Medical Chamber wrote that health had become extremely demanding department, where every minister had to take on what their predecessors had failed to tackle.

The chamber is concerned about the frequent changes at the helm of the ministry, saying this delayed much-needed reforms. It regrets there have been no significant shifts, let alone changes in trends, in the field of primary health care, which had for the first time been given the highest priority and support, at least declaratively.

The chamber said that public healthcare is based on its employees, which is why it expects solutions to be found in particular on how to maintain the existing public health workforce at all levels and how to provide the additional capacity that the health service will need as a result of the ageing population.

It said major reform steps require the cooperation and support of all partners and a long-term vision of the type of healthcare system desired.

Meanwhile, the Professional Association of Private Doctors and Dentists wrote that many promises could be heard recently about changes to improve patients' access to healthcare and to improve working conditions for healthcare workers, but that things were now back to square one.

""Those now acting as Bešič Loredan's loudest critics do not put patients at the heart of public health. Their concern is the existence of state health institutions, which do not treat or provide services as such. These are provided by dedicated healthcare teams - doctors, dentists, nurses, technicians, physiotherapists and others - whose numbers in the Slovenian public healthcare system are in unstoppable decline,"" the association said.

It argued that doctors' views on the issues, coordinated at the highest level and confirmed by the Medical Chamber in May, were being ignored, and that all efforts by those in power and in government are aimed at limiting, if not preventing, the activities of private actors in the public health system.

However, proposals to strengthen state-managed healthcare are not proposals to improve working conditions and increase employment flexibility, which would attract staff and improve the quality of care for patients, the private doctors added, it would only speed up the departures of doctors and the development of a real parallel system of private healthcare.

A response also came from Chamber of Nurses and Midwives, which wants health reform activities to continue and to secure a public health system that is equally accessible to all.

The chamber stressed the need for the adoption of staffing and labour standards for nurses and midwives, based on patients' needs and allowing the proper training of much needed staff.

It said that poor working conditions and low pay are issues that it has been ""warning about for years"". ""Solving them is a matter of urgency, or else the healthcare system could face collapse"".",health

Some of the main speakers include Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan, economists Mitja Čok and Petra Došenović Bonča, director of the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) Ivan Eržen and director general of public health insurer ZZZS Tatjana Mlakar.

The president sees the forums as a platform for discussions on major issues that will result in proposals which will be submitted to the government; the realisation thereof will be monitored.

Reporter sees pushback against health reform,"Reporter magazine detects pushback against health reform orchestrated by those who had in the past had the power to change things but did not.

Reporter describes him as ""part of the problem, not the solution"".

Dušan Keber, a former health minister, is ""yet another person who had held senior office in the past and squandered the chance to sort out the system.

""All that has remained of [his] reforms is dead ink on paper, only the balance on Keber's bank account was significantly higher. When people remind him of that now, he is deeply hurt, claiming these are ad personam attacks on him,"" according to Reporter.

Biometric ID cards start replacing health insurance cards,"Health insurance cards used in Slovenia will gradually become obsolete for those who have gotten a new, biometric, ID card after March 2022. Nevertheless, the ZZZS insurance institute is advising users to hold on to their health insurance cards, as transition will be gradual, starting on Monday.","All holders of the new ID card over the age of 12 will be able to use it instead of their health insurance card. Meanwhile, the ID cards held by younger children are not fitted with an electronic chip and are not intended for the use in healthcare.

Transition will be gradual, ZZZS said, saying that it will require some 2,000 healthcare providers to adapt their IT systems.

Health insurance cards will remain in use also after the transition is complete because IDs cannot be acquired by all healthcare users, including foreigners living in Slovenia.",health
Clinics for patients without named GP prove good stop-gap measure,"Clinics for patients without a named GP, which were introduced in January, have proved to be a good stop-gap measure to deal with the shortage of GPs. However, since patients need their own GP in the long term, systemic changes are needed, several community health centres which provide such services have told the STA.","The measure makes sense because many do not have a named GP, but they need their own GP in the long run, the Velenje Community Health Centre says. ""In case of a lack of staff, it is definitely sensible to keep such clinics.""

There are currently 24 such clinics across the country treating more than 12,000 patients, of which ten are in Ljubljana, treating almost 6,000 patients, Health Ministry data shows.

The ten clinics were being opened gradually due to a shortage of staff, and the the ministry rejected the city's proposal for more such offices and for allowing doctors from other towns and the self-employed to join the scheme.

There are two such clinics in Velenje for 2,660 patients, but although the city would need more, it cannot provide for another due to the shortage of staff.

Twelve more towns have one such clinic each, and there was also one in Kranj, but it closed in May as a new full-fledged GP clinic opened there.

There was great interest among Velenje staff to work in the temporary offices not only because of good pay but also because they wanted to help, yet the interest is waning.

Healthcare staff work in such clinics on a voluntary basis, with doctors receiving around EUR 80 net per hour and nurses around EUR 35.

""The staff are aware that such a work arrangement is not optimal, that it is important and safer for one and the same doctor treating their patient, rather than a different doctor every time,"" the Velenje Health Centre says.

The staff work at these offices besides their regular hours, which leads to exhaustion. ""In the long term, despite good pay, it seems that hardly anyone would persist as long as there is a need for such a clinic.""

Interest in Ljubljana was much lower yet most of the doctors from the city's community health centre work in them. In Maribor, two-third of the staff joined them, most of them working no more than two times a month.

Although patients are generally satisfied with the services, some are unhappy, because they have to describe their ailments every time they see a new doctor.

Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan believes the clinics have generally ""taken hold very well and are showing positive results"". He sees them as a model to address other pressing issues in the system, and says the ministry is considering reorganising and renaming them.

The clinics were introduced under the emergency law dealing with the consequences of the Covid pandemic, which was passed last October and is applicable between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2024.

Data from the public health insurance fund ZZZS shows that staff at the offices for patients without a named GP clocked just over 4,800 hours between January and April, costing it nearly EUR 1.15 million.",health
"Ministry presents strategy to improve access, quality of healthcare","The Health Ministry has presented a national strategy of quality and safety in healthcare for 2023-2031, which it adopted at the start of April as one of the steps towards equal access to medical services of comparable quality across Slovenia.","The strategy is based on the principles of quality, safety, accessibility, efficiency, equality, and focus on patients, Aleš Šabeder, head of the ministry's office for control, quality and investment in healthcare, said at Brdo pri Kranju on Tuesday.

The document pursues four goals: outcomes for individuals and the population, costs per individual and the population, patient experience, and staff satisfaction.

To improve the quality of services, the strategy pursues several goals, said Suzana Šuklar, head of the ministry's sector for quality and security.

She listed making the services more successful, focussing on the needs of patients, improving safety and efficiency of treatment, and providing equal and better access to treatment.

""With this strategy we will clearly get at our key and final goal, for each resident to get quality medical treatment regardless of where they live,"" said State Secretary Tadej Ostrc.

Based on the strategy, the ministry will draft an action plan to implement it and present both documents in parliament, he announced.

Šuklar said the ministry would also draft a bill on quality and safety in healthcare which should bring quality standards in line with international guidelines.

Moreover, the ministry is serious about patient complaints and thus plans to unify several surveys on patient experience this year, she added.

The ministry also plans to transform its office for control, quality and investment in healthcare to a national agency of quality control, said Šabeder, with Ostrc adding that Slovenia would be helped in this effort by Switzerland's agency of quality.

Joao Breda from the World Health Organization congratulated Slovenia on the new strategy, which he hailed as ""a step in the right direction"".

He said that Slovenia was a European country with one of the best healthcare systems, especially because of its good primary level and the staff's expertise.",health
NSi presents proposals to improve healthcare accessibility,"The opposition New Slovenia (NSi) has come up with a package of proposals to improve the accessibility of the public healthcare system. These include the engagement of all available capacities and the coverage of all medical services, including those by private providers, by the public health insurance.","The nine proposals to establish a better healthcare system were presented at a press conference on Wednesday by NSi president Matej Tonin, who said that Slovenia needed these solutions.

The party thinks that all available capacities of all providers of healthcare services - public institutions, concessionaires and private providers - need to be engaged immediately.

It is proposed that every qualified and licensed physician independently decides where and how they will practice their profession, and that a special status of an independent provider of healthcare services be introduced.

Every patient should independently decide where they will receive healthcare services, and it is key that they do not pay for the service, as this is covered by the public health insurance fund or their top-up health insurance.

The party would like to see what it sees as the monopoly of the ZZZS public health insurance fund be abolished. ""It is a socialist mastodon and solutions that may have been good 30 or 40 years ago are no longer appropriate today,"" Tonin said.

The NSi wants clear quality and safety standards for healthcare services be introduced, so that they are paid based on the results of treatment and professional standards, and that health workers are rewarded based on their results.

The proposals also include public healthcare institutions being transformed into non-profit companies, higher enrolment in medical schools, reduced administrative burden on doctors and true digitization of healthcare.

The NSi would like Slovenia to adopt the functioning healthcare concepts from Western Europe. ""If something can work in Austria, Switzerland or Germany, then I see no reason why these things should not also work in Slovenia,"" Tonin said.

If nothing happens by spring, the party will file relevant legislative proposals, and if the government proposes a reform of its own by then, the NSi will try to get their proposals implemented by filing amendments.",health
Limits placed on extra payments to cut hospital waiting times,The government has adopted legislation that places limits on payments to health providers under a scheme designed to cut hospital waiting times. Not all services will be covered this way and private providers will no longer be eligible.,"In July 2022 the Act on Emergency Measures to Ensure the Stability of Healthcare System was passed in order to cut waiting times. Extra payments for all services were provided and private practitioners were eligible if public providers could not perform the services.

It has since transpired that most of the money had been spent on less complex but more profitable services.

The amendments to the act, adopted at a correspondence session last night, limit these extra payments to a pre-determined set of services that will be confirmed by the government at the proposal of the ZZZS, the public health insurer.

Private providers, which could perform services under this law a a backup, if public providers could not, will no longer be eligible for these funds.

The measure is being transformed to specifically targeted health services where waiting times are longest and health benefits are highest,"" the government said.

When it was first announced last year, the legislation was billed as a ""stress test"" for the healthcare system designed to see how many services the system is capable of performing.

Data released by the government in April show that between October and December last year, public and private health providers performed extra services worth EUR 79 million.

More than a third of money, 36%, was spent by concessionaires and a quarter by both university medical centres in Ljubljana and Maribor. Other hospitals accounted for 22% of spending and community health centres for 19%.

Overall, public providers accounted for 64% of all spending and private providers with concessions for 36%.",health
Social workers under scrutiny after six-year-old tests positive for cocaine,"A six-year-old boy has been found with cocaine in his system after staying with his father in Piran. The father is now in custody while the social work centre in charge is under scrutiny for not heeding the mother's warnings that the father, who is a drug addict, is unfit to be a carer, TV Slovenija has reported.","The mother suspected something was amiss after her son returned from his father with a headache and feeling sick. She bought an at-home drug test, which showed the boy was positive for cocaine.

Repeat screening tests performed at the emergency unit of the community health centre and the Izola hospital were positive as well. The boy was also diagnosed with a heart murmur.

The boy was unable to tell his mother how the drug entered his system. The mother told TV Slovenija that her son had severe nose bleeds and frequent bouts of angina over the past six moths.

The 40-year-old father from Piran is in custody, facing charges of child neglect, brutal treatment and enabling the child to use illicit drugs.

If found guilty, he faces between one and 12 years in prison for drug possession and between one and three years for child neglect.",health
NLB launching Southeast Europe art collection,"Banking group NLB will start a new art collection called SEE ART to showcase contemporary artists from the region. The bank plans to invest EUR 100,000 annually to acquire works of art.","The new collection will be exhibited at a new gallery at Bankarium, the Slovenian Banking Museum, at NLB's premises in Čopova Street in Ljubljana, NLB officials told reporters on Wednesday.

The bank already keeps an art collection, having purchased and collected around 2,000 works in the past, a selection of which is exhibited at Bankarium.

However, the bank now wants to resume purchases of art.

They want to ""support mainly topical artists from the region in which NLB Group is present,"" NLB chairman Blaž Brodnjak said, making special mention of Croatia, where the bank is not present.

The SEE ART gallery will open in the autumn 2024, Irena Čuk, director of NLB cultural heritage, said. It will be designed by Scapelab, an architectural firm responsible for the renovation of Cukrarna.

By purchasing and showcasing works of art NLB would like to become a major supporter and partner of artists in Southeast Europe, curator Meta Kordiš said.

The project will be overseen by an international arts council comprising curators Tevž Logar as the chairman, Mira Gakjina from Skopje and Maja Kolarić from Belgrade.

Gakjina said of the name SEE ART defined the collection's geographical framework, but could also be interpreted in a broader sense.

The collection will include works by artists from the whole region, across all generations and media, from paintings to sculptures, video, installations, performances to digital media and new technologies.

To select the works, different methods will be applied, from open calls, to competitions and awards to exhibitions, Serbian curator Kolarič said.

According to Logar, the project will function as a platform for education and improvement of production conditions for artists in dialogue with research, publishing, residencies and institutional cooperation.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Music in focus of annual Palestine culture festival,The 12th annual Cultural Embassy of Palestine is opening later on Monday with a photo exhibition showcasing the story of Palestine through music. Palestinian music and the role it plays in preserving Palestinian culture and identity is the central theme of the annual festival.,"""Although images from Palestine often reach us, still most of us are not familiar with Palestinian music and its musicians, and yet it represents such a rich and creative landscape,"" the main organizer of the event, the Palestinian Rights Movement, said.

The exhibition My Flute is Palestinian seeks to pay tribute to the rich Palestinian musical tradition, spanning from folk music to songs of resistance and the contemporary experimental and innovative scene. Present at the gallery Fotogalerija for the opening will be Nidal Kalboneh, a musician from Nablus who currently lives in Poland.

An evening of music and talk at Pritličje Bar on Tuesday will see Palestinian musician Nidal Kalboneh talk about the stories behind the songs featured at the exhibition, and sign and play them.

The day after the Slovenian Cinematheque will screen the 2015 feature film Ya tayr el tayer (The Idol). Directed by Hany Abu Assad, the film was Palestine's candidate for the Oscar nomination.

It tells the true story of Mohammed Assaf, a young and talented wedding singer from Gaza who succeeds to audition for the Arab Idol and ultimately wins the competition, making proud the population of the world's biggest open-air prison.

Qais Attaallah, the actor cast in the role of the protagonist, will be discussing the film after the screening with film critic Petra Meterc.

The festival will wrap up on Thursday at the Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology of the University of Ljubljana with a talk and music session themed Lullabies: Melodies of Memories, Comfort and Dreams.

The event will see Palestinian musician Mahmud al Khatib from Jordan, Wafa Kaanan from Gaza and anthropologist Katarina Juvančič discuss how first melodies can make a mark and serve as a link.

The Cultural Embassy of Palestine is an annual festival designed to present the Palestinian culture and history and encourage a rethink about Palestine.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Open air New Year's celebrations drew tens of thousands of people,"Tens of thousands of people ushered in the New Year at open air celebrations in cities all across the country. The biggest celebration was held in Ljubljana, with concerts in four venues. Unseasonably warm weather drew not only locals, but also many tourists.","While many cities, including Ljubljana, still put on the fireworks, an increasing number are breaking with the tradition, among them Maribor, Celje, Koper and Novo Mesto.

In Maribor, the main venue at Leon Štukelj Square drew some 10,000 people, while many counted down the final seconds of 2022 at the top of the Pohorje ski slopes.

While celebrations were held in many other towns across the country as well, none were as big as those in Ljubljana and Maribor.

Street vendors who have been selling food and drink throughout December in Ljubljana are largely happy with the holiday season, even though it is far from the record-breaking end of 2019.

Viktorija, a vendor, told the STA that most of her customers were Italians, while Tomaž, another vendor, added that there were also many Austrians and Croatians.

While mulled wine remains an all-time favourite, hot gin is also becoming popular this year, Viktorija and Tomaž said.

Jaden from Singapore was among the tourists celebrating in Ljubljana. He told the STA that the city was very beautiful. He liked the open-air concerts and street musicians, as well as the atmosphere and the decorations.

Italian Eleonora usually celebrates New Year's in a restaurant close to her home, but this year her family decided to visit Ljubljana, which they find very beautiful.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Rog Centre ready to welcome Ljubljana's creatives,"The Rog Centre, a new arts and culture hub located in the revamped enormous central building of Ljubljana's former bicycle factory Rog, will open its doors this evening.","The new centre, which cost the city roughly EUR 25 million and comes after a series of aborted investment ideas, is meant to primarily address a lack of work spaces for creatives in the capital.

It will house nine production ""labs"" or co-production workshops, including carpentry, metalworking, ceramics, glass, cookery and textiles workshops, a 3D printing, laser cutting and electronics workshop, a jewellery and precious metals workshop and a green technology lab.

The workshops will be open to the professional as well as lay public for an annual membership fee of 15 euros, or 10 euros for students, those under 25 or over 65, the unemployed and asylum seekers.

Rog Centre furthermore accommodates 19 studios for artists and collectives from various artistic fields, along with with five residential studios reserved for foreign artists, as well as a library on 300 square metres of space.

There will also be a large area for socialising and exhibitions available, two restaurants, cafes and six shops, one of them selling products manufactured at the labs.

Rog Centre moreover plans to provide space and opportunities for schools and has already signed a partnership contract involving ten faculties. These are expected to have a classroom in the building for their interdisciplinary projects.

Meanwhile, the courtyard of the centre features the Park of the Erased, dedicated to the suffering of almost 25,700 people descending from other parts of the former Yugoslavia who were illegally removed from Slovenia's permanent residence registry in 1992.

The opening marks a major new chapter in the history of a central location in the capital that dates back to 1871. It all began with leather tanning facilities, which were nationalised in 1945 and converted for the purposes of the Rog factory about six years later.

The complex of the location's buildings, which spanned across about 7,000 square metres, was left to dilapidate after Rog terminated production in 1991. In 2006 the premises were squatted by activists and turned into a counterculture centre that was forcibly shut down by the city in 2021.

Attempting to capture some of this history but primarily the conversion of the complex in the past two years is an exhibition by photographers Branko Čeak and Jure Horvat, whose launch is part of the opening.

The opening is also expected to be marked by a protest gesture being organised by the members of the evicted autonomous community. The counterculture centre, albeit fraught with problems amid conditions without water or electricity, had housed several studios, a skate park, and centres helping immigrants and other marginalised groups, such as the erased.

The group claims that not creativity but profit, also involving a further gentrification of the surrounding area, will be the main driving force of the new centre. They say the new centre will accommodate creative elites as opposed to remedying the increasingly burning lack of workspace for Ljubljana's precarious creatives.","arts, culture and entertainment"

Govt council on ex-Yugoslav communities discusses potential abolishment of TV show,"The government council for ethnic communities from the former Yugoslavia discussed on Wednesday developments that could lead to a TV show for them being abolished, while also touching on state funds for the ethnic communities and on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the Culture Ministry said in a release.","Public broadcaster TV Slovenija launched the show NaGlas!, aired every other Saturday, eight years ago as the only such show for the Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian communities here.

In March, its editor and presenter Saša Banjanac Lubej said that the TV Slovenija acting director decided not to extend the contacts of the contributing journalists.

She said at the time that this would in effect mean cancelling the show although it is part of the national broadcaster's plan for this year.

The council members expressed concern over the announced termination of cooperation with the show's contributory, who are all members of the ex-Yugoslav communities.

They thus urged keeping the show's quality content, which they believe should not be impacted by the strained situation at public broadcaster RTV Slovenija.

The council will send its position to the government and urge RTV Slovenija to ensure conditions to keep NaGlas! within the current scope in the future.

Today's session was chaired by the council's head, Culture Minister Asta Vrečko, while ethnic Macedonian Ilija Dimitrievski was appointed vice-chair for this year.

The council also discussed the distribution of funds under the public call for cultural projects of ethnic communities and immigrants, which is the main source of the ex-Yugoslav communities' funding.

Vrečko announced that her ministry will provide an additional EUR 150,000 to the country's fund for cultural activities JSKD, to be available in two calls for proposals.

As for the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the council discussed recommendations regarding the council's activities and Slovenia's stance on them. The members agreed to ask the government to study the options for improving their status.

In December, The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson will be put on stage by Tomasz Spiewak and Michal Borczuch as the director. The project based on Nelson's autobiographical book about a relationship with a transgender person will be based on a research among atypical couples and families and activists fighting for their rights in Slovenia.

As part of a programme focusing on inclusion of the young into theatre and the public discourse, The Art of War/The Art of Peace by Ana Duša, inspired by the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war and the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War by Sunzi, will premiere in January 2024.

In March, different stereotypes and auto-stereotypes about Slovenia will be presented in a project by acclaimed German director Sebastian Nübling.

Boutique bookshop opening in Ljubljana,"LUD Literatura, a small Slovenian publisher, is opening a boutique bookshop in Ljubljana on Wednesday, transforming its editorial office into a space that sells books by small publishers and hosts literary events.","LUD Literatura is one of many boutique publishers in Slovenia, bringing out original poetry and prose, as well as Slovenian and translated essays, literary theory and philosophy works.

+MSUM opens exhibition on art collections,"The Museum of Contemporary Art (+MSUM) will open on Tuesday evening Exercises in a Collection, an exhibition that reflects on art collections and their exhibitions from a historical perspective to show that ways in which works of art are acquired and put on display are neither static nor permanent but depend on ideology.","The museum says on its website that collecting works of art is always tied to various cultural policies, which largely reflect the ideologies of a certain time.

It adds that colonialism made it possible for numerous Western museums to possess many (art) objects from (former) colonies, and it is only over the last few decades that the restitution of artworks to their places of origin has begun in earnest.

Museum in non-Western countries meanwhile approach the idea of collections and decolonisation by reflecting on how to juxtapose their local histories and specific artistic expressions with their Western counterparts.

One such example is the Arteast 2000+ collection, a pioneering international collection focussing from its inception in the late 1990s on the post-WWII Eastern European avant-gardes in the broader international context.

The collection was conceived at the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana by its then director Zdenka Badovinac, with the first exhibition of works from it being put on show at the former Yugoslav People's Army barracks building - which now houses +MSUM - in 2000 with the title The Art of Eastern Europe in Dialogue with the West.

Works from Arteast 2000+ are one of the three parts of the exhibition opening today, bringing sculptures from the 1990s by prominent international artists of the time.

These sculptures constitute the beginning of the collection and relate to the idea of an East European collection in dialogue with Western works, +MSUM says.

Another part of the show brings works acquired for Arteast 2000+ in recent years and works that indicate the direction in which the collection might evolve.

It features young and middle-generation artists from the region of former Yugoslavia that address the topic of the work of female artists, with an emphasis on (traditional) handicrafts.

The third part of the show focuses on the former Yugoslavia's cultural diplomacy, the exchange of artworks between Yugoslav republics and on donations of artworks.

A performance by Maja Smrekar and Ada von Eyachtal termed Delo in Dom (Work and Home) will accompany the opening of the display, curated by Bojana Piškur.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Culture Ministry dishes out EUR 2.9m in support of media content,The Culture Ministry has picked the beneficiaries of a total of EUR 2.9 million in funding for media content for 2023. In some segments there are significant changes compared to last year.,"The annual funding scheme aims to support media in the creation and dissemination of content relevant to the pursuit of public interest in accordance with the media act.

It is divided in two sections, one of which is meant to support pluralism and democracy of the general news print media, radio and television programming and electronic publications.

This year, EUR 846,000 was made available for this section, with none of the five outlets to receive the highest support this year being among the recipient of the call executed under the previous government.

The top recipients with EUR 40,000 each are the Pod Črto investigative journalism portal and the Večer daily paper. The former was ignored in the last two calls, while the latter is receiving much needed support among reports of lay-offs.

Other major publishers with revived noteworthy support include Delo, Dnevnik, Gorenjski, and the weekly paper Mladina, while some of the major recipients from last year were left empty-handed.

The highest recipient in the second section, supporting radio and television outlets with local, regional, student or non-profit status, was Radio Študent with almost EUR 99,000 in state funding. Following the progressive station, which was left without support last year, are several local radio stations with EUR 90,000 each.

Support was also slashed for some of last-year's top beneficiaries in this section, including the Catholic radio station Radio Ognjišče, which received EUR 100,000 last year, but all of them received around EUR 60,000.

The previous call, carried out under the previous, right-wing government, was heavily criticised because many recipients were seen as having very close links to the conservative government of the time or were overtly partisan, while outlets who had regularly received funds before were left empty-handed.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Pride Parade highlights need for continued fight,"The 23rd Ljubljana Pride Parade highlighted the continued need to fight for the rights of the LGBTIQ+ community as two incidents mired otherwise joyful festivities on Saturday
that organisers say attracted a crowd of 3,500.","The evening before Saturday's parade, unknown perpetrators broke a window with a rainbow flag in Pritličje, a popular venue right next to Town Hall that is owned by a prominent LGBTIQ+ rights activist.

""After the [2009] attack of neonazis on Cafe Open, after all the verbal and physical attacks on the LGBTIQ+ community, public instigation of hatred has materialised yet again. History repeats itself and continues,"" Pritličje said on Twitter.

And today, before the parade, a young woman draped in a rainbow flag was assaulted at Bavarski Dvor, a busy transport junction located on the route of the parade, which ran from Metelkova Mesto to Congress Square, several media have reported.

A minor altercation occurred at another point along the route of the parade as a group of young men and women held up a large banner saying ""There are only two genders,"" eliciting boos from the participants of the parade.

The slogan is similar to a campaign launched yesterday by the youth wing of the Democrats (SDS), the right-wing conservative party, under the slogan ""Two genders, one truth"" whose message is that there are only males and females.

The parade capped several weeks of festivities and activism under the slogan Multiple Communities, One Struggle, a slogan the organisers say embraces the diversity of the LGBTIQ+ movements, identities and struggles.

""The intertwining of our realities and interdependencies of diverse communities means that everyone is fighting one fight: for freedom, equality, dignity, a safe future, and an empowered community - for all and everywhere,"" they said.

They highlighted the need for solidarity in the face of racism, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, interphobia, violence and other forms of oppression which they say demands ""even more radical international solidarity.""

The same message was echoed in speeches at the end of the parade, which featured representatives of pride movements from Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ukraine.

President Nataša Pirc Musar became the first Slovenian head of state to address the parade, describing it in her keynote as more than just a colourful event and rainbow flags.

""It is an expression of the fight for human dignity. It is a protest with the clear message that every human being, regardless of their sexual orientation, sexual identity or sexual expression is worth of respect, love and equal treatment,"" she said.

She said the event was also an opportunity to promote change in society and a reminder that a lot of work remains to be done in order to ensure equality for everyone.

""Pride is a strong emotion that can initiate positive change. When people enter the streets with pride and confidence, they show others that acceptance is essential and that love is what makes us richer and better, good and noble. Love has no labels, no explanations. It is what is is, pure and simple. Love is the water of life,"" she said.

Several other senior officials attended the parade, among them Labour Minister Luka Mesec, and Minister for a Solidarity-Based Future Simon Maljevac, who is Slovenia's first openly gay member of government.","arts, culture and entertainment"

Carinthian Slovenians launch 30-day Slovenian language course,"Two umbrella cultural organisations of Slovenians in the Austrian province of Carinthia, which started a project called Experience Slovenian last year, have now launched a language course, mainly for the German-speaking Carinthians, called 30 Days - 30 Words.","Users can apply for the course launched by the Christian Cultural Association and the Slovenian Cultural Association at https://www.slovensko.at/30tage30woerter.

Conductor Karmina Šilec wins international award,"Conductor and composer Karmina Šilec is this year's recipient of the Darinka Matić Marović Prize. With her penchant for innovation, she has introduced a fresh approach to choral music and musical theatre and built her own style of artistic expression that knows no boundaries of cultures or nations, the jury said.","The prize is given every two years to a female artist originating from the Ex-Yu area whose works or achievements represent an outstanding contribution to the development of musical art in the region.

It was established in 2021 by KotorArt, a music festival in Montenegro, in honour of Matić Marović (1937-2020), an acclaimed Montenegro-born conductor and the first woman rector of the Belgrade University of Arts.

""Karmina Šilec's contribution to the development of musical art in our region is also a specific form of activity related to musical heritage and its implementation in contemporary creativity,"" the jury said, adding that the winner, who is active in many fields, constantly seeks new modes of expression.

Celebration of Culture Day in Cleveland prelude to Kurentovanje,"The largest Slovenian community in the US, in Cleveland, celebrated the upcoming Culture Day with musical performances on Sunday. The event was a prelude to Kurentovanje or the Slovenian Mardi Gras Festival, which will start on Saturday.","The event at St Mary of Assumption Church attracted a crowd of some 130 people and was attended by Slovenian Consul General in Cleveland Alenka Jerak.

Moderated by Joe Valencic and Luka Zibelnik, the event featured a concert by Martin Marsic, Tony Hocevar and John Nemec. Gaja Višnar recited Water Man in Slovenian and English, a famous poem by Slovenian bard France Prešeren (1800-1849), and Isabelle Kralj and Mark Anderson of Theatre Gigante from Milwaukee recited poems by Srečko Kosovel (1904-1926) in both languages.

Edo Ferrazzoli and Martin Marsic performed Johann Strauss's Tritsch-Tratsch polka, professor Timothy Pogacar read excerpts from The Visoko Chronicle by Ivan Tavčar (1851-1923), a Slovenian writer, lawyer and politician, and a group of children performed Slovenian folk songs.

Culture Day is celebrated in Slovenia on 8 February, which coincides with the anniversary of Prešeren's death.

As is tradition in Cleveland the Culture Day ceremony is held as a prelude to Kurentovanje, which has been organised in Cleveland since 2013. Starting on 11 February, the Slovenian Mardi Gras Festival will end with a big parade on 18 February. Kurenti, Slovenia's traditional carnival figures, will also make an appearance.

Kurentovanje will feature ten events, including presentations of Slovenian national costumes and beekeeping, wine tastings, concerts and a screening of the latest documentary by director Boris Petković, which is dedicated to the history of the Slovenian LGBT movement.

The festival is organised by the Slovenian Museum and Archives in cooperation with the Consulate General and other partners. This year's iteration will feature live and online events. Before Covid, the number of visitors went up to nearly 10,000.","arts, culture and entertainment"
Otto Tolnai wins Vilenica Prize,"Otto Tolnai, a Hungarian author from the Serbian province of Vojvodina, is the winner of the 2023 Vilenica Prize for Central European literature, to be presented at the conclusion of the international literary festival that goes by the same name in September.","A poet, writer, playwright, essayist and translator, Tolnai is considered one of the most important contemporary Hungarian writers.

A member of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Vojvodina, he studied Hungarian language and literature and philosophy in Novi Sad and Zagreb. He published his first poetry collection Homoru Versek (Hollow Verse) in 1963.

The prize jury praised his literature for being imbued ""with an openness, the sovereign freedom of moving between countries, landscapes, cultures and traditions"".

""The power of his texts is best manifested in the tiny scratches and cracks, into which the rich experience of the Hungarian intellectual heritage and of the ex-Yugoslav culture and reality freely penetrates,"" reads the justification.

Tolnai's poetics are rooted in the traditions of Hungarian culture and strongly influenced by modern Yugoslav literary trends, which makes them cross-cultural in nature. ""Underlying his life's art is a deep hedonism of his 'own' culture,"" the jury said.

The 38th Vilenica Festival will run between 4 and 9 September under the slogan The Diverse Face of Europe. The Slovenian author in focus will be poet Barbara Korun.

Tolnai will receive the prize at the conclusion of the festival, at a ceremony in the cave that gave the festival and the award its name.

Previous laureates include Milan Kundera, Peter Handke, Olga Tokarczuk, Ilma Rakusa, Austrian writer Josef Winkler, and Latvian poet Amanda Aizpuriete.

This year's winner was declared at Wednesday's press conference in Ljubljana by the Slovenian Writers' Association.","arts, culture and entertainment"
New generation takes over at Lotrič Metrology,"A new generation has taken up the reins at Lotrič Metrology, a family-run business that has grown into an international group. Having been elected president of the upper chamber of parliament, the company's founder Marko Lotrič handed over to his youngest daughter Maja Brelih Lotrič, who is determined to keep the company on the path of success.","Marko Lotrič started a business for the calibration of scales, weights and pipettes 32 years ago. Today, Lotrič Metrology employs more than 180 people in nine companies in seven countries, the founder told a press conference in Železniki, a town in north-western Slovenia where the company is based.

The company posted a stable 11% growth in revenue with the profit estimated to have increased at roughly the same rate. The parent company Lotrič Meroslovje generated EUR 6.8 million in sales revenue and the whole group EUR 10.5 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were close to one million euro, Lotrič said.

The company has not yet adapted the prices of its services to last year's inflation. ""We're making a lot of effort to find a right balance between inflation, our prices and the market situation,"" Lotrič said, adding that last year's growth was largely the result of volume growth.

The company performed almost 120,000 metrology testing checks last year. Their market share in Slovenia is estimated to be nearly 44%. ""This makes us the leading provider of metrological solutions,"" said Lotrič.

Their references include more than 20,000 companies and their certificates are present in more than 50 other countries. Last year they also made it to the Saudi Arabian market.

The company had been preparing for succession for years. Lotrič notified his co-workers seven years ago that he was going to retire from executive positions at the age of 60 and 40 years of service. A year later all family members signed an agreement setting out the values, guidance, commitments and decision-making processes in the company.

Considering the long preparations, there was no major shock when Lotrič was elected president of the National Council in December 2022. Wednesday marked the end of a month-long period of transition during which Lotrič retired from all positions in the company to focus fully on his work at the National Council.

Maja Brelih Lotrič took over as CEO of the parent company on 1 January. Her father has taught her how to recognise and grasp new opportunities and the importance of linking up. ""I will continue in the same direction in the future, in particular in foreign markets,"" Brelih Lotrič said.

She is not afraid of partnering up with multinationals because she believes in the expertise and the digital tools that their company has developed and which she said made them one of Europe's leading laboratories in the field.

""I'm aware of having taken over a stable company that grows by the year both in terms of finances and staff numbers ... I would like to bring logistic points closer to out clients and invest in new and existing services,"" the new CEO said. She indicated the company will try a shorter work week.

The generational transition in the company also included Lotrič's older daughter Katja Lotrič Kejžar and his son Mitja Lotrič taking over executive positions at subsidiaries. One major new project is in enhanced cooperation with Volkswagen for which Lotrič Metrology will test materials and components.","economy, business and finance"
"Logistics, IT and agriculture in focus of Slovenia-Vietnam cooperation talks","Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien started a two-day working visit to Slovenia on Monday by participating in a session of the Slovenian-Vietnamese intergovernmental commission for economic cooperation. The event focused above all on logistics, IT, tourism and agriculture, Slovenia's Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said.","The event was co-chaired by Dien and Fajon, who sees the session as a follow-up to her visit to Vietnam in May. Talking to the press at Brdo pri Kranju, she said the commission focused above all on logistics, IT, tourism and agriculture.

""Many opportunities for cooperation between our nations are emerging. Above all, our sea port, Luka Koper, is of great interest to southeast Asia, to Vietnam,"" said Fajon, adding that Luka Koper has such a strategic location that it allows business optimisation and represents the shortest route to Europe for Vietnamese companies.

Dien thanked Slovenia for a warm reception and said that there were many opportunities in cooperation, as well as challenges. Vietnam hopes that an investment protection agreement with the EU will be ratified soon and that a free-trade agreement with the EU will soon be implemented, Dien said.

Fajon meanwhile thanked Vietnamese business representatives for recognising business opportunities in Slovenia. ""I'm very happy that relations between our countries are strengthening and that we are nurturing regular dialogue about efforts to strengthen mutual cooperation.""

This afternoon, business representatives from Slovenia and Vietnam will be attending an event organised by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS), while tomorrow, the Vietnamese delegation will visit port operator Luka Koper.

The ministry said in a press release before the visit that relations between Slovenia and Vietnam were very good and that Vietnam was one of the most promising gateways to southeast Asia for the EU's industry.","economy, business and finance"
Finnair relaunches Ljubljana-Helsinki route after three years,"The Finnish air carrier Finnair started flying between Helsinki and Ljubljana on Monday, reestablishing a regular route between the two capitals after a three-year hiatus. It will be flaying back and fourth four times a week, Ljubljana airport operator Fraport Slovenija said in a press release.","Finnair will be flying to Helsinki on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Passengers will be able to transfer at Helsinki Vantaa airport to a number of Asia-bound flights.

Babett Stapel, the managing director of Fraport Slovenija, was quoted saying in the press release that the route will be a ""bridge for the arrival of Asian tourists to Slovenia"".

She also said that air traffic had been recovering nicely in the first three months of the year and would be getting even better with every coming week.","economy, business and finance"
"D&B analysis: Slovenian economy stable, but risks remain","An analysis by Dun & Bradstreet shows that the Slovenian economy has a stable foundation due to investments in own assets, as companies generated income more easily due to lower debt during the Covid-19 crisis, but risks remain. It was also noted that last year's revenue of Slovenian companies reached the highest amount since the euro adoption.","According to the analytics company, the total revenue generated by Slovenian companies increased steeply between 2014 and 2022, from EUR 79.4 billion to almost EUR 147 billion.

Last year's revenue increased by 23.3% compared to 2021, reaching the highest value since the euro adoption in 2007.

As a result, exports and profits increased last year, by 26.2% and 7.2%, respectively, and the net profit reached the highest nominal value since 2008, standing at EUR 6.5 billion.

The most of the net profit was posted by companies in manufacturing (EUR 2.3 billion) and in commerce and maintenance and repair of motor vehicles (EUR 1.2 billion).

Corporate debt decreased nominally from 2014 to 2022, but was 13% higher in 2022 than in the year before, with the reason being an above-average growth in short-term operating liabilities due to a 27.8% increase in the cost of goods, materials and services.

Dun & Bradstreet notes that prudence in the coming period was welcome, as major short-term borrowing can be expected, mainly from companies in groups or suppliers due to the growing trend of short-term operating liabilities.

Another reason for caution is the poorer payment discipline of Slovenia's economic partners, such as Germany and Switzerland. This is a signal for changes in payment policies or retention of short-term liquidity assets.

Dun & Bradstreet adds that the third reason for caution is the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy deteriorating last year compared to 2021 due to the slower growth of operating revenue compared to operating expenses.","economy, business and finance"

Govt adopts changes to register of companies,"The government has adopted changes to the law on the register of companies to bring it in line with two EU directives to further facilitate online incorporation of companies and of foreign subsidiaries, and to digitalise the process in which a company must send its new data to the court at which it is registered.","The bill transposes the digitalisation and mobility directives, the Justice Ministry said after the government's session on Thursday.

Under the new legislation, a company or a subsidiary of a foreign company could be incorporated and entered into the register of companies online.

This means that clients will not have to go in-person to the notary's office to register a single-member limited liability company nor to the SPOT point for business support.

For other types of companies, the notary will still have to be included in the incorporation process.

However, a company could be registered with the documents compiled or confirmed by a notary in a safe video link with the client.

The Slovenian Notary Chamber will set up and manage the IT system enabling safe video conferences with the option of video electronic IDing.

The same online procedure will apply to companies to get entered into the register of companies and to foreign companies in Slovenian to register their subsidiary.

The second major change is clients no longer having to notify courts where companies are registered about changes because business registers will now be integrated.

This means that subsidiaries of companies headquartered in other EU countries will no longer have to notify Slovenian courts of some of the changes regarding the companies in the original country.

The ministry said that the changes also bring more data transparency and accuracy, while expanding the range of documents and data to be exchanged between EU countries through integrated business registers and the range of data about physical persons that are kept in the register of companies.

Procedures will also be sped up, including the cross-border exchange of notifications, information and documents.

""To transpose the digitalisation and mobility directives, the existing IT systems will have to be upgraded"", which should cost around EUR 1 million, the ministry said.

The upgrade for the Slovenian Business Register is estimated at EUR 540,000 and that for the support system for companies at EUR 500,000.","economy, business and finance"
Finance rejects Canada's solution to real estate market crisis,The newspaper Finance rejects as misguided in Thursday's commentary the decisions of Canada and New Zealand to ban foreigners from their real estate markets to tackle the rising prices.,"Canada's real estate market is considered one of the costliest and least accessible in the world, as the ratio between the average value of an apartment and the net annual wage exceeds 11. Led by left-leaning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Canada has come up with a solution this year.

In a bid to stabilise the real estate prices, the country decided to ban sale of real estate to foreigners for two years. The only exception to this rule are foreign students, asylum seekers and people holding temporarily work permits.

In Ontario and British Columbia, foreigners own less than 6% of real estate. Canada has banned the purchase of apartments to foreigners who might set up or buy a company in Canada, transfer ideas, technologies, money there, create jobs, the paper says.

New Zealand introduced the same measure in 2018 when the ""much praised and ambitious Labour Party member Jacinda Ardern, who has since lost her stamina,"" was prime minister.

The measure has not brought the desired results. The purchase of real estate was a solution to fight inflation, while the prices went up of course, Finance says.

Given that the ratio between the value of an apartment and the net wage is more than ten in Ljubljana and almost nine in the whole country, similarly awful moves could be expected in Slovenia. The circumstances are just right.

A big systemic danger for the prosperity of the people is created when measures are not being judged by results, by whether they contribute to the prosperity but by ideology, warns the paper in the commentary Awful Political Decisions.","economy, business and finance"
MOL to sell 39 service stations to Shell as part of takeover of OMV Slovenija (adds),"MOL, the Hungarian oil company, plans to sell 39 service stations in Slovenia to British oil major Shell in a bid to receive clearance for the takeover of OMV Slovenija, the country's second largest chain of service stations.","The transaction involves some existing MOL service stations and some OMV service stations, the company said on Tuesday, describing it as ""a milestone in the process of securing European Commission clearance for the announced takeover of OMV Slovenija.""

""We are convinced that the acquisition of the OMV network will strengthen competition on the Slovenian market,"" Robert Pitt, the director of retail at MOL Group, was quoted as saying in the company's press release.

""MOL Group is one of the leading independent providers of oil derivatives on the regional market because it successfully manages the entire logistics chain.

""This allows us to preserve independent price competitiveness and will have a positive impact on reliability of supply of a large number of Slovenian consumers,"" he said.

MOL signed a EUR 301 million contract to increase its share in OMV Slovenija by 92.25% in 2021, when it already had a 7.75% stake in the company.

The announcement immediately raised concern about market concentration since it would create a near duopoly in Slovenia with petrol as the leader and MOL as runner-up, the EU Commission having found in a preliminary investigation that the transaction could severely undermine competition on the retail market.

OMV Slovenija owns 120 service stations and is the second largest gas station operator in the country after Petrol, which operates 318 stations. The owner of 53 gas stations, MOL is currently the third biggest operator.

Shell currently has one service station in Slovenia and eight automated service stations for lorries. The transaction would make it the third largest player on the Slovenian retail market.

The company said in a press release that the acquisition was ""an important step forward for the Shell brand in Slovenia, and provides better choice for customers since it improves market competition.""

It said the details of the deal would be announced after EU Commission clearance, but noted that it would turn the service stations into ""mobility centres"".","economy, business and finance"
Two airlines bid for subsidies,"Two airlines, one from Luxembourg and one from Montenegro, have applied for subsidies offered by the Slovenian government to improve the country's air connectivity in response to the first call.","Luxair and To Montenegro submitted their bids by the deadline that expired last week, the Infrastructure Ministry said on Monday.

The final decision on whether the bidders are eligible for the subsidies will be announced after the bids have been reviewed by a commission of the ministries of infrastructure, finance and the economy.

To Montenegro, the Montenegrin flag carrier which is branded as Air Montenegro, has a new CEO, Slovenian Mark Anžur, who was appointed to the post by the Montenegrin government on Thursday.

Anžur served as CEO of Slovenia's flag carrier Adria Airways from December 2012 to March 2016. Adria Airways went into receivership in 2019.

Under the scheme to improve Slovenia's air connectivity, two more calls are to be published this year, one in July and one in November, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.

The government has earmarked EUR 5.6 million a year for the next three years, or a total of EUR 16.8 million for the scheme.

Carriers can apply to get subsidies for new passenger air links covering 50% of airport fees at Slovenia's three international airports, Ljubljana, Maribor and Portorož.

The eligible carriers will receive subsidies based on three-month reports on the flights operated and the number of passengers carried.

The scheme prioritises ten destinations: Brussels, Skopje, Prague, Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen, Athens, Madrid, Amsterdam and Helsinki.

If any funds remain available after the first round, subsidies will be available to carriers flying to Rome, Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Lisbon, Prishtina and Paris.

If funds are still left to spend after the second round, subsidies will be made available for routes across the European Common Aviation Area, which includes the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo.","economy, business and finance"
Golob calls for enhanced dialogue with China as major partner,"Arriving for the second day of the EU summit in Brussels on Friday, Prime Minister Robert Golob called for dialogue with China to be enhanced, with the EU acting as independently as possible. He announced that he and his EU counterparts would try to agree on a unified policy towards China as a major partner.","""We are convinced that China is such an important superpower, also in the economic sense, that we must have an active dialogue with it. Slovenia will strive to enhance this dialogue both on the bilateral and multilateral levels,"" Golob said.

As part of this dialogue, the EU must find its place and try to act as independently as possible, he said as he arrived for the second day of the summit, where the EU leaders are also scheduled to discuss the relations with China.

Golob and his counterparts from other EU member states will try to agree on a unified trade policy towards China, which the Slovenian prime minister described as a very important foreign trade partner of the EU.

He expects several proposals on the table today and that some countries will again try to ""do a solo act"", while he does not expect that interventions will be made in the proposed resolutions on China.

According to the draft resolutions, the EU leaders are expected to commit to mitigating risks in the trade and economic relations with China.

They are also expected to note the importance of continued cooperation in dealing with global challenges such as climate change. The leaders should also call on Beijing to put pressure on Moscow to stop its aggression against Ukraine.

The summit is expected to end with a discussion on foreign affairs, including the latest escalation of tensions in the north of Kosovo after the April local elections. A call for the tensions to calm down and elections to be repeated is expected.

The second day started with a discussion on migration, after the EU leaders could not agree on the content of relevant resolutions on the first day. Golob said that European Council President Charles Michel would only prepare minutes on the topic.

The EU leaders did agree on how to manage migration outside the borders of the EU, the Slovenian prime minister added.","economy, business and finance"
Govt adopts bill to boost air connectivity with new subsidies,"The government adopted on Thursday a bill envisaging EUR 5.6 million in state aid to secure better air connectivity, which Infrastructure Ministry State Secretary Alenka Bratušek said experienced substantial decline in the past two years. The aid scheme remains to be approved by the European Commission.","The move comes after the state already provided air connectivity schemes involving subsidies for airlines in 2021 and 2022. Bratušek, scheduled to become minister, spoke during her confirmation meeting earlier in the day of an emergency bill that would enable the subsidising of passengers as opposed to airlines.

The legislation was drawn up jointly by the Economy Ministry and the Infrastructure Ministry, which Bratušek said would also determine together a list of destinations to be included in the scheme on the basis of their significance for Slovenia.

""Our financial estimate is EUR 5.6 million per year, based on the assumption that we will secure ten daily connections for about 255 days of the year,"" Bratušek told the press after the government's session. She added the estimate was also based on the assumption that there would be between 120 and 130 passengers on board.

Given that the scheme constitutes state aid, an approval is needed from the European Commission. ""We have already forwarded the bill to it. We are acting fast because we want to get there before the summer season, which already starts at the end of March,"" Bratušek added.

Economy Minister Matjaž Han agreed the bill was important. ""We have secured a source of funding for air links in Slovenia for a period of three years,"" he said.

Better connectivity is vital for Slovenia to be well integrated into global currents, Han said. ""Slovenia is an export-oriented economy, we have quality tourism and therefore we need good air connections,"" he added.","economy, business and finance"
"Debate hears UK still open for business, trade on the rise","A business event was held in Kranjska Gora on Thursday to discuss the issues raised by Brexit, with the organisers noting that the UK is still open for business, and that trade between and the UK and the EU is continually on the rise.","The event was hosted by the British-Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and the Spirit Slovenia investment promotion agency to present business in the UK market and to discuss how to successfully enter it after Brexit.

The organisers noted that the UK is still open for business, and that companies are convinced to export or invest in the UK by the openness to innovation, possibility to achieve premium prices, the 66-million market, connections with the rest of the world and a reliable business environment.

""The UK is a country of great opportunities, but it is a large and discerning market, so the help of reliable partners in entering it is very valuable,"" said acting director of Spirit Slovenia Rok Capl.

Capl noted the activities of the agency in this field and the cooperation with the British-Slovenian Chamber of Commerce in organising various events to strengthen cooperation between the companies of the two countries.

He said that as many as 800 Slovenian companies were exporting to the UK and that there were more than 330 companies with British capital in Slovenia.

British Ambassador Tiffany Sadler said the goal was to further strengthen bilateral economic cooperation and that she was happy that business was booming and that bilateral trade in 2021 was the highest ever.

The ambassador noted that there were many British companies that had successfully invested in Slovenia, and vice versa, which both countries could build on, adding that many Slovenian companies relied on British products in their supply chains.

One of such companies is the sports equipment maker Elan, which Ambassador Sadler and His Majesty's Trade Commissioner for Europe Chris Barton will visit today.

Sadler said that there was still a lot of potential for business cooperation in various fields, and urged Slovenian entrepreneurs to think of the UK when investing or when looking for resources for their business.

Barton added that while the last three years had been a major challenge for the UK due to Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, business with the EU member states was growing again.

The numbers are exceptional and this is a solid basis for further growth, said Barton, who is happy about Slovenian exports to the UK having increased by as much as 40% recently.

The trade commissioner would also like to see more investments from Slovenia, especially in technology, as he promotes the British market as an excellent springboard for other markets, as the business environment is stable, and the workforce good.","economy, business and finance"

Finance wonders who is allowed to profit,"After the news that Italy was instating a windfall tax on banks, Slovenia was quick to respond but without limiting itself to only banks, Finance writes in Thursday's commentary titled Who is Allowed to Have a Profit?","Commenting on companies operating with enormous profit, Prime Minister Robert Golob said he strongly believes and expects that ""a large part of that will be given in solidarity, in one way or another"".

As for potential debt cancellation for those affected by floods, Golob said this was up to bankers, adding that the ""solidarity we expect from them can come in different ways"". ""But we expect it and we expect a lot of it,"" he added.

What is enormous profit? And what is a lot of solidarity? Who will decide that? And is having a profit a bad thing? Such statements are political lunacy, Finance writes, adding that it should not be more acceptable that the Italian or any other government is doing the same.

No one feels bad for banks and they do not deserve pity, Finance writes. Still, banks must be motivated to make profit, which brings investments, growth, higher wages.

People too are motivated to make profit and the state should not come to collect their profit, even if it is ""enormous"" in Golob's eyes.

With the rising demand for construction work in flood relief, the prices of these services will grow and maybe their profits as well. ""Will we be allowed to rebuild Slovenia or will builders have to give away their profits?"" Finance wonders.","economy, business and finance"
Third call published for airline subsidies,New subsidies for airlines wishing to fly to Slovenia are available under a third call for tenders published by the Infrastructure Ministry on Friday.,"EUR 5.6 million is available per year between 2023 and 2025. Applications are due within 30 days, according to the notice published in the Official Gazette and the EU's Official Journal.

The subsidies cover 50% of airport fees at Slovenia's three international airports in Ljubljana, Maribor and Portorož for flights to and from airports in the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA).

Two airlines have received funding in the previous two rounds of financing.

Luxair has already launched flights to Luxembourg, whereas Air Baltic is expected to start operating flights to Riga, the capital of Latvia, in spring.","economy, business and finance"
Court-mandated restructuring for paper mill Vipap Videm completed,"Court-mandated restructuring has been completed at Vipap Videm Krško, Slovenia's largest paper producer, two year after the launch of the process in which Kompas Shop has emerged as the majority owner of what was a Czech-owned company for several years. Vipap needs to repay creditors by the end of 2027.","Vipap Videm was owned by the Czech companies Vipap Holding and Vipap CZ until late last year, when a debt-to-equity conversion was approved as part of court-mandated debt restructuring that led to significant changes in ownership.

The Krško District Court, which on Monday announced the end of proceedings that involved creditors with a total of EUR 27.6 million of ordinary claims and EUR 15.5 million of secured claims.

The owners of the former are meant to be repaid 15% of their claims by 2026, while the secured claims holders will be paid 15% of the principal by Vipap Videm in the years 2023 to 2026, and then the final 40% by the end of 2027.

The new majority owner of the company, which presently has 260 workers, is Kompas Shop. Owned by entrepreneur Aleksander Jereb, the former operator of what used to be duty-free shops at Slovenia's border crossings received regulatory approval for a takeover in December last year.

While Kompas Shop and affiliated Astra Invest hold a 54% stake together, another major owner is the utility company Kostak.

Both Kostak and Kompas Shop told the business paper Finance in December their objective was to preserve the paper production. But there have been speculations that a logistics hub and an incinerator were also planned.","economy, business and finance"
Food delivery couriers stage two-hour work stoppage (adds),"The Trade Union of Food Delivery Couriers staged a two-hour work stoppage Friday after delivery companies Wolt and Glovo refused to recognise the union or enter talks on a collective bargaining agreement. More than 100 couriers stopped working between 11am and 1pm, the union said, while Wolt and Glovo said the strike did not affect work.","Since ""the companies refuse to reveal information on the number of couriers"", it is impossible to determine the share of Wolt and Glovo couriers on strike compared to the total number of them, said Mojca Žerak from the youth trade union Mladi Plus, under whose auspices the couriers' union was formed in mid-April.

On 26 April, the Trade Union of Food Delivery Couriers presented Wolt and Glovo, the only two app-based food delivery services in the country, with a request to enter negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement that would regulate the status of couriers.

Wolt and Glovo rejected the request on the grounds that there was no legal basis either for the negotiations due to the couriers' freelance status or for couriers unionising.

The union argues this is not true, as ""workers' unionising is a basic human right enshrined in the constitution in Slovenia"", and one of trade unions' primary tasks is collective bargaining agreements.

The union sees the companies' response as a clear attack on unionising, and it intends to fight iz with all the means at its disposal.

The first step was today's strike, during which the participating couriers refrained from working, but it was up to them whether they remained logged in in the Glovo or Wolt app.

One of the union's members told a press conference in Ljubljana that the union would like to see systemic solutions and negotiations.

""If couriers were happy, they would not strike. Our situation has worsened, we earn 20-30% less because of the change in the pay system, while the cost of living is rising,"" he said, with the press release stating only his first name.

Mladi Plus's Jernej Kastelic said that there was a single strike demand - for Wolt and Glovo to enter the negotiations. ""If the demand is not met, we will step up industrial action.""

Mladi Plus is a legitimate and representative trade union, and the number of its members constitutes the legal basis for entering the negotiations, Žerak pointed out.

""We are the only trade union representing couriers, and there is more than 120 couriers already affiliated with the union. This means we meet the statutory conditions for being considered representative,"" she said as she dismissed the companies' claims that the self-employed could not be members of a union.

""The right to this is regulated at European level,"" she said, adding that in many European countries there were collective agreements between platform companies and couriers.

In addition to many Slovenian trade unions and organisations, the European Trade Union Confederation has also expressed support for the couriers' union, calling on the companies to enter the negotiations and ensure decent working conditions, Kastelic said.

The organisation has also vowed to inform those responsible at the EU level of this case of disrespect for basic European values, he added.

The union's representatives met European Commission representatives in Brussels on Thursday to draw attention to the situation of couriers in Slovenia.

""The European Commission agrees that platform work needs to be regulated, and has drawn up a proposal for a European directive,"" Kastelic said.

The strike seems not to have affected Wolt and Glovo much; Wolt said that only around 10 of their delivery couriers went on strike and that it was an ordinary rainy Friday. Glovo does not have the information about the number of couriers on strike, ""but we made sure there were no major delivery disruptions"".

Wolt denied having raised the hourly pay for the duration of the strike by 80%, explaining factors such as weather are taken into account in setting the hourly rate.

Both companies said they were willing to continue dialogue with the delivery couriers.

Wolt said it had last met Mladi Plus in mid-March. ""We told them we support the European Commission's activities at local and EU levels to provide guidelines for members states that would pay the way to collective representation for the self-employed."" It intends to continue the dialogue at individual and group levels.

Glovo said it had acted in good faith and carefully assessed the demands of the ""association"" of the self-employed at Mladi Plus from the legal point of view. ""We would like to stress that we are always open to dialogue, to understanding needs and to seeking constructive solutions to all issues"".",labour
"Petrol, diesel slightly costlier from Tuesday","The prices of petrol sold outside the motorway network will increase by tree cents a litre on Tuesday morning, diesel fuel will go up by 0.6 cents and heating oil by one cent, the Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy said on Monday.","Until 19 June, the price of regular petrol will be EUR 1.412 per litre and diesel will be sold at EUR 1.432 per litre. Heating oil, whose retail price is regulated at all points of sale, including along the motorways, will cost EUR 1.02 per litre.

While the prices of fuels sold along the motorways are not regulated, the prices of fuels sold outside the motorway system are calculated every fortnight based on the trend of oil derivative prices on the global market and the ratio between the US dollar and the euro.

HAd the prices not been regulated and the government had not suspended several taxes, regular petrol would cost EUR 1.416 a litre, the ministry said, which means consumers will save up EUR 2.45 per a 50-litre tank. A litre of diesel without price regulation and suspension of taxes would cost EUR 1.483, saving consumers EUR 2.55 per a 50-litre tank.

As for heating oil, the price without regulation and tax suspension would be set at EUR 1.118, calculations by the ministry show. With the regulation, consumers save EUR 98 per 1,000 litres.

Traders' margins are capped at EUR 0.0983 per litre for diesel, at EUR 0.0994 per litre for regular petrol, and EUR 0.08 per litre for heating oil, in accordance with the government decree.

Petrol and diesel prices are fully liberalised on motorways and expressways.",labour
"Companies to pay 0.8% of profits, people 0.3% of income tax to flood fund (adds)","After the government adopted an emergency flood relief bill on Thursday, Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič explained on the late-night current affairs show Odmevi that contributions to a special reconstruction fund would amount to 0.8% of pre-tax profit for companies and to 0.3% of income tax for individuals.","Individuals whose base for the solidarity contribution does not exceed 35% of the average pay in the country in 2023 and 2024 will not have to pay the contribution to the Slovenian Reconstruction Fund.

Boštjančič, noting damage from the floods was estimated at over EUR 5 billion, said that these contributions are to net EUR 100 to 150 million a year for the fund.

Instead of paying the mandatory contribution, people will also be able to work it off - by working one Saturday this year and another in 2024.

However, the solidarity contribution will be reduced by the contribution the worker or the employer will pay to the fund from the money made on the solidarity Saturday.

Depending on how work process is organised at individual companies, any other work day could serve as a solidarity day.

Employers will have to notify the Financial Administration about it in advance, while a written consent by workers will be needed before the employer sends their one-day pay to the solidarity fund.

The employers will calculate the contribution of workers and of the employer on their own in line with the legislation.

The employer's contribution will not count as a deduction for donations or an expense under corporate income tax and personal income tax laws.

Boštjančič told TV Slovenija last evening that the financial effects of the emergency legislation adopted yesterday were assessed at between EUR 150 and 170 million.

Details about the fund, whose acronym is SOS, are not yet entirely clear, but unofficial information by several media indicates that it would manage around EUR 3 billion.

"Pensioner rally calls for ""preserving RTV's plurality""","The fifth rally of pensioners was held in Ljubljana's city centre on Wednesday with protesters demanding higher pensions and calling for ""plurality to be preserved at the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija"". Some RTV journalists said protesters threatened them in front of RTV building.","The rally, organised by the initiative Voice of Pensioners and its offshoot 1 October Institute led by Pavel Rupar, was mainly held in Republic Square and in front of the parliament building, but a part of protesters first gathered in front of RTV.

Several journalists said that the protesters had obstructed the building's entrance and that they had been subject to insults and threats when entering or exiting the building, which they reported to police.

Rupar thanked in his speech in Republic Square to those RTV staff who he said had been enabling pluralism at the broadcaster recently. He expressed hope this pluralism would continue also after the changes to the RTV law enter into force in line with the most recent decision by the Constitutional Court.

He urged pensioners not to pay the RTV subscription fee for at least three months if it does not.

Turning to the pensioners' financial situation, Rupar said most of them could not make ends meet. He was also critical of the announced government measures for pensioners worth EUR 100 million.

He said the prime minister, president and the National Assembly president had been invited to the rally but they did not turn up, ""because they cannot show anything that they have done for pensioners"".

Along with flags the protesters also carried banners, with one of them saying that Golob was living the high life and was not concerned about pensioners, farmers and workers.

The Voice of Pensioners started collecting signatures in April for a bill that would raise the monthly pensions which are lower than EUR 1,000 by 20%, those up to EUR 1,500 by 10% and those over EUR 1,500 by 5% until a new pension reform is passed.

Employers urge deferral of changes involving posted workers,Business organisations have urged Labour Minister Luka Mesec to extend the transitional period for implementing legislative changes entailing increased costs for employers when posting employees abroad for at least one year. They are also angry that the government found a solution that would not lower diplomats' pay.,"In late March, the National Assembly approved a new law on cross-border provision of services, which removed a provision in the law on pension and disability insurance that previously allowed employers to lower the tax base for paying contributions for certain posted workers to the legal minimum.

The law has entered into force, with the exception of the abolition of the provision, which will take effect on 1 January 2024 under an agreement on the Economic and Social Council.

During this transitional period, the Finance Ministry is due to examine possible solutions to ensure that the burden on companies and employees is the same as that in rival countries.

The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS), the Chamber of Craft and Small Business (OZS), the Chamber of Commerce (TZS) and a couple of associations representing employers have been urging solutions for months, but to no avail.

They would now like to see the transition period extended by at least a year to come up with a better solution to make sure Slovenian employers would not lose their competitive edge or move their companies abroad, the organisations said in a press release on Tuesday.

What added fuel to the fire is the fact that the government found a solution to ensure diplomats' salaries will not be affected by the changes in 2024.

According to N1 news portal, the solution is written into the draft law on the implementation of the 2023 and 2024 budgets, where Article 80 sets down that in the case of civil servants posted abroad the salary they would have received for the same work in Slovenia will continue to be used as the tax base for contributions next year.

Diplomats' gross salaries abroad are significantly higher than at home, and with the payment of contributions based on their actual salaries, they would receive much lower net payments, which are reportedly already among the lowest in the EU.

This led to disagreements over the incoming new system between the Foreign Ministry and the Labour Ministry, which it seems have been resolved to heed the objections by the former.

Providing arguments for Article 80, the government said that civil servants working abroad performed their duties as representatives of the state and, as such, could not be considered unfair competition in the same way as employees of companies providing a particular service on the market.

""Civil servants are not competitors in relation to civil servants from other EU countries, and so European regulations do not mention them,"" it added. Before the legislative changes, Slovenian posted workers were deemed unfair competition, which triggered an EU procedure against Slovenia and prompted the new law.

The GZS now threatens a constitutional review of the exception involving civil servants posted abroad.

Supporting the employers' request, the junior opposition party New Slovenia (NSi) filed a proposal to amend the law to extend the transitional period.",labour
RTV Slovenija takes govt to court for reimbursement of labour costs,"RTV Slovenija has taken the government to court claiming EUR 24 million in compensation for higher labour costs. The government pledged to compensate the public broadcaster for the costs in the 2018 strike agreement but has failed to deliver on the promise, RTV Slovenija acting director general Andrej Grah Whatmough said on Tuesday.","Announcing the lawsuit filed on Monday, Grah Whatmough also said that since he had taken over in April 2021, he and his team had managed to stabilise the public broadcaster's finances.

By identifying redundant employees, they have managed to save EUR 5 million in labour costs, ""which no other RTV management has managed to do until now"". As a result, RTV finished 2022 without a loss for the first time, he added.

As for the broadcaster's liquidity, he said that a day after paying salaries, ""we still have EUR 3 million in our account"".

Some insiders have been warning in recent weeks that this money is the result of a sale of Eutelsat shares that the government says was unlawful.

Grah Whatmough said the broadcaster had no debt, planned no loans, while its future financial situation is ""partially in the hands of the government"".

It will be the government's ""responsibility if the public broadcaster faces bankruptcy, or the Greek scenario,"" he stressed.

Just like previous governments, the current government is not responding to the many calls to provide for stable finances, said Grah Whatmough.

He mentioned the Greek scenario in reference to MP Borut Sajovic from the ruling Freedom Movement saying on Monday that ""the incompetent RTV leadership is taking the broadcaster into bankruptcy and the Greek scenario"".

""I'd like to assure you that RTV Slovenija is facing neither bankruptcy nor the Greek scenario. At least not for now,"" said the RTV Slovenija boss.

He stressed that the government has not yet implemented the strike agreement from 2018, failing to raise the funds for labour costs despite committing to do so.

""This is why we decided, together with RTV trade unions, to take the founder [Republic of Slovenia] to court to get compensation for the costs"".

Grah Whatmough also commented on the court rulings on the basis of which the coalition parties are seeking dismissal by parliament of nine members of the RTV programme council.

The Higher Labour Court decided in March that Grah Whatmough's appointment in January 2021 was unlawful because he did not meet one of the job requirements - three years of managerial experience.

But Grah Whatmough said this requirement is not set down in the broadcaster's articles of association, which brings up the question whether the programme council can set job requirements past them. To clear this up, RTV has asked the Supreme Court to review the ruling.",labour
"Doubts about relevance of food prices tracker, as prices drop again","The prices of basic food products included in the government-sponsored comparison campaign continued to drop in January, reaching the lowest level since September 2022, when the price tracker was launched. In the face of inflation, the EUR 58,000 project of price comparison is increasingly being seen as ineffective and inaccurate.","The average price of 15 basic food products cost EUR 40.30 on 31 January, about one euro less than two weeks ago, the Agriculture Ministry said in a press release.

Lidl was once again the cheapest retailer, with the 15 products costing EUR 38.66. Spar was in second place (EUR 39.09), followed by Hofer (EUR 39.76), Tuš (EUR 41.05) and Mercator (EUR 43.71).

Since September the biggest drop in prices was seen in pork, which became 27% cheaper, and cheese, which went down 24%, while beef became 18% more affordable. On the other hand, sugar gained 45.5% compared to September, while eggs went up by nearly 16% and apples almost 11%.

The price tracker, launched by the government as a softer alternative to price regulation, has been criticised even before its launch. Now, two months before the end of the six-month project, discrepancies between the tracker data and official statistics are becoming increasingly pronounced.

""Retailers are strategically lowering the prices of the tracked foods, even at their own cost, because none want to be seen as the most expensive,"" Sašo Polanec, a professor at the Ljubljana Economy Faculty, told the newspaper Delo.

While the government tracker data indicate a drop in prices, data from the Statistics Office (SURS), which is following the prices of some 70,000 products, has shown a significant hike in prices. Polanec says that SURS data should be believed over the tracker, as the latter includes too small a sample.

The Consumer Association (ZPS) echoed this position, noting that annual inflation reached some 10%, while the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 16% between September and December 2022.

The association believes retailers might be reducing the prices of the 15 products included in the tracker, while other prices are growing. It noted that an overview of prices of bread showed that prices of some types of bread increased by over 27% since September.

What is more, out of the six retailers included in the campaign, only Spar believes the tracker is showing a realistic picture. Hofer told Delo that the products whose prices are being tracked are ""often sold with negative margins"".

Eurospin said that creditworthy and unbiased results could only be achieved if the prices were tracked at random, the number of products was higher and the products were known in advance. The retailer also expressed doubt about the knowledge of those involved, and the creditworthiness of the comparison method.

Moreover, Tuš questioned the method of comparing products of different quality. The paper pointed to what was described by the ministry as considerable increase in the prices of meat due to a 33.19% hike in the prices of pork.

However, there was no such increase, as most products kept roughly the same price as two weeks prior. The reason for the increase was a decision by one retailer to start selling a new premium product, which was several times more expensive than other meats.",labour
Project predicts decline in job vacancies after 2027,"The number of job vacancies will be increasing until 2027 and then it will start to decline, indicate the results of a project carried out by the Labour Ministry and Employment Service. Until 2037, new jobs will be available mainly to experts. The economy will demand above all tertiary-educated workers or those with secondary school education.","The findings of the project Skills Forecasting Platform were presented at a conference in Brdo pri Kranju this week.

The challenges of labour shortages will get more difficult and will limit economic growth, citizens' satisfaction with services, and the competitiveness of the economy, said Gonzalo Caprirolo, head of the ministry's office for analysis and development.

""The project provides key data to tackle these challenges, filling the gap in estimates of future labour market needs or providing information for action,"" he added.

The number of unfilled job vacancies is very big today, and the number of citizens who are entering the labour market for the first time is lower than the number of those who just retired, and one times smaller than what the labour market needs. An increasing share of the labour market needs are met by foreign labour.

The labour supply of workers aged 20-64 will continue to decline and constrain economic growth, Caprirolo said.

The number of job vacancies will start to decline after 2027. From 2023 to 2027 it will stand at some 27,900, between 2028 and 2032 it will be at about 23,800 and in the 2033-2037 period it will decline to just over 24,100.

In the long term, vacancies will mainly be available to experts, and when it comes to other jobs people will be hired only as replacements.

Employment will continue to increase in certain areas, such as science and engineering, the information and communications sector, the hospitality industry, cultural, entertainment and recreational services, waste management and environmental protection, and healthcare and social care.

On the other hand, the forecasts say that the number of vacancies will decrease in a number of areas, including education, construction, administration, the financial and insurance sector, transport and storage, retail, agriculture, and most of all, in manufacturing.

Until 2037, most vacancies will seek experts in maths, science, engineering and technology, and in business and management. ""Above all, the economy will need tertiary-educated people and those with secondary school education,"" said Caprirolo.

The project, which has been a joint effort of several ministries and government offices since 2019, is important because long-term forecasts facilitate efforts to address future challenges or mitigate certain issues, such as gaps or imbalances in the labour market, said the Labour Ministry's State Secretary Igor Feketija.",labour
Mayors threaten with higher kindergarten bills due to wage raise,"The mayors of the urban municipalities have met to discuss the increasing labour costs in kindergartens, calling on the government to at least partially cover for the higher costs. Otherwise, they said they would be forced to raise prices as early as in February due to the unsustainable financial standing of kindergartens.","The mayors said at Monday's emergency session of the Association of the Urban Municipalities that their municipalities had not been included in the talks that had led to the agreement to raise wages of kindergarten teachers.

As the founders of public kindergartens, the urban municipalities bear the financial consequences of this agreement, they said, noting that the urban municipalities had no funds to cover the higher labour costs in kindergartens.

""Labour costs represent the bulk of the price of kindergarten programmes. The amount of additional costs in individual municipalities has reaches multi-million sums,"" the mayors said in a press release on Tuesday.

If the state fails to cover the increase from the budget, ""the urban municipalities will be forced to raise the price of kindergartens, with the majority of the costs to be borne by the parents,"" they announced.

The association has asked the government for a quick response, otherwise the urban municipalities will be forced to raise the prices as early as in February due to the unsustainable financial standing of kindergartens.

Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik commented on the request by noting that the government had approved a few months ago the largest per capita lump-sum funding for municipalities, EUR 700.

""Such a high per capita lump-sum was agreed also due to the increased labour costs borne by municipal budgets,"" the minister said, noting that the expectation expressed by the municipalities was unfounded.",labour
Public sector trade unions threaten with protest on 24 February,"Several public sector trade unions have called on the government to come up with a solution to pay challenges, eliminate pay disparities among various groups, and preserve the public sector pay system, or else they will organise a protest rally for decent pay on 24 February.","At Wednesday's press conference, one of the negotiating groups said that for the past two months the government had ignored the deadline set for starting talks to overhaul the public sector pay system and to address pay compression in one third of the pay brackets at the bottom of the pay scale.

By agreeing pay deals with individual groups of public sector employees, such as doctors or judges, the government is creating solutions that are radically changing the public sector pay system, bringing unequal treatment and unsustainable pay rations, the trade unionists said.

The negotiating group thus decided on a protest for decent pay to take place on 24 February unless the government immediately offers concrete solutions with a timeline.

The unions expect the solutions to eliminate the pay disparities in base pay that have been created with the recently agreed pay rises with certain groups.

They expect the government to raise the lowest pay to the level of the minimum wage, as many pay brackets are below the minimum wage.

Another demand is that the public sector pay system be preserved based on the principle of ""the same pay for comparable work"".

And they also expect the government to secure a consensus from public sector trade unions on the solutions on these ""key issues of the pay system"".",labour
"Employers claiming wage compensation for over 14,000 workers post-floods","Employers have claimed wage compensation for 14,415 employees who are unable to work because of the early August floods, data from the national Employment Service show.","Employers filed 2,110 applications for wage compensation for 14,415 workers between 17 August and 7 September in three different categories.

Most of them are related to a partial compensation due to force majeure (9,197 workers) and furloughed workers (4,547), both under the first emergency act passed post-floods.

The second emergency law introduced wage compensation for workers reassigned to do post-flood clear-ups with the employer.

Employers have between 4 and 18 September to apply for aid in this category, and in the first four days alone, 67 employers filed applications for 671 employees.

Furloughed workers are also compensated 80%, but not below the minimum wage, and the measure is in place until the end of the year, with the option of extension.

For this category of workers, employers will receive only 80% of the wage they will pay to the workers, and the highest state compensation is capped with the average salary in May 2023.

Govt plans to adjust fuel margins to inflation,"The government is working on a new set of rules for fuel retail margins, under which the margins would be adjusted to annual inflation, shows a draft plan for regulating fuel prices in 2023 and 2024.","Retail prices are currently regulated outside the motorway network and are adjusted every two weeks based on the euro-dollar exchange rate and the prices of oil derivatives in international markets.

The partial regulation was reintroduced on 21 June 2022 for a year.

In line with the draft government plan, which was published last week, these margins would be adjusted to the annual inflation this year and the next.

In 2024, based on the European Commission's forecast of a 6.1% annual inflation, the margin for diesel would rise to 11.5 cents per litre, for regular petrol it would reach 11.63 cents and for heating oil 9.36 cents.

That is why the Third Development Axis project is really vital,"" the mayor said about the planned north-to-south expressway project.

The new bridge was built by the company maintaining the roads in Koroška, Voc Celje. The owners of the former chipboard factory, the Hancman company, and the municipality temporarily contributed land for the access road.

The bridge has no load capacity restrictions and can also be used by cyclists and pedestrians, although the mayor advised pedestrians to use it only in emergencies.

Railway transport to Koroška is also gradually being restored. So far trains from Maribor could go only as far as Podvelka, while today the first passenger train is expected in Dravograd. The connection on to Prevalje is planned to reopen by Monday, 4 September.

As for rail connection to Austria, Rajh said the problem was a landslide in Austria, where works would some time.

The Infrastructure Ministry official announced more projects for Koroška, but would not go into detail.

In the Mežica municipality, where the swollen Meža destroyed all the bridges, two new bridges are to be built soon after the first bridge was set up by Slovenian and Macedonian soldiers on 14 August.

A team from Poland will erect a modular bridge that will connect the residents of five houses with the city by the end of the month. The works are expected to start this weekend, said municipal official Blaž Šaloven.

Another bridge, enabling access by car to a family house and the company Kogelnik will be erected by a team from Czechia. The works will start next week and are expected to be finished by 10 September.",labour

Šumi candy brand halts production at Krško plant,"Slovenia's best known candy brand Šumi has suspended production at its factory in Krško, east of the country, as part of austerity measures put in place due to high energy prices, brand owner Žito told the news portal Siol. According to unofficial information, production will be halted until the end of March.","The production of candy and chewing gums has been halted since the beginning of the month and now cleaning and maintenance work on the machinery, which is usually carried out in summer, is being conducted.

Workers are on a leave or using the overtime they had accumulated earlier. Some are helping out at Žito's other operating locations, the food company told Siol. The transport to and from these locations has been organised by the company.

Once Slovenia's largest confectionery factory, Šumi is today a brand of Žito, the Slovenian bread and pasta group which was acquired in 2015 by Croatian food group Podravka.

In 2008, Šumi relocated its candy and chewing gum production from Ljubljana to Krško, where it now employs some 60 workers.

Survey shows people got slightly happier with life in past four years,"Overall satisfaction with life improved among people in Slovenia in the past four years, suggests a survey conducted by the Statistics Office for 2022. Compared to 2018, people were also more content with their financial situation and the amount of leisure time, while satisfaction with interpersonal relationships remained at the same level.","The survey, conducted in the first half of 2022 among residents older than 16 and released on Tuesday, had 27% of the respondents rate their level of general satisfaction with life with nine or ten on a 0-10 scale.

There were differences in feelings of happiness by age group, especially between young people (16-24 years) and older people (65 years or older), with the former feeling happy more of the time. However, young people felt lonely all or most of the time in about the same proportion as older people.

Subjective perception proved an important factor when it comes to people's satisfactions with their financial situation. The average level of satisfaction in this category reached 6.7 last year, up by 0.4 compared to 2018 and by 5.6 compared to 2013.

Very high scores, with an average of eight, were given by those who thought they could easily make it through the month on their income.

More than a third of the respondents rated their satisfaction with the amount of leisure time available to them with 9 or 10. The average score here increased by 0.3 to 7.5 compared to 2018. There were no differences according to gender, while there were differences in terms of employment status, with the self-employed being the least (6.6) and the retired (8.4) the most content.

A majority of Slovenians (56%) assess the current situation in the country as good, which is 15 percentage points above the EU average (41%).

Slovenians are divided when it comes to the state of the economy, while their assessment of the state of the EU economy is more optimistic, as 55% believe it to be good. This is higher than the EU average, which is two out of five.

However, respondents in Slovenia are more pessimistic regarding the direction in which the developments in Slovenia are going.

Just under half (48%) believe that Slovenia is going in the wrong direction, and only a third think the opposite.

Some 47% of the respondents from Slovenia are satisfied with the functioning of democracy in Slovenia, which is below the EU average, while Slovenians are slightly more satisfied with the functioning of democracy in the EU as a whole.

Slovenians are critical of the credibility of the national media - a majority of the respondents believe that they are not trustworthy, as they work under political or market pressure and that they often present misleading or incorrect information.

The respondents in Slovenia mostly do not expect many changes in economy in the next 12 months, with more than half (55%) thinking that their lives will not change in the next twelve months in this respect.

Net migration in 2022 positive,"Last year, 35,900 Slovenian and foreign citizens immigrated to Slovenia, while slightly over 20,900 people emigrated.

Paper says ideology should have no place in nutrition policy,"The regional newspaper Primorske Novice welcomes the creation of an inter-departmental advisory body on nutrition policy in Wednesday's commentary, but warns against including ideology in this field as well.","The paper finds increased care for growing crops for direct food consumption is good news for Slovenian farmers and consumers.

""More than half of vegetables on the Slovenian market are imported, we import 40% worth of potato consumption, a good half from Egypt. Official statistics show more than two million tonnes of food and beverages are imported a year, more than three-quarters being processed food. Even with the tourists, we cannot digest it all, so it must be some kind of a retail loop.""

The paper goes on to say that Slovenia's self sufficiency has not improved despite in-depth analyses, long resolutions and wise words about development of agriculture over the past two decades and farmers have only faced more red tape.

It welcomes the creation of a new advisory body on food, but finds it odd that farmers and food industry representatives have not been included, which is to be corrected.

It believes a different approach could change self sufficiency and food security and possibly citizens' eating habits, but says more should be done in the department of food prices, because for many the price is often the key factor of choice.

""The story of a healthy diet is based on its variety and seasonality [...] fish today, blood sausages tomorrow, tofu the day after tomorrow. It would be dangerous and stupid to include ideology and prejudice even in nutrition. It would also be tiring, because our society is excessively permeated with divisions of all kinds as it is,"" the paper concludes under the headline Blood Sausages, Fish, Tofu.",lifestyle and leisure

Awards piling up for Seascape's latest sailing yacht,"The latest boat from Seascape, a Slovenian sailboat development and production company, has become the most awarded sailboat in the nautical industry. The Beneteau First 36, a speedy cruiser, has also won the title of European Sailing Yacht of the Year 2023.","The sailboat and the process that led to its production was presented to the press in Podpeč near Ljubljana on Monday by the Seascape team, led by director Andraž Mihelin.

He explained that the Beneteau First 36 is the type of sailboat that used to be the most widespread at sea 30 years ago. ""These boats could be compared to a Swiss army knife, because they can do almost anything. They are suitable for a regatta, a cruise or just a short relaxation after work,"" he said.

Over the years, this segment dwindled, having been replaced by specialised sailing boats. Seascape therefore set about creating a boat both modern in its design and multifunctional. ""This boat is exactly that. We believe and can now prove that it sails as well as a sports boat, while offering enough interior design and comfort to be suitable for cruising,"" Mihelin said.

He explained that following the 2018 merger with French company Beneteau - the partnership was later modified so that Beneteau now has a minority stake in the Slovenian company - the previously independent Seascape ""took on the responsibility of reviving Beneteau's iconic 40-year-old First line of sailing boats"".

Matic Lenaršič, another member of the Seascape team, explained that the boat is also the product of extensive market research. The company conducted detailed interviews on three continents, as the wishes and needs of sailors on each continent are different. ""It was only through a detailed insight into the user experience that we were able to achieve true design success,"" he said.

The Beneteau First 36 has won several awards, being declared the American, French and English sailing yacht of the year. But Mihelin says the European Sailing Yacht of the Year 2023 has opened the most doors for them, as evidenced by the number of orders with paid deposits, which has reached 95.",lifestyle and leisure

They will also be able to view videos or listen to further explanations by scanning QR codes on the displays.

The trail is open to visitors on foot and cyclists and can be reached by car or city bus.

The land where the trail was build was gifted by the municipality of Ljubljana, said Janez Kastelic, director of the Ljubljana Marshes Nature Park. Before the trail was created, there was a landfill and the land was overgrown. Kastelic hopes that people will enjoy the trail and said that they intend to expand the project.

The trail is part of the project PoLJUBA, which aims to restore and preserve marsh habitats in the Ljubljana Marshes. The EUR 4.1 million project, which began in 2018 and will end in September, was mostly funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

As part of the project farming and grass mowing in the region were adapted to the wildlife and overgrown meadows were restored. This improved the habitats of species endangered by intensive farming and changing hydrological conditions.

Two species - the false ringlet butterfly and the hermit beetle - were about to disappear from the Ljubljana Marshes but their populations have since bounced back.",lifestyle and leisure
Justice minister says govt serious about fixing pay disparities in judiciary,"Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan underlined on Friday the willingness of the government to accommodate the efforts of judges, prosecutors and other judicial official to fix pay disparities. She said the EUR 600 gross monthly bonus that was announced for them this week was a temporary measure in place until a systemic solution is found.","In a response to a question by coalition Freedom Movement MP Urška Klakočar Zupančič about the timeline of the measures, Pipan explained that 1,093 judges and prosecutors would be receiving the bonus and that the annual cost of the measure was estimated at EUR 9.1 million.

The minister said the step was a sign the government was serious about implementing one of the key coalition agreement commitments - to fix, after many years, the wage disparities in the judicial system and secure judges' independence.

She noted the measures came after the government already initialled in September last year with public sector trade unions a deal on measures addressing wages and other labour costs for 2022 and 2023. The deal determined that pay for all wage brackets increase by 4.5% in October 2022.

The latest changes to the act on public sector wages will moreover bring a one-pay bracket promotion for all public servants on 1 April, while an additional, 66th pay bracket is being added to the public sector pay system.

Švarc Pipan added that the existing rankings of individual public servants and their wages needed to be reviewed and that the disparities would be addressed as part of an overhaul of the public sector pay system. A bill to this effect is expected by 30 June at the latest.","crime, law and justice"
"EU Commission sees progress in Slovenian justice system, media","The quality of the Slovenian justice system has further improved, while the situation of media freedom and pluralism continues to face challenges, although positive developments are noted, the European Commission says in its latest Rule of Law Report. The country is urged to take additional measures, including to protect journalists.","Slovenia has made some progress in line with last year's recommendations, including on media freedom and the justice system, the Commission says in the annual report released today, which covers the justice system, fight against corruption, media freedom and pluralism, and the system of checks and balances. It also contains recommendations for each member state.

In judiciary, the Commission notes some progress on ensuring that rules on parliamentary inquiries contain adequate safeguards for independence of judges and state prosecutors, as the Commission recommended last year.

Slovenia is urged to continue with efforts in this respect as well as ensure that the reform of judicial appointments contains adequate safeguards for judicial independence. Slovenia should also take measures to increase the remuneration of judges and state prosecutors, the report says.

""The situation of media freedom and pluralism continues to face challenges, although positive developments are noted with respect to a more favourable climate for media. The government announced an overhaul of the media legislation to address the structural challenges of the regulatory framework and foster transparency, plurality and resilience of the media landscape.""

According to the Commission, Slovenia ""fully implemented the recommendation on strengthening the rules and mechanisms to enhance the independent governance and editorial independence of public service media taking into account European standards on public service media"".

The Commission also notes that in 2022, the financial situation of the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) improved. A new law was adopted to reform the governance structure of the public services media and safeguards introduced for their independence. The government took initial steps with regard to the protection of journalists, the report says.

Still, over the last year, challenges to the independence of public broadcaster RTV Slovenija persisted, with issues reportedly related to the appointment to the management roles, alleged mobbing and smearing of RTV Slovenija staff, and the adoption by the RTV Slovenija's management of controversial measures on staffing and programming, the report says.

Considering that under new rules introduced by changes to the RTV Slovenija law the governing and managerial bodies are no longer directly appointed by parliament, the ""possibility for any government, through its parliamentary majority, to exert political influence on RTV Slovenija is expected to be significantly reduced"".

""Pending the final decision of the Constitutional Court on the merit, the newly adopted rules are therefore expected to enhance the independent governance and editorial independence of public service media.""

The report also notes that the government has taken ""some initial steps to address challenges related to the safety of journalists"" and that some progress had been made on establishing non-legislative safeguards to protect journalists, particularly online.

The Commission found Slovenia fully implemented its recommendation on ""removing obstacles to the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases, including by ensuring the operational autonomy of the National Bureau of Investigation, increasing the resources of State Prosecution and revising the statute of limitation"".

Some progress was also made as regards adopting and start implementing the anti-corruption strategy. The country is urged to ""adopt the new anti-corruption strategy and action plan with concrete measures and a timeframe for their implementation and step up efforts to ensure a track record of investigations, prosecutions and final judgements in corruption offences, including in high-level cases"".

As for checks and balances, the Commission says that Slovenia also fully implemented the recommendation on ""ensuring requisite safeguards for budgetary autonomy of the independent bodies"".","crime, law and justice"
More employees in judiciary request bonuses,"After the government promised EUR 600 gross monthly bonuses to judges and public prosecutors, the remaining employees in the judiciary have asked for bonuses amounting to half of that sum, otherwise they could stop working overtime and perform the minimum amount of work stipulated by law.","The Trade Union of Workers in the Judiciary said on Thursday that the government was addressing issues in the public sector pay system in a ""discriminatory manner"", as changes affected only certain professions.

It called on the government to engage in social dialogue and raise wages of all employees in the judiciary, demanding bonuses for all employees in the sector until a reform is passed.

It noted that the functioning of the judiciary did not only rely on judges and prosecutors, but also on court staff and other civil servants in the system, who were paid less than civil servants in comparable posts across the state administration.

The trade union demands from the government and employers that anomalies within the system be eliminated, and EUR 300 gross monthly bonuses be introduced as of 1 January for all employees with the ISCED levels of education 4 to 8.

If this does not happen, it will call on the employees to stop working overtime and switch to the minimum amount of work stipulated by law, which is as much as they are currently paid for, said the trade union president Tomaž Virnik.

They also pointed to staff shortages both in the courts and in prisons, which are causing delays in trials, adding that if decisive moves were not made, there would be serious disruptions in the functioning of the judicial branch of power.

Prison officer Branko Gverič said that a ""huge shortage of staff"" could be felt in their ranks, estimating the shortage at some 50%, and adding that at least 900 new prison officers would have to be hired.

The trade union also noted that the base pay of around half of the employees in the judiciary was below the minimum wage, and that the latest increase in the minimum wage would push even more civil servants below this threshold.","crime, law and justice"
Police presence around Slovenian schools to be beefed up,"In the face of tragic shooting incidents in Serbia, police presence around Slovenian schools will be temporarily beefed up. Police are ready to cooperate with schools in efforts for early discovery of potential violent incidents.","""It is our duty to become even more vigilant in Slovenian schools against any form of behaviour that could indicate problems of pupils or students that could eventually be perceived as impossible to overcome and could possibly lead to fatal actions,"" the Education Ministry said on Friday.

The ministry therefore cooperates with all relevant institutions working in the field of early detection and prevention of violence, both inside and outside the school environment.

It is important to provide all pupils, students, parents and staff in educational institutions with a sense of security, which is a prerequisite for a normal functioning school environment, the ministry said, expressing condolences to the relatives of the victims of the two tragic incidents in Serbia.

In the face of the school shooting in Belgrade, calls can be heard in Slovenia for changes to the school system to make it more sensitive to children.

Gregor Pečen, the head of the alliance of head teachers, told the STA that schools have limited options, as children learn behavioural patterns in their families.

It is illusionary to expect one-hundred-percent readiness for events such was Wednesday's school shooting in Belgrade, he said. ""Nowhere in the world are schools ready for anything like this, because they can't be,"" he said.

Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan commented on the issue of lowering the age limit for criminal responsibility of children from 14 to 12 years, which has also been raised in the context of the Belgrade shooting.

She noted that criminal repression was a last resort when it comes to adolescents. All efforts should be directed towards preventing access to weapons to adolescents, she stressed, expressing deep shock at the events in Serbia and expressing condolences to the victims' relatives.

Measures to prevent violence among the young will also be a topic of government sessions in the coming days, with the minister warning against any rash measures, especially measures that may seem appealing at first but would not bring the expected results or could be even potentially harmful.","crime, law and justice"
PM expresses support for Ukraine war tribunal at Bucha summit,"Prime Minister Robert Golob expressed Slovenia's support for the establishment of a special tribunal for Russian crimes against Ukraine, as he attended a summit on Russia's responsibility for crimes in Ukraine during his visit to the country on Friday.","He once again reiterated Slovenia's condemnation of Russia's attack against Ukraine, which he said was unprovoked and unnecessary. The summit was also attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu, and prime ministers of Croatia and Slovakia, Andrej Plenković and Eduard Heger.

The atrocities carried out in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine are a severe violation of human rights and the international humanitarian law, said Golob, who was in Bucha today to commemorate the civilian victims of the war on the first anniversary of the liberation of the city.

""We must strive for a world in which international law is upheld and justice is served. This is the only way to achieve a fair and lasting peace,"" said Golob. All perpetrators must be brought in front of a tribunal to make sure that such atrocities will never be repeated.

The prime minister's office said that Slovenia was an adamant advocate of international criminal law and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Moreover, Slovenia is helping Ukraine in any way it can in efforts to have perpetrators tried.

Slovenia welcomes the ICC's warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian commissioner for children's rights over illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia, the PM's office also said.

When asked by the STA about security in Europe, Zelensky said that Russia's decision to place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus meant that Putin's talks with China's President Xi Jinping did not bring the result Putin wanted. He reiterated that Ukraine did not support the war but was striving for victory and peace.

Heger meanwhile highlighted the importance of the war's outcome for the future. He underlined that there could be only one peace plan and that was Ukraine's peace plan.

Plenković underlined the importance of patriotism in Ukraine and the support of international community for Ukraine, and stressed that Western countries must remain united.","crime, law and justice"
"Asylum seekers say they are not criminals, but workers",A civil society group advocating for the rights of asylum seekers held a press conference in front of the National Assembly building on Tuesday to call for immediate suspension of deportations and the right to a residence permit for all asylum seekers who work. They also call for better treatment by the police and government.,"The group said that ""asylum seekers are not criminals, but workers"" and also called for an end to ""racist treatment by the police and government"".

""Imagine how you would feel if you saw your photo in the news with the headline 'security threat,'"" said Nigerian Arinze Bauldwin Anumuduihe, noting that this was the reality that migrants woke up to every day.

The civil initiative argues that politicians, the police and the media talk about them as a ""migrant hazard"", and that an increasing number of people are throwing insults at them, so they have gathered to call for such behaviour to stop.

Miha Blažič of the Ambasada Rog organisation said that the message to the government was that workers were not a commodity that could be imported or exported, but that they were people who have their own lives and demand dignity and respect.

He noted that the government had been providing conflicting information in recent weeks, as it said that Slovenia needed manpower, while at the same time migrants were being deported.

""All asylum seekers got a job the moment they got their work permits,"" Blažič said, adding that the demand for them was very high and noting that asylum seekers were among the first ones to ""pick up shovels"" for repair work after the floods.

""The situation is absurd and shows that the government has no clear policy on migration,"" he said, calling on the authorities to stop the ""deportations"" and to enable all those who work to stay in the country.

Anumuduihe added that ""we work hard every day, contribute to society and pay taxes"", and asked whether they were worthy of some basic respect in return, adding that asylum seekers wanted nothing else but a chance to live and work in peace.

Adje Brou Romain, who has been living in fear of the government of Ivory Coast since 2011, noted the treatment by the Croatian police, who ""dehumanised him"", and said that he lived under the risk of being returned to Croatia.

He called on the interior minister and other authorities to ""understand me and enable me to stay in Slovenia"".

Tina Hajdinjak, who coordinated the clean-up effort in Sneberje, north-east of Ljubljana, after the August floods, said that asylum seekers had raised the morale of locals by helping out. ""They have established a bridge between them and locals.""

The press conference was attended by Dan Juvan, a state secretary at the Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Ministry, who noted that the demands of asylum seekers were very simple.

Those who want to work and live in Slovenia should be enabled to do so and the relevant procedures should be simplified, he said, while also thanking asylum seekers for helping out during the post-flood reconstruction effort.

Juvan said that the coalition Left and his ministry were working on facilitating and regulating these procedures. ""I also call on others to listen to the appeals of these people and enable them to work and live in Slovenia,"" he added.","crime, law and justice"
Slovenia joins EU action against Hungary over anti-LGBT law,The government decided on Thursday that Slovenia would join the European Commission's lawsuit against Hungary over the latter's anti-LGBT law. A number of member states and the European Parliament are supporting the Commission's legal action at the EU Court of Justice over what is deemed a discriminatory law.,"""Slovenia wants to express its firm support for basic values that form the foundation of the EU: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities,"" the Labour Ministry said in a press release following the government session.

Hungary enacted in 2021 a number of bans and limitations for the media, advertising and education, on contents promoting or portraying identification other than that equal to one's sex at birth, gender reassignment, or homosexuality for persons under 18.

The Commission decided last summer to refer Hungary to the Court of Justice, saying the law discriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.

It also found that ""the law violates the internal market rules, the fundamental rights of individuals (in particular LGBTIQ people) as well as - with regard to those fundamental rights - the EU values"".

The legal action has been endorsed by Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, as well as the European Parliament.","crime, law and justice"
Croatian fishermen too turn to Human Rights Court,"After Slovenian fishermen who have been receiving fines from Croatia for fishing in the Piran Bay, where the border has been set by the 2017 border arbitration decision, turned to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), Croatian fishermen who have been receiving fines from Slovenia have done the same, Slovenian lawyer Miha Kozinc told the STA.","According to Kozinc, who represented the Croatian fishermen in proceedings in Slovenia, the fishermen turned to the ECHR after exhausting all legal means in Slovenia.

In Strasbourg, they will be represented by Croatian lawyers.

The Slovenian Foreign Ministry told the STA today it had not been officially informed of the move yet.

Slovenian fishermen turned to the ECHR in mid-March, and the court found their lawsuits admissible.

The ECHR notified Slovenia at the end of March that three complaints against Croatia filed by the Slovenian fishermen alleging violations of the European Convention on Human Rights had already been served on Croatia.

The Slovenian government decided at the beginning of the month that Slovenia will intervene in the lawsuit in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that the member state of the complainants has this right.

Slovenia informed the ECHR of its intervention on 5 June ahead of the 16 June deadline. The court will now set a deadline for Slovenia's application after receiving Croatia's reply, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.

Slovenia and Croatia have been issuing fines to fishermen thought to be fishing outside national borders in the Piran Bay since Croatia does not recognise the decision of the border arbitration tribunal, which awarded most of the bay to Slovenia. Croatia insists that the border runs through the middle of the bay.

Neither Slovenian nor Croatian fishermen had been paying the fines but had instead been lodging appeals. After exhausting all legal options for appeal in Slovenia and Croatia, including at the constitutional courts, both turned to the ECHR.

Sources at the Slovenian Foreign Ministry have recently said that if the ECHR takes on the case, the main question will probably be where the fishermen did the fishing. If the ECHR nods to the Slovenian fishermen's appeal, it will in a way legitimise the arbitration award.","crime, law and justice"
Illegal migration up almost three-fold in first half of 2023,"The Slovenian police processed 20,274 illegal crossings of the border in the first six months of 2023, which is almost three times more than in the same period last year. Citizens of Afghanistan, Morocco and Bangladesh were the most frequently involved in illegal crossings of the border in that period.","In the first half of the year, as many as 72.4% of all illegal crossings of the border were recorded in the area covered by the Novo Mesto Police Department (southeast), while 19.7% were processed by the Koper Police Department (southwest).

The number of expressed intentions to submit applications for international protection was up considerably compared to the first half of 2022, almost four-fold to 19,451.

Citizenship-wise, the largest number of applications for international protection was filed by citizens of Afghanistan, followed by citizens of Morocco, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Russia.","crime, law and justice"
Parliamentary inquiry of political influence on police launched,"The National Assembly has initiated a parliamentary inquiry to investigate suspected political influence by office holders on the police and other independent state bodies. The inquiry, requested by the ruling Freedom Movement, will cover the terms of the previous and current government up to now.","The aim of the investigation is to find whether the members of both the Janez Janša and the Robert Golob governments meddled in specific police procedures or wanted to prevent the police from doing their job or hinder their work.

This is a continuation of the investigation during the previous government, ordered by the then opposition, which did not go beyond a reading of an interim report, noted Miha Lamut from the Freedom Movement in the request for the inquiry.

Under the previous government the police was subjugated to the political ambitions of the then ruling Democrats (SDS), said Nataša Avšič Bogovič from the Freedom Movement. The interim report of the investigation, requested by the opposition, contained many incriminating findings, she added.

The Social Democrats (SD) believe that the list of accusations to be investigated is long. The party will fight for the justice of those that were injured because of political meddling, said SD MP Damijan Zrim.

It is necessary to respond to threats to the autonomy and professionalism of the police and nip them in the bud, said Tatjana Greif from the Left.

The opposition Democrats (SDS) noted that relationships between police officers had deteriorated due to the ""political mangling"" during the current government. They accuse each other and write anonymous complaints, Žan Mahnič said. According to Mahnič, what the coalition wants now is a ""witch hunt"" and to blur the fact that it is Prime Minister Golob who is meddling in the police.

The request for investigation is completely legitimate said Vida Čadonič Špelič from the opposition New Slovenia (NSi). The party feels there is a political fight involved and urge the parliamentary inquiry commission to not forget its purpose in the inquiry.","crime, law and justice"
Coalition to support candidate for Supreme Court president,"After Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan proposed that the National Assembly appoint Miodrag Đorđević as the Supreme Court president, the candidate has now been promised support from all three coalition parties.","A vote on Đorđević's appointment will take place at a regular session of the National Assembly this month. Next week, the Privileges and Credentials Commission will discuss and vote on Đorđević's nomination.

The three coalition parties have already announced that they will support his candidacy. ""The Freedom Movement has been a strong supporter of the judiciary being autonomous and also recognises how important it is to trust experts' points of view and their opinion,"" the senior coalition party said.

Both the Judicial Council and the assembly of Supreme Court judges endorsed Đorđević's candidacy before the minister proposed him as the candidate, with the Judicial Council pointing out his expertise, years of experience, and saying he had done good work as the Supreme Court's incumbent vice-president.

Some reservations have recently been expressed due to the candidate's age as the 67-year-old will not be able to complete the six-year term; under the law, a judge cannot be older than 70 in Slovenia. Nevertheless, the Judicial Council expressed their full support for him and warned that such reservations could be seen as discrimination.

Incumbent Supreme Court President Damijan Florjančič's term expires in February and Đorđević was the only candidate to apply for the post in the third public call after no candidate came forward in the first two.","crime, law and justice"
New judicial year starts as Đorđević is taking over as Supreme Court president,"The start of the new judicial year was marked at Court Palace in Ljubljana on Tuesday with senior officials praising the progress the judiciary has made while pointing to the issues yet to be fully addressed, including inadequate premises and low pay, especially as they require cooperation by the other branches of government.","Outgoing Supreme Court President Damijan Florjančič said that courts had a positive year - they processed more cases than they received, processed cases quickly, and despite staffing issues, digitalisation is about to be fully implemented and the judiciary's transparency also improved.

Courts have implemented what is within their powers, but their activities also depend on the other branches of government, said Florjančič, who is handing over to Miodrag Đorđević today.

Yet to be implemented is higher pay as one of the key conditions for the independence of judges, construction of a new court house in Ljubljana, and a reform of the justice system to have the district court as the basic organisational first-instance unit, he said.

Similarly, incoming Supreme Court President Đorđević thinks courts are in good shape, but there are things that could be further improved.

Đorđević, who was appointed by parliament in January, thus intends to give a special emphasis on the Supreme Court as the highest-instance court during his term.

He will advocate for the appointment of judges to be transferred from parliament onto the Judicial Council, and for the Supreme Court president's appointment to be entrusted to Supreme Court judges and for him or her to be sworn in before the president of Slovenia.

Just like Florjančič, he urged ""adequate and decent"" pay for judges, saying that in this field the views of judges are not taken into account.

He will make an effort to address the shortage of staff while also overhauling the career system, and to involve judges in legislative procedures.

Judges were also addressed by Slovenian President Nataša Pirc Musar, who said that the current times were hard for the judiciary.

""It seems that various stakeholders too often overlook you as one of the branches of power,"" she said.

Pirc Musar also took issue with the justice system being labelled by some of its critics ""the injustice system"" to fuel a fundamental distrust in it.

She believes this is done by those political players who want to sow divisions while it also shows that they do not understand ""your work and mission"".

Despite the issues, the president believes that the situation is not as bleak as it may seen and could soon turn for the better.

Parliamentary Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič, a former judge, said that judges have long been faced with inadequate premises, low pay, and slow digitalisation, adding that the National Assembly played a major role in addressing them.","crime, law and justice"
Dnevnik says police going through turbulent times,"The Slovenian police force has so far not had much luck with stability. So far, not a single police commissioner since independence has served a full term and the last three years were particularly turbulent for the police, Dnevnik says on Friday.","Aleš Hojs, who served as interior minister in the previous government, replaced as many as three police commissioners, who were more or less the extended hand of the ruling politicians, and thus completely destroyed the stability of the police force.

The arrival of Tatjana Bobnar at the helm of the Interior Ministry and Boštjan Lindav at the helm of police thus seemed as a shift towards normality, but it turned out to be a very brief one.

Last autumn serious frictions started between the closest aides of PM Robert Golob and the senior officials at the ministry and police. Allegedly, the frictions were caused by Golob's informal security consultant Miloš Njegoslav Milović, while the part of the team that joined Golob's Freedom Movement from the Marjan Šarec List (LMŠ) did not like Bobnar from the start.

It was telling that Defence Minister Marjan Šarec and Boštjan Poklukar were the loudest to defend Golob in the dispute with Bobnar over political pressure.

But this is not surprising, as Poklukar too had been in conflict with Bobnar before, because she refused to dismiss the head of the Trade Union of Slovenian Police at his order when he served as minister in the Šarec government.

What followed at the time was - as witnesses put it - a foremost comical attempt of brainwashing the wider police leadership at the Gotenica training centre led by Poklukar and Šarec, who was prime minister at the time, and Damir Črnčec.

""The developments in recent days and months do not raise hope for more stability in the police force. Poklukar, who again took over at the helm of the Interior Ministry, is considered a loyal employee who will have no problem demanding that police fulfil the wishes of the prime minister and his close associates.""

What is crucial is how cooperative acting Police Commissioner Senad Jušić will be. He is a rather unanimous senior police councillor from the general police administration without notable managerial experience, who used to closely cooperate with Darko Muženič, director of the NBI.

But if necessary there is always the option of training at Gotenica, Dnevnik says in the commentary Returning to Gotenica.","crime, law and justice"
Golob vows support to Slovenian minority in Austria,"Together with Minister for Slovenians Abroad Matej Arčon, Prime Minister Robert Golob received representatives of the Slovenian minority in Austria on Tuesday. He pledged Slovenia's consistent support for the minority in efforts to fully implement the community's rights guaranteed under Article 7 of the Austrian State Treaty.","The prime minister stressed the importance of education in the Slovenian language for the minority's continued existence and development. He called for the implementation of the bilingual judiciary reform in Austria's Carinthia as soon as possible.

The minority's representatives, who have contributed to efforts to draw up the reform, told Golob about the negative impact of Austria's temporary border controls, which have been in place since 2015.

The representatives noted the minority's efforts to ensure quality education in Slovenian from kindergarten to university and the issue of bilingual judiciary, the government said on its website.

In a report released on Tuesday, the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages called on Austria to strengthen the use of Slovenian in courts and in education, particularly pre-school education.","crime, law and justice"
"SDS wants explanations over Golob's statement about ""Janšists""","The opposition Democrats (SDS) reacted strongly on Wednesday to Prime Minister Robert Golob's statement that he had given former interior minister ""a single task, to rid the police force of Janšists"". The party's MEP Milan Zver asked the European Commission to defend the rule of law in Slovenia.","Golob made the statement after former minister Tatjana Bobnar testified in parliament on Monday that the PM had exerted staffing-related pressure before she resigned. Golob added they had discussed this with Bobnar before she was appointed.

The statement, supposedly referring to police personnel considered loyal to SDS head Janez Janša who preceded Golob as prime minister, has prompted SDS MP Žan Mahnič to ask the government to comment on whether the PM has overstepped his powers.

Given that Golob claims there are ""Janšists"" in the police force ""and that he obviously knows who they are"", Mahnič - who served as state secretary for national security in Janša's office under the previous government - wants the government to provide a list of those belonging on this list according to Golob.

SDS MEP Zver meanwhile wants the European Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, to explain how it will defend the rule of law and victims in Slovenia in the face of the prime minister's public acknowledgement of blatant discrimination on the basis of political beliefs.

The fellow opposition New Slovenia (NSi) already announced on Tuesday a session of the parliamentary Commission for the Oversight of Intelligence and Security Services to look into Golob's alleged efforts to influence staffing in the police force and his potential undermining of national security.

According to unofficial information, Bobnar stated during a segment of Monday's hearing in parliament closed for the public that she had been notified, while still minister, that Golob had personally appealed in 2022 that the arrest of two detected Russian spies be postponed from November to 5 December.

The alleged reason was that the affair coincided with the 27 November tipple referendum, in which voters ended up rejecting the SDS's effort to overturn three government laws.","crime, law and justice"
Former Slovenian Olympian pleads guilty in US for bank fraud,"Slovenian Luka Klasinc, a 50-year-old former figure skater turned businessman, has pleaded guilty to bank fraud related to loans meant for small business owners struggling during the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, newspaper Slovenske Novice reported.","The federal prosecutor's office charged him with bank fraud and identity fraud in attempting to acquire more than US$1.5 million in loans, mainly non-refundable aid, from the American treasury department for his company that organised events related to ice sports worldwide.

Under US law, the former member of the Yugoslav Olympic team in men's individual figure skating, could be jailed for up to 30 years. He is to be sentenced in May.

In the 2021 indictment, Manhattan federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss said Klasinc attempted to secure almost US$1.6 million in loans for his company BOB77, which he then transferred to bank accounts in Mexico, India, and China.

The charges state that Klasinc's company opened three business accounts in 2019 and secured eleven loans between July and September 2020.

His accounts were already frozen in September 2020 due to suspicious transactions which he tried to justify as payments to his business partners and equipment suppliers.

Klasinc allegedly then tried to counterfeit a letter from the Small Business Administration to persuade the unnamed bank to unfreeze his accounts, according to the prosecution.

At the end of May 2021, he came to the US from Istanbul and made three visits to the bank, trying to persuade bank officials that the transactions were meant as investments and had nothing to to with Covid loans. Bank officials reported him to the FBI and he was arrested before boarding a plane back to Turkey.

A month after the arrest, he denied any wrongdoing at a court hearing. Klasinc's American friend and coach Bob Knox offered one million in bail to have him released from prison, Slovenske Novice cited the online portal Law360.

In November 2021, New york federal judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ordered Klasinc be released from custody, but all of his documents were seized and he was put under house arrest.","crime, law and justice"
Slovenia among interveners in Ukraine v. Russia case before ICJ,"Slovenia is participating in the oral hearing in the proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case Ukraine v. Russia as one of the 32 interveners. This places Slovenia ""in the circle of countries that advocate respect for international law and accept international obligations"", the Foreign Ministry said.","The announcement on Wednesday comes as a public sitting was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague as Ukraine has initiated proceedings against Russia before the ICJ for alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

In the case, Kyiv accuses Moscow of trying to justify the invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022, with allegedly false accusations of genocide in eastern Ukraine.

As the proceedings are being attended by 32 intervenor countries, Slovenia's position was presented today at the oral hearing, which runs until 27 September, by Marko Rakovec, the head of the Directorate for International Law and Protection of Interests.

Rakovec noted the integrity of the operation of the ICJ, the fulfilment of contractual obligations in good faith and respect for the importance of the Genocide Convention, the Foreign Ministry said.

The verdict is expected at the beginning of next year, when the terms of five judges will expire. It will be important especially from the aspect of assessing the importance of the roles of interveners to the content of the dispute and the final verdict, it added.

The ICJ was established after the Second World War to resolve disputes between the UN member states when they cannot resolve them themselves. The court's decisions are binding, but it cannot force countries to respect them.

The government decided to submit Slovenia's intervention in the proceedings in November last year, and it formally submitted its statement of intervention before the ICJ in December.","crime, law and justice"
PM warns against hate speech at WWII commemoration,"Prime Minister Robert Golob underlined that history must not be abused for hate speech, as he laid a wreath on Monday at a monument commemorating 77 partisans who fell near the village of Orle just before the end of World War II in what was the final push to liberate the Nazi-occupied Ljubljana.","He urged courage ""in fighting for the right values and the right freedom,"" as he addressed the event marking the 78th anniversary of the battle in which the partisans defeated the Nazi forces four hours after Germany signed the capitulation document.

""We are here today to commemorate the anniversary of the battle to liberate this hero city. The victims who have fallen on this day are so important in their symbolism that they must never be forgotten. Today, we remember the suffering of the entire city.""

Ljubljana was the only capital in Europe that had been turned into a concentration camp during the war, said Golob, referring to the barbed-wire fence encircling the entire city. This must never be forgotten, he said.

""Therefore the victims who lost their lives on the penultimate day of war are so important. The battles in Orle were hard, some say they were the hardest,"" the prime minister said.

The Yugoslav resistance movement was the only internationally-recognised allied force, which is something the losers of World War II are still unable to accept, said Golob. ""This is something we have to talk about as well, because history must not be forgotten.""

Moreover, ""history must not be abused for hate speech. In parliament, preparations are underway to make significant changes in this field. I'm confident that the Freedom Movement and the coalition will find the way to honour history and say no to hate speech once and for all.""

The commemoration was also addressed by Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković and was attended by Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan.","unrest, conflicts and war"
PM Golob advises caution in potential sanctions against Serbia,Prime Minister Robert Golob called for caution in potentially passing sanctions against Serbia after a recent attack in Kosovo as he arrived at the meeting of the European Political Community in Granada. Golob believes that sanctions would not necessarily lead to a long-term solution but Slovenia would join in if the EU had a united position.,"EU heads of states and governments have not yet discussed potential sanctions, said Golob. ""I believe we have to be careful, consistent and insistent,"" he said.

The situation should be diffused and a long-term solution sought, said the prime minister, who does not believe that sanctions alone will lead to a long-term solution.

""If needed and if a united position will be formed, Slovenia will join in,"" Golob said, adding that sanctions did not have to be the first and only step.

The latest events in Kosovo, where a Kosovo police officer and three Serbian attackers were killed in a terrorist attack and subsequent fights, are reprehensible, said Golob, adding that it was right that the international community condemned the individuals that had incited the escalation of events.

He sees a solution in a repeated election in four mostly Serbian municipalities in the north of Kosovo. Golob invited everyone, including the Kosovo Serbs, to participate in the elections to help elect legitimate authorities.

The EU already passed measures against the Kosovo authorities in June for not having done enough to diffuse the tensions in the north of Kosovo.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Slovenia and Cyprus sign defence cooperation agreement,"Defence Minister Marjan Šarec signed a defence cooperation agreement with his Cypriot counterpart Charalambos Petrides as he visited Nicosia on Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence announced on Twitter.","""Minister Petrides and I agreed on tangible steps for cooperation between the militaries of the two countries, in particular in the areas of military exercises and training, research and development, cyber security and EU initiatives,"" Šarec said.

At the signing, Šarec moreover underlined that, in the context of rapid developments in defence and security, it is increasingly important to strengthen cooperation between countries.

""With the signing of the agreement, we have established principles and procedures for expanding political-military cooperation between Slovenia and Cyprus,"" he added.

The bilateral talks also touched focus on the current security situation in the Western Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, the war in Ukraine, international operations and missions, and topical European issues.

Šarec pointed out that Slovenia supports a more ambitious and effective Common Security and Defence Policy. ""We believe that the EU has taken important steps to strengthen European defence capabilities and promote a safer and more resilient EU environment,"" he added.

The minister sees participation in operations and missions as a key part of contributing to international security and stabilisation efforts. He added that the Western Balkans remains a priority operational area for Slovenia, while Slovenia is also actively engaged in the Mediterranean, the Sahel and the Middle East.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Delo comments on EU in face of Israel-Palestinian war,"The newspaper Delo examines in its front-page commentary on Friday how the EU is dealing in the face of the war in Israel, saying the bloc has found itself in a yet new dimension of a geopolitical crisis. In contrast to the war in Ukraine, where the EU's response was united, the conflict in the Middle East has sent the bloc on a slippery slope.","EU member states have different histories with this conflict and different approaches to it, the paper says.

Ireland and Spain are quick to side with the Palestinians, while Germany's historic burden means the country does not really know ""how to fill up its maxim on Israel's safety as its raison d'état with content"", and Hungary is adamant in its defence of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In the shadow of the US, the EU is just a net contributor at best, providing by far the most development and humanitarian aid for the Palestinians. But it also gets to feel the direct consequences of the war and destabilisation in the region as refugees flock to its borders.

Its divisions make it impossible for the EU to have significant influence on the international stage, says the paper, describing how hard it was for member states to negotiate the wording for a humanitarian ceasefire for the ongoing summit.

The question of how far Israel may go in its attacks on Hamas's infrastructure is another issue on which member states are divided. It must not be considered normal that Israel should not take civilian casualties into consideration, but Hamas's tactics are holding Palestinian civilians hostage.

The war is to get worse and for the EU it is especially problematic that it is intertwined with migrations and fear of terrorism, resulting in ever more controls on internal borders, the paper says under the headline Drums of War Echoing Across Europe.

The EU sees relaunching the peace process for a two-state solution as a beacon of hope. ""But there is still a long way to go before the drums of war die out.""","unrest, conflicts and war"
Večer says Ukraine's counter-offensive taking small steps,"The Ukrainian counter-offensive, thought to have been under way since 6 June, has disappointed those who expected a spectacle that would lead to a rapid end of the war, the newspaper Večer says on Tuesday.","""The first days of the offensive, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed while meeting Canadian PM Justin Trudeau on Saturday, are all about examining the enemy, about small steps, when media label each liberated small village a big success,"" reads the commentary Offensive of Small Steps.

The front line is more than a thousand kilometres long, so the goal is not clear at all. Some analysts say it is winning back the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while others think it is to get through Zaporizhzhia to the Sea of Azov and thus isolate the Crimea peninsula, which Russia annexed more than nine years ago.

Not even the greatest optimists believe that the Ukrainian army, although trained and equipped in the West, could end the war with one swing. But the fact is that Zelensky had to start the offensive even though he seemed to have delayed it somewhat.

On the one hand he was forced into it by the high expectations of the Ukrainian people, tired of the war, and on the other probably also by his military and political sponsors in the West, which also feel the pressure of their voters given the billions of dollars invested in the war, the paper says.

The initial political unity has also been slowly cracking, Večer says, pointing to Hungary and Greece only in the EU.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been quiet for now, waiting. ""We will know that Russian troops are truly in trouble when he pulls his strongest trump card again, the threat with nuclear weapons. Which he does every time things do not go according to his plans.""

A defeat is not an option for either Ukraine or Russia and a full military victory is virtually impossible, so this counter-offensive might only create a new, different staring point for negotiations, which nobody is talking about yet, Večer says.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Paper says Putin to end up loser,"The newspaper Večer fears that Russia could start war in Moldova, where the situation is becoming tense due to Transdniestria, one of Russia's many satellites in the area of the former Soviet Union. No matter how many wars President Vladimir Putin would start, he is sure to be the ""loser of his own bloody reality show"".","Nobody can see any proper reason why Putin would need another war, but the same was true for the war in Ukraine, says Saturday's commentary under the headline All of Putin's Fronts.

""The only reason is the Russian president himself."" He has in his hands a few more territories where he could provoke a war any time, including Abkhasia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh.

The Russian army also helps Syrian President Al Assad and the Western Balkans, Russian intelligence services are very active in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Kosovo, while Serbia's friendship with Russia is so open that no pressure from the US or EU would persuade President Vučić from turning against Russia.

The problem is that Putin has nothing to lose. With few exceptions, such as China and Belarus, he is already isolated in the international community. He can of course start another war or two, destabilising a certain region or even the world, ""but he is in fact a foregone loser of his own bloody reality show"".

The Russian nation is to decide on his political fate in elections in a year. Even if surprises such as his fall from power are not (yet) possible, he is on a steep downward trajectory. ""The only question is how many victims he will drag with him into the abyss.""","unrest, conflicts and war"
Delo says everything leads to Ukraine becoming part of Europe,"Commenting on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attending the latest EU summit in Brussels, Delo says in Friday's front-page commentary that the EU faces difficult decisions that will ultimately lead to Ukraine becoming an integral part of the integration project in Europe.","The message from the summit was clear - the future of Ukraine is in the EU. It has become apparent during the Russian invasion how close the pursuit of values such as freedom, democracy and peace is to Europeans, the newspaper says.

Regardless of Zelensky's rhetoric, the EU is cautious when it comes to promises, as it is obvious that Ukraine will not be able to become a full EU member state for a long time, Delo adds under the headline At Home in Europe.

""But the vision of joining the EU must remain a guideline. This motivates Ukraine both in defending the country against Russian aggression and in adopting reforms.""

In the short term, the EU must make sure, together with Canada, the US and others, that Ukraine gets better armament and survives within its borders.

Russia obviously bets on a long war and expects that the support for Ukraine in Europe will start to break, but this has so far showed to be a wrong strategy, like many others invented by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Delo notes that in order for Moscow to be ready for serious peace talks, it must first experience a major defeat on the battlefield, as history shows that dictators like Putin are not stopped by being given concessions.

""In the process of establishing peace, it is also the EU that has to go through difficult realisations and decisions that will eventually lead to Ukraine becoming an inseparable part of the integration project on the old continent.""

For starters, the celebration of the modest, but almost star-like treatment of Zelensky in Brussels is a symbol of the EU recognising that Ukraine is at home in Europe, concludes the commentary.","unrest, conflicts and war"
FM Fajon urges humanitarian ceasefire in Middle East (adds),"Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon has urged a humanitarian ceasefire in the Middle East to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. As she arrived at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, Fajon also stressed that efforts should be made to prevent the conflict from spreading through the region.","""We're deeply concerned over the humanitarian crisis in Palestine. We're following with great concern the closure of hospitals, shortage of water and shortage of food. We are calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, for opening humanitarian corridors and supplying civilians with humanitarian aid,"" said Fajon.

The minister believes that such a ceasefire could reduce the risk of the conflict spreading through the region.

""We must act in line with international law, humanitarian law and do everything for the conflict not to spread. So we are calling on everyone to refrain from further violence and from killing innocent civilians.""

Fajon stressed that Slovenia supports Israel's right to self-defence, where the country must act in a proportionate manner, as a determined military attack could have serious consequences and cause numerous civilian casualties.

At the same time, Slovenia supports all efforts for peace in the Middle East that would be based on a two-state solution, Fajon also said.

A similar statement was issued by the United Nations Association of Slovenia on Monday, which stressed the role of a peaceful diplomatic solution for sustainable peace in the Middle East, while supporting UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres's appeal for a ceasefire and for starting talks.

The talks are necessary ""to prevent the potential spread of the war across the entire region and the potential scenario of the war turning into an armed geopolitical conflict of superpowers"", the association wrote.

It also supported Guterres's appeal to open humanitarian corridors and deliver humanitarian aid to all civilians trapped in the Gaza Strip.

While condemning Hamas's terror attack on Israel, it warned that Israel's right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charters has its limits in international law.

The conflict that started on 7 October has claimed 1,400 lives in Israel and more than 5,000 among Palestinians, with most of the victims on both sides being civilians.","unrest, conflicts and war"
"Delo says war in Ukraine is another asymmetric, eternal war","Delo says in Thursday's front-page commentary, entitled Another Eternal War in Ukraine, that there is not a single sign that the mass killing as part of the war in Ukraine may end, as the situation is only getting worse.","The newspaper notes that after 9/11, the era of so-called asymmetric wars, characterised by clashes between conventional armies and scattered paramilitary units, began, or rather intensified.

The common denominator of modern asymmetric wars is also that they last for a long time and, while being classified as a conventional war according to military doctrine, the war in Ukraine can conditionally be labelled as an asymmetric war.

This is due to the proportions of the attacking country and the fact that there is no end of it in sight. The latter is not only because of the asymmetry between the warring countries, but mainly because of the absence of functioning international structures.

""Since there is no one who can stop the Russian aggression, the slaughter in Ukraine is intensifying, and the number of victims of the war is rising sharply together with the apathy of the international community,"" Delo says.

The newspaper notes that a large part of eastern and southern Ukraine, where the front line stretches for more than a thousand kilometres, is completely destroyed and the natural environment is devastated.

Even in peace, the area is unfit for life, as the constant, violent artillery bombardment has completely changed the landscape in line with the scorched-earth policy.

""There is not a single sign that the mass killing in Eastern Europe may end. On the contrary,"" concludes the commentary.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Dnevnik says US-China talks revealed complexity of relations,"Commenting on the talks between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the top three Chinese officials in Beijing, the newspaper Dnevnik says on Wednesday that the mere fact that the talks lasted about 11 hours confirms the severity of the problems between the old and new superpower.","The outcome, given the length of the debates, is rather modest and general: stabilisation of relations, strengthening of communications (not all of them, as China rejects military ones) and cooperation in areas of common interest.

""Obviously, it is a minimum that has brought some relief to the region and is welcome and necessary because of the turbulent period that has been lasting since Trump's trade war and has continued with the escalation around Taiwan, the Chinese balloon, and the maritime and air incidents in East Asia.""

The talks released some tensions but also indicated that no notable improvement in relations could be expected any time soon. Statements after the meetings suggest that it is not even expected by either side. The challenge is how to deal with the differences to prevent a full-blown conflict that would affect the global economy.

The US turned to East Asia under Obama, but under both subsequent presidents the attitude to Beijing have become sterner. China sees US policies as an attempt at restricting its economic and general development.

If the economy seems to be one of the main concerns, and its well-being is connected to the absence of tensions, this is good news. But in the long-term the situation is slightly foggier, the paper says, pointing to the Taiwan issue.

""Beijing has made it clear that it sees it as an internal issue, where there is no room for compromise, and that the US should stay out of it. It is also clearly trying to hold up a mirror to the US by stepping up its espionage and military activities in Cuba.

""The US will not withdraw, not because it is bound by law to help the island, but because Taiwan is strategically located in the backyard of China, whose ambitions in controlling of sea routes the US also wants to restrict,"" Dnevnik says under the headline Managing Lasting Differences.","unrest, conflicts and war"
"Europe unprincipled due to war-related interests, Mladina says","The magazine Mladina praises Europe for its values and principles in Friday's editorial, but regrets that the war in Ukraine has made it put these values and principles on hold to pursue ""higher interests"" stemming from the war.","Crises and wars are always a time for change that seemed unimaginable in peace, which is also true for the war in Ukraine. Tectonic shifts are taking place because of it or in its backgrounds, and once it is over ""we will wake up in a different international situation"", politically, economically and in terms of alliances.

Europe, its institutions and individual countries act in this war from the position of a moral authority defending their common values, which Mladina says is the purest position possible and a glue keeping Europe together.

However, Mladina regrets that Europe is not consistent - because of the war in Ukraine, it has suddenly forgotten about other problems in Europe and the broader region, with Poland and Hungary remaining autocratic states and Turkey a totalitarian state.

In these cases, Europe has detoured from its principles because of higher interests, which automatically makes its position ""untrustworthy"", not only in the eyes of other autocrats such as Putin and its own residents but also other international players, who in turn pursue their own interests, Mladina says under the headline Interests.

European countries and institutions act in a confused way, without a clear focus, with interests often overpowering principles, which can also be seen in European climate policy, with the EU pursing for phasing out fossil fuels by 2035 while Germany has started blocking the process.

Europe is different from the rest of the world and undoubtedly better because of its principles, commitment to the law and its freethinking spirit.

Without such Europe and the EU, Slovenia would have remained under Janez Janša's authoritarian regime, while Poland, Hungary and many other places in Europe would be much worse off today. Without Europe and the EU, peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have been maintained, but Mladina says ""this is simply no longer enough"".","unrest, conflicts and war"
Golob and two ministers attending NATO summit,"PM Robert Golob will attend a two-day NATO summit that starts in Lithuania on Tuesday and focuses on bringing Ukraine closer to NATO. His delegation will also feature Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and Defence Minister Marjan Šarec. As part of the summit, the NATO-Ukraine Council will hold its first meeting.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to take the opportunity of the NATO-Ukraine meeting to urge the allies to invite Ukraine into NATO, and the summit is expected to confirm that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance.

Golob said on the sidelines of an EU summit at the end of June that one of the conditions for the launch of talks on Ukraine's NATO membership was lasting peace in Ukraine. He said there was no doubt that Ukraine was on the Euro-Atlantic path.

An issue in the debate on Ukraine's NATO membership is how to ensure that Russia does not simply take a break and then attack its neighbour again, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last Friday. He welcomed the consultations of individual allies with Kyiv on security guarantees at bilateral level.

The Slovenian Foreign Ministry has told the STA that Slovenia does not intend to participate in providing bilateral or multilateral security guarantees to Ukraine until it joins NATO. ""Slovenia remains committed to assisting Ukraine in all respects to the best of its ability, as it has done so far,"" the ministry wrote.

In the light of Russian aggression against Ukraine, Stoltenberg announced that NATO leaders would endorse a new defence spending commitment, under which 2% of GDP would be the lower limit and no longer the upper limit for defence spending.

This year, 11 of the 31 members will spend 2% of GDP or more on defence, and next year this number will increase significantly, Stoltenberg said. Slovenia will spend 1.35% of GDP on defence this year, according to NATO's estimates.

According to the resolution on the long-term development and equipping of the Slovenian Armed Forces, endorsed by the National Assembly in March, defence spending is to increase to 2% by 2030.

During the part of the meeting dedicated to strengthening NATO's defence and deterrence posture, the leaders are also expected to approve new regional defence plans today. The plans for NATO's northern, central, and southern regions, which also include Slovenia, envisage having 300,000 NATO troops on high alert.

The second day of the summit will be partly dedicated to talks with the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, as well as the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, respectively.

Apart from Golob, the Slovenian delegation will include Foreign Minister Fajon and Defence Minister Šarec, who will take part in meetings with their counterparts.

On the sidelines of the summit, Golob will meet Finish President Sauli Niinistö today and Fajon will meet her Romanian counterpart Bogdan Aurescu.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Catholic Church hosting meeting of Balkan religious leaders,"A two-day meeting of religious leaders from the Balkans will be held in the coastal town of Koper this weekend.

At a time when Europe is facing the threat of war, this is an important initiative, the Bishops' Conference stressed.

""If there is peace in the Balkans, Europe too can look forward to more stability and peace,"" said Bishop Peter Štumpf, chair of the organising committee, as he presented the meeting earlier this month.

The religious leaders who will gather in Koper, he said, ""have a great spiritual and moral influence on what is happening and what will happen in the Balkans"".

A Youth for Peace cultural meeting will also be held in Koper, and in the evening a gala organ concert at the Koper cathedral.","unrest, conflicts and war"
President echoes UN demands for end of invasion in Ukraine,"President Nataša Pirc Musar agreed with demands urging Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine during the UN Security Council's open debate in New York on Wednesday. She believes that justice must be served to achieve peace in the long-term, which includes punishments for those responsible.","Slovenia condemns the Russian aggression against Ukraine, an aggression that has multiple consequences - in addition to the most direct effect on the Ukrainian nation, it also affects international relations in the region and the world, and food safety, she said.

The war in Ukraine must be placed in a wider context, she pointed out, noting that the number of conflict deaths had increased by 97% last year. ""It was the deadliest year in nearly 30 years.""

According to her, the war in Ukraine contributed the most to this increase, however it was one of the 55 conflicts worldwide in 2022, and all of them are important and demand attention, Pirc Musar added.

""A lasting peace can only be achieved if justice is guaranteed,"" and Slovenia strongly supports the fight against impunity, since all those responsible for crimes and atrocities should be held accountable.

Pointing to the adoption of the Ljubljana-Hague convention, which will enable international cooperation in investigation and prosecution of the worst crimes, she called on all countries to become parties to the convention.

It is her belief that the UN Charter and multilateralism based on international law are increasingly under threat.

""For global governance to work, we need an inclusive, transparent, responsive and responsible multilateral system based on trust, respect, solidarity and international law, with the United Nations and the UN Security Council at its core,"" she said, reiterating her call for the council's reform.

The great powers should be the ones who make and keep the peace, and they should also refrain from breaching it, she stressed. ""This is the point from which any sensible reform of the Security Council should start. Slovenia will support such endeavours and take part in them,"" the president vowed.

""If we want a better and more just world, we need a better and more just UN and Security Council.""

The meeting of the Security Council to discuss the situation in Ukraine was held on the sidelines of the 78th session of the UN General Assembly. It saw many heads of state and government and other senior officials take the floor, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.","unrest, conflicts and war"

It notes that the nationalists have been using this fear to arouse a sense of threat among the German-speaking majority. ""This diabolic formula ... has led to divisions, hatred, conflict and wars so many times. Yet people will still fall for it.""

Carinthia Social Democrat Governor Peter Kaiser likes to say that he has managed to improve the atmosphere in the province, the paper writes, quoting Carinthian Slovenian Gregor Wakounig in saying that this is but an appearance.

""The old three-party pact in Carinthia has for decades prevented implementation of the Carinthian Slovenians' rights. Parties have not made any self-reflection, let alone repaired the damage done.

Dnevnik says thousands dying before Fortress Europe,"The newspaper Dnevnik says in Never Again? on Saturday that after a ship carrying 500 migrants sunk in 2013 in what was one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, shipwrecks are still happening, while EU politicians shift the responsibility for their deaths to smugglers rather than to EU border authorities.","""Over the years, Fortress Europe has become a worn-out term, but it is still accurate. If you flee countries where poverty, hunger and war reign, you will not get to Europe in a nice way.""

There are no safe routes for refugees, with the exception of those from Ukraine. Visas are reserved for the privileged. EU border services are mostly picking up from the seas and rivers those who almost drown. If they do drown, it is considered to be their own fault or bad luck, says the paper.

A few days ago a new agreement was reached in Brussels on the distribution of asylum seekers among EU countries, but many countries are still resisting it.

Dnevnik says that the deal may be adopted before the European elections in a year's time, but even if it is, it ""will only apply to those who make it to EU territory"" alive.","unrest, conflicts and war"
"Minister promoting Slovenia's UN bid in New York, upbeat about the vote","Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon continues her visit to New York to commemorate the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. After addressing the 11th session of the UN General Assembly on the subject, she continued to lobby for Slovenia's candidacy for the UN Security Council, counting on a good result.","""This is an extraordinary session held on the anniversary of the war in Ukraine and the Euro-Atlantic part of the participants in particular strongly condemn the Russian aggression, all the civilian casualties, the destruction of civilian infrastructure. They condemn the war and offer assistance to Ukraine. I also condemned the Russian aggression in the clearest possible terms and said that Slovenia will help Ukraine as long as necessary,"" Fajon told Slovenian reporters in New York.

""At the same time, we support all those countries that are working for a lasting and just peace, without forgetting other parts of the world,"" she said, adding that this was often a criticism that Europeans faced in debates - ""that we are too focused on the war that is happening on our soil, while forgetting what is happening elsewhere in the world.""

""I said that we care and I am presenting Slovenia in this light as we seek a seat on the Security Council. That Slovenia will know how to listen to all those struggling with challenges such as climate change, energy and food security and others,"" she said.

Slovenia has the support of European and Western countries ahead of the 2024-2025 Security Council elections, but the UN General Assembly has 193 members and 129 votes will be needed for election. Asked how she responds to criticism that Europe is obsessed with Ukraine, the minister said she was being open about it.

""The fact is that this war is much closer to us than to other parts of the world and our counterparts need to understand that. Our security risks are much higher. But Slovenia knows how to listen to other parts of the world. We are a small country and there are more than 100 such countries in the UN and we can better defend their interests.""

Fajon said she was presenting Slovenia as a green country that is striving for clean water, fighting climate change, putting a lot of energy into renewables, and at the same time defending human rights, gender equality, fighting discrimination, helping women also in peace processes, defending peace and security in the world. She also highlights science and research. ""We have courage and we have knowledge.""

The minister said she had not heard any criticism about Slovenia deciding for the UN candidacy too late, after Belarus, and not at its own initiative. There is also no indication that any other country from the Eastern Europe would present a bid at the last minute to apply for a seat. ""The energy is good, the team is working well, I am counting on a good result"", she said about the elections to be held on 6 June.

While saying she did not want to prejudge the outcome of the vote in the Council, which had become very complex and fragmented, she noted that every vote in the General Assembly was an indication of the balance of power. All the resolutions condemning the war in Ukraine and demanding the withdrawal of the Russian army have been supported by a majority of UN members, she said.

According to Fajon, the different views on how the crisis should be solved within Slovenia do not harm the candidacy. ""The political messages ... are clear. The public is not divided. There are, of course, letters from various intellectuals, which to me is a reflection of democracy, where every opinion counts. But as foreign minister, I would have liked to see this terrible war not being manipulated with"", she said, adding it was very clear who is the aggressor and who is the victim.

The minister is scheduled to meet her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, her Georgian counterpart Ilia Darchiashvili and Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey during her stay. She will also attend a dinner featuring EU ministers and their G7 counterparts. She leaves for home on Friday.","unrest, conflicts and war"
Government to allocate EUR 150m for sports infrastructure,"The government adopted on Thursday the investment programme for sports infrastructure for the next five years, worth EUR 150 million.

The support plan is based on the investments proposal for the 2023-2027 period, drafted under the previous government, he added.

""The programme prioritises sports training facilities and outdoor sports grounds, free of charge for all residents,"" the minister said. Funds for this year's open call for applications will total just under EUR 11 million, of which EUR 8 million will be allocated to multi-purpose halls and gyms and EUR 2.9 million for outdoor sports facilities.

""I felt good yeah, it was a hot day again and our guys had everything under control during the whole day and at the end, it was just full gas up [the final climb],"" the Slovenian said.

This is Roglič's 76th win after he claimed three stage wins in the race. The feat bodes well for his upcoming appearance in the Vuelta a Espana, which will start next Saturday.

Vlatko Čančar celebrates NBA title in Koper,"Vlatko Čančar, who recently won the title of NBA champion with the Denver Nuggets, celebrated the accomplishment in his home town of Koper on Tuesday. The reception was naturally much smaller than the Nuggets championship parade through Denver, but it did not lack enthusiasm.","Received by hundreds of locals, the 26-year-old player said that it still seems like a dream that he has become only the fourth Slovenian to have won a championship ring.

""If someone had told me back then, when I was playing on concrete courts in front of the block of flats in Koper, that I was going to be an NBA champion, I would probably have laughed at them, especially since I preferred to play football back then,"" he told the press.

Čančar has been getting limited play in the League, but last season was his busiest, with 60 regular season games played and almost 15 minutes played per game on average. He took advantage of this, averaging five points per game, and also made some beautiful, attention-drawing plays.

Asked about what it is like to play with Serb Nikola Jokić, a two-time NBA MVP and this year's Finals MVP, he gave a big smile and a short-and-sweet answer: ""I've never had an easier job.""

Ljubljana getting ready for world's first official water volleyball tournament,"Ljubljana will host the world's first ever official water volleyball tournament on 12 and 13 August.

Pelješac Bridge chief designer is Delo's person of the year,"Marjan Pipenbaher, the chief designer of the Pelješac Bridge in Croatia, has been declared the person of the year by the newspaper Delo, which noted that Pipenbaher is one of the most renowned European bridge builders and designers.","Delo's person of the year was announced at a ceremony in Ljubljana on Thursday evening, addressed by UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin, the last year's winner of the title.

The editorial board of Delo said on the occasion that Pipenbaher was the chief designer of more than 200 bridges and viaducts in Slovenia and abroad.

One of his latest and finest works is the Pelješac Bridge, which opened in July 2022 to provide a road link from the south-eastern Croatian semi-exclave to the rest of the country.

Being one of the five largest bridges in Europe built in the 21st century, the 2,404-metre long structure is not only a major engineering accomplishment, it also brings practical advantages for Slovenians holidaying in southern Dalmatia.

The Bridge has significantly shortened the journey from Zagreb to Dubrovnik, and passengers no longer have to cross the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Delo noted in a press release.

Pipenbaher, who is also a lecturer and the founder of a civil engineering design and research company, has received many awards from his peers, including the Kolos award from the Croatian Chamber of Civil Engineers for the Pelješac Bridge.

The chamber said that the bridge, built by China Road and Bridge Corporation, is by far the largest and most complex construction project in Croatia.

Pipenbaher was picked as Delo's person of the year from a number of nominees, including ski jumper Urša Bogataj, entrepreneur Ivo Boscarol, astrophysicist Maruša Bradač, Prime Minister Robert Golob, the NGO 8th March Institute and President Nataša Pirc Musar.

New vote to be held for sports and culture rep in upper chamber,"A new election will be held to appoint the representative for culture and sports in the upper chamber of parliament, after the Constitutional Court voided the appointment of Tomaž Horvat, who won the post in the November election. The National Electoral Commission will be deciding about calling a new vote on Thursday.","The Constitutional Court found that Horvat's candidacy was unlawful because he did not meet a legal requirement and therefore cannot be a member of the National Council. The vote was challenged by the culture NGO Asociacija.

Having been nominated by the Slovenian Football Association, the Association of Football Coaches and the Association of Football Referees, Horvat is performing his sports-related duties in his spare time and not professionally, which disqualifies his candidacy.

Information held by the Electoral Commission shows that Horvat is a financial inspector, the Constitutional Court has said.

The court only voided the final stage of the vote, and not the two preceding phases: the appointment of electors and the candidacy procedure. This means that the other four candidates for the spot will be on the ballot.

The National Electoral Commission has to call a new election within eight days after receiving the Constitutional Court's decision and will be discussing the matter on Thursday.",sport

Giant ancient dugout found in Mura after massive floods,The floods that wreaked havoc across Slovenia in early August have led to the discovery of a giant ancient dugout canoe in the north-east of the country. The 11-metre dugout was found on the bank of the Mura River between the villages of Hrastje-Mota and Vučja Vas. Experts say the vessel could date back to the late bronze and iron ages.,"This assumption is made based on the characteristics of the stern and the dugout's size, which correspond to those of the vessels used in Central and Western Europe in the late Bronze Age and Iron Age, when the transport needs increased due to demographic and economic rise in the early first millennium BC.

The dugout was found in mid-September by Ljubomir Zečević, a connoisseur of the natural and cultural heritage of the Prekmurje region. He immediately informed director of the regional museum, archaeologist Branko Kerman, of the find, archaeology institute Skupina Stik said.

The dugout probably surfaced during the massive floods that hit the country in August and has been labelled a spectacular find.

Zečevič, Kerman and a conservator from the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, visited the site to determine that that the canoe was dug out of an oak tree with a hand tool.

The find is said to be spectacular because of the length of the vessel - which is more than 11 metres - and an interesting and rare type of stern, ending in a massive vertical plank inserted into a groove.

The experts say that the original location of the vessel is difficult to determine, but it is almost certain that the floods could not have ripped it out of the nearby plains but that the dugout had probably rested in the sediments of the Mura riverbed upstream from the spot where it was found.

Based on the studies of dugouts of comparable size it could be concluded that this one could carry between nine and 14 persons or a corresponding amount of cargo and a two- to three-member crew.

The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage has ordered the dugout to be transferred to a safe location. Several history and archaeology institutes, including the Archaeology Department of the Faculty of Arts from Ljubljana, will join forces to pull out the vessel this weekend.

The dugout will be secured and fastened to a support platform, on which it will be moved downstream along the Mura to a spot from where it can be lifted. It will then be transported to the Murska Sobota Lake, where it will be stored at the bottom of the lake pending a decision on further conservation procedures, Skupina Stik said.",sport

The same two players arranged the second goal in the 28th minute, when Šporar stole the ball in the middle of the field and completed a long pass towards Šeško, who made it 2:0 with a diagonal shot.

The Finnish defence was firmer in the second half and the score looked settled, but then Erik Janža converted a corner kick into his first goal for the national team.

Ljubljana WTA tournament's city centre court off to bad start,"The only WTA level tennis tournament in Slovenia, which had to be moved to Ljubljana from Portorož this year after its traditional coastal location was sold, got under way on Monday. The event's transition to the capital has been bumpy, with a temporary court conceived for promotional purposes in the city centre proving a bit of a nightmare.","The organisers first planned to set up the temporary court in Congress Square, but failed to obtain consent from the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, which argued that all content that is not on par with the cultural significance of what is a UNESCO World Heritage Site should be avoided.

Strong opposition also came from a number of architects and urban planners, who argued that Congress Square hosting an event that would be able to accommodate about 1,000 visitors in total, visitors belonging to a select segment of society, would entail 280,000 people in Ljubljana needing to change their everyday route.

The location settled on eventually was Republic Square in front of the parliament building, a traditional location of protest rallies and Statehood Day ceremonies, with the first match today featuring first-seeded Slovakian Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and Nigina Abduraimova from Uzbekistan.

The encounter needed to be suspended as the court proved too soft after the first three games of the opening match and moved to Tivoli park, the venue hosting the bulk of the matches of the US$ 115,000 WTA Zavarovalnica Sava Ljubljana tournament.

""The problem was the short time available to make the court fit for play ... We are presently working on making the court harder,"" chief organiser Gregor Krušič told the press, feeling confident the venue will be ready in a day or two.",sport
Slovenians building scenery warehouse for Bavarian State Opera,"The Bavarian State Opera is renovating and expanding its scenery warehouse, with the principal contractor being the Slovenian engineering company Riko, which has also hired a number of other Slovenian companies for the project worth a total of EUR 35 million.","Riko has been awarded the contract to supply and install the steel structure of the entire building, including the roof and facade, and to supply and install special steel storage racks for scenery containers with an automatic control system.

The deal is worth more than EUR 15 million, while the entire project, including the purchase of land and other construction work, is worth EUR 35 million.

Representatives of the government of the state of Bavaria marked the end of the roof construction work at a ceremony on Monday in the town of Poing near Munich, where the renovated and expanded warehouse is located.

Installation work as well as work to connect the new facilities with the existing warehouse system, and integrate and expand the IT system for warehouse management are also under way.

The project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2024, and Riko will also be tasked to maintain the system for four years following its completion.

""Unique stage decorations are being made and stored in Poing, and the extension will make it possible for all opera decorations to be stored in one place,"" he said.

Bernreiter is happy that Slovenian companies participate in the project. ""Economic cooperation between Slovenia and Bavaria is excellent, and such projects are only an upgrade,"" he said.

National team start EURO 2024 qualifiers with high hopes,"The Slovenian men's national football team will start its EURO 2024 qualifying campaign in Kazakhstan today. Wins in Astana and three days later in Ljubljana against San Marino are a must for Slovenia to position themselves among the frontrunners in what, at least on paper, looks like a manageable group.","Seeking their second berth at football euros following the 2000 tournament, Slovenia are playing in Group H, which also features Denmark, Finland and Northern Ireland.

The only major international star that head-coach Matjaž Krek has been able to fall back on is Atletico Madrid's keeper Jan Oblak, but the support of a few more players active abroad, in particular Salzburg's young striker Benjamin Šeško, and some home talent has sufficed for Slovenia to hold on to a spot in division B of the UEFA Nations League in 2022.

""One does not enter a cycle of qualifying matches looking to end up in a solid third or fourth place. There are aspirations and goals based on the Nations League, but it will all be decided on the pitch ... We have to show determination,"" Kek said before assembling the team, adding Slovenia will surely be a force to be reckoned with.

The plan to end up as one of the top 2 teams in the group and make it to Germany in 2024 has been underlined by Slovenian Football Association head Radenko Mijatović, who pointed to the team's more recent results. ""The optimism we express is also based on the fact that the team has been playing together for some time and that it is well managed,"" he added.

The first test for Slovenia, currently 62nd in the FIFA rankings, will be Kazakhstan, ranked 115th. While the underdog features no major names among its ranks, its home advantage will be boosted by the Astana stadium's artificial turf and temperatures of well below freezing point.

While Slovenia, whose heyday goes back to the World Cup in 2010 when it was ranked the 15th strongest team in the world, have never played Kazakhstan, Sunday's match with San Marino will be the sixth against this football minnow, Slovenia having won all five to date.

Slovenian community centre being renovated in Trieste,"After the foundation was laid for returning Slovenian community centres in Trieste to the Slovenian minority with a minority protection law more than two decades ago, one of these centres, National Hall at St John's, should be fully renovated by the end of the year, the newspaper Primorski Dnevnik reports online.","The efforts to renovate the building started 19 years ago, but the actual renovation works started in January 2021, according to the Trieste-based newspaper.

Now, the works on the exterior are to be concluded in the summer months, which is when the National and Study Library and its department of history and ethnography, and the Slovenian Research Institute, which are the main users of the centre, and two other local associations, should be able to start fitting the interior.

These organisations told the press today they expected to be able to move into the new multi-purpose centre at the start of next year. By mid-June, they plan to file a request for funds for the equipment to the regional government of Friuli Venezia Giulia.

According to the head of the Slovenian Research Institute, Devan Jagodic, the ideas for the new centre are ambitious, will pose a big challenge but will also be an investment into new generations that will strengthen the presence of Slovenians not only in the neighbourhood but also in the wider Trieste area.

National Hall at St John's has been picked strategically as the young gather in the area, given that Slovenian schools are near-by and so are a stadium, the seats of various associations and the University of Trieste.

A network of educational, study, sports and recreational centres is to be created in the area, a kind of campus, where potentially some 1,000 young daily visitors could be expected, he said.

Energy poverty rate in Slovenia up to 7.2% last year,"There were around 62,000 or 7.2% of households in Slovenia that met the criteria for energy poverty in 2022, 0.7 percentage points up on the year before. Some 102,000 people lived in such energy-deprived households, shows data from the Statistics Office published on Friday.","In the 2014-2022 period, the share of households that meet the criteria for energy poverty dropped by 26,000 or roughly a third.

Last year the share of such households was the largest among one-person households at 15.1%, irrespective of the age of household members. Comparing households with dependent children, the share was the highest among single-parent households with at least one dependent child.

The share of households experiencing energy poverty was the lowest among households of two adults with two dependent children (2%), among multi-person (at least three persons) households without dependent children (2.2%) and among households of at least three adults with dependent children (2.6%).

Households ranked below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold mainly due to inadequate housing, such as a leaky roof, damp walls and floors, followed by being unable to pay utility bills, and those unable to ensure proper heating.

In the 2014-2022 period, fewer households were exposed to all for constituent elements of energy poverty. The number of households that had overdue utility bills due to financial difficulties declined by almost two thirds, and the share of homes that were financially unable to keep warm almost halved.

The number of those living in inadequate housing conditions dropped by 41% and the share of households below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold by 2%.

Compared to 2021, the number of households below he at-risk-of-poverty threshold and those that could not afford proper heating rose by 1.4 and 1.2 points, respectively.

Paper critical of Davos forum,"The newspaper Primorske Novice says on Tuesday that the world's elite is meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos searching for solutions to various challenges, and while it is good to exchange ideas and views, they will of course find no solutions.","What is more, their behaviour and lifestyle only highlight the injustices of the world we live in, the paper says under the headline Filthy Rich Pretending.

Golob: EU tackling migration issue in source countries,"PM Robert Golob said during questions time in parliament on Monday, as an MP for the opposition Democrats (SDS) raised the issue of migration, that the EU is tackling the issue of migration in source countries and that the ""extreme right"" is scaring people.","SDS MP Anja Bah Žibert said that more than 4,000 illegal crossings of the border had been recorded by police in the first 12 days of September and that most of the migrants were young men. The government has lost control of the situation, she said.

The situation in migrant centres is also chaotic, she added. ""The asylum centre in [Ljubljana's borough of] Vič, which has space for 350 people, today houses over 1,200 migrants, who are moving everywhere and in an uncontrolled way. The police are also pointing this out,"" she said.

At the same time, the number of crimes has increased by almost 60%, making Slovenia a ""paradise for criminal gangs"", Bah Žilbert said. ""All this is a reflection of your open-door policy towards illegal migrants, whom you have literally invited into Slovenia by starting to remove the security fence,"" she said.

The issue of illegal migration is one of the biggest challenges of the EU as a whole, the prime minister said. The EU has a very clear strategy that migration must be dealt with in the countries of origin with which the EU has agreements. Slovenia is fortunate to be a transit country, he added.

Of the 40,000 illegal migrants who have crossed the Slovenian border this year, 24,000 did so in Rigonce, ""where not even a metre of fence has been removed"", according to police data, Golob said. ""I don't know what more proof you need that the fence is not working,"" he added.

Together with Croatia, joint patrols are being conducted, and efforts are under way to expand them to cover wider areas, including in Western Balkan countries. According to Golob, some countries are implementing so-called visa harmonisation, which means that they are allowing ""literally tourist transports of migrants"", who then illegally cross the borders into the Schengen area. An initiative has already been sent to the European Commission on this issue, he said.

""I see that this is a popular topic, especially on the far right, to score points by scaring people,"" Golob said. ""It is not the job of politics to instil fear in people, and I would like you all to become aware of this, including here in parliament,"" he added.

Bah Žibert firmly rejected the claims about scaring people, saying that the ""figures are scary"". She also read a letter of a citizen from Rigonce, describing the situation there as the number of migrants is growing. She proposed that the National Assembly hold a debate on this, a proposal that will be put to a vote on Wednesday.

The SDS also raised the issue of the government not honouring the 30-day deadline for answering MPs' written questions. SDS MP Jelka Godec said that 21 question had not been answered and seven MPs' initiatives had received no reply.

Godec was also bothered by the fact that several ministers were not present during questions time, having sent a last-minute notice. She asked the National Assembly president to demand that ministers give a reason for their absence, which Urška Klakočar Zupančič accepted.",social issue
Issue of poverty among working people raised on poverty day (adds),"On the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, humanitarian organisations in Slovenia warned about poverty among the working population, noting that those who live alone are particularly at risk due to the high costs of living and unregulated housing policy.","This year's day runs under the theme Decent Work and Social Protection: Putting Dignity in Practice, and notes the common goal of the global society is to strive for as few working people as possible to be exposed to the risk of poverty.

Last year, 4.8% of working adults in Slovenia lived below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold. In the last decade, this proportion was lower only in 2019, at 4.5%, shows data from the national Statistics Office.

In Slovenia, this proportion was lower than the EU average in 2022 (8.5%), with Romania (14.5%) and Luxembourg (12.9%) leading the way, and Finland (2.5%) and the Czech Republic (3.4%) having the lowest proportions.

Many older people also find themselves in poverty, especially those with low pensions. Last year, charities provided material aid and helped pay the most important bills for more than 17,600 older people, which is 17% more than the year before.

Added to this should be more than 8,700 households in which people of active age live alone, Slovenian Caritas warns, while the Slovenian Red Cross notes that despite some promising indicators, the number of aid recipients has not decreased.

Among the recipients is a growing number of employees who receive wages that are not sufficient for a decent living, pensioners with low pensions, single-parent families and single-person households.

The organisation notes that it provided help to more than 110,000 individuals with various forms of material aid.

The humanitarian Association of Friends of Youth Ljubljana Moste-Polje meanwhile pointed to the distress of children and families, which is invisible to society while greatly affecting their daily life and children's development.

This places them in a very unequal position compared to their peers, it said, adding that those who work but cannot make ends meet do not feel like an equal part of society, as there is still a strong stigma associated with poverty.

One of the association's humanitarian programmes has involved mainly employed or working people for several years, which means that their income is not sufficient for the basic needs of the family. The share of families where parents work but still struggle reaches up to 65% of all families involved.

""The current policy will not make poverty disappear, it remains among us, so it is up to us as individuals to make a difference in society with solidarity and empathy,"" said the association's president Anita Ogulin.

She added that this approach should start with people not judging those who have found themselves in trouble for any reason.

Organisations have also called for greater protection of families with children and older people, with UNICEF Slovenia urging social partners to protect investments for children and families as austerity measures are looming due to the August floods.

It noted that child poverty in Slovenia increased and deepened during the austerity in 2012. ""In times of crisis and compensatory measures, it is important ... to protect the income of households with children,"" UNICEF added.

Slovenian Caritas also noted that poverty was present in Slovenia, especially in families with parents who receive minimum wage or very low income, and older people with low pensions.

This year, the organisation is helping more than 100,000 people in Slovenia with food, and last year it distributed more than 3,490 tonnes of staples. It stressed that those who live alone are at the greatest risk.

The NGO 8th March Institute urged the government to give up cuts in welfare and peg social transfers to inflation. It reminded the government of the promise in the coalition agreement of the fight against poverty and social exclusion.

The call comes as the government decided not to index child benefits, state scholarships, social assistance in cash, welfare benefits, rent subsidies, kindergarten and school meal subsidies to inflation to save money for the post-flood effort.

The NGO said that the government has not been successful in dealing with the increasing costs of living, as inflation is currently higher than in Slovenia in only two EU member states.

The Academy of Social Sciences association noted that almost one in two pensioners and almost one in six residents of Slovenia needed immediate and effective measures with the aim of reducing poverty and social exclusion.",social issue
Importance of upbringing noted at debate on gender equality,"A discussion on gender equality noted on Friday the importance of upbringing and parents serving as an example in reducing inequalities.

Klakočar Zupančič, formerly a judge, said that before entering politics, she had not perceived such a level of chauvinism and sexism, and that she had been surprised by the ""wave of misogyny that is still present in our society"".

She argued that women who dared to assume professional positions that had been traditionally perceived as male were breaking the glass ceiling, adding that this was the only way to achieve equality in practice.

MEP Ljudmila Novak (EPP/NSi) said she had encountered disparaging attitudes in the political arena because of her gender when she had ran for mayor. When the critics ran out of arguments as to why she was not a good mayor, they turned to the fact that she is a woman.

Novak added that ""society which does not utilise women's potential is impoverished. It's like someone using only half of their brain or only one ear or eye.""

Former swimmer and psychologist Sara Isaković and Rosana Kolar, holder of the Slovenian Woman Engineer of the Year title, have meanwhile had more pleasant experience in their fields, with Isaković saying that she had not felt inequality in her sport.

""I'm happy that I was in an environment where there is enough room for everybody to succeed. A female swimmer and a male swimmer are brought up in the same way. If you work hard, are motivated, if your head is in the right place, you can reach to the top,"" Isaković said.

Kolar, an aircraft mechanic, never heard anyone saying she was not capable of doing something because she was a women. She actually heard negative responses from women, ""who wondered whether I felt less feminine or whether I have maternal instincts"".

Foreign Ministry State Secretary Samuel Žbogar said that ""Slovenia has a much bigger problem with gender equality than it admits. Not only in politics but also in civil society"".

He noted certain negative responses to Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon announcing that Slovenia would lead a ""feminist foreign policy"".

Žbogar explained that meant that Slovenia advocated gender equality in foreign policy, as well as at the Foreign Ministry itself.

As one of the steps that could improve the situation, he noted the importance of upbringing and parents serving as an example, which Isaković agreed with.

""I come from a family that instilled confidence in me and gave me a sense of self-worth so that I could achieve whatever I wanted,"" said the silver Olympic medallist, noting that women too needed to start appreciating themselves.

The debate also featured Shiva Nazar Ahari, an Iranian journalist and author who has lived in Slovenia since 2018. She was imprisoned twice in Iran and she believes she would be in prison there today, had she stayed in her homeland.

She said that Iranian women had been systematically discriminated against for 40 years, which also depended on their families. ""If she comes from a poor environment, she will be married off before she even grows up.""

If a girl wants to attend school, she has to wear a headscarf from the age of seven, and she will face sexist content, as the educational system is intended to teach girls how to be a good wife and mother, she said.",social issue
RTV Slovenija and STA journalists stress importance of professional journalism,"Journalist representatives, in particular from the ranks of public broadcaster RTV Slovenija and the STA, marked World Press Freedom Day Wednesday with a gathering at which they highlighted the role of journalists in promoting democracy and human rights. They noted the importance of professional standards and of conditions needed to maintain them.","The public meeting was held in front of the building of RTV Slovenija, the bulk of whose journalists have been on strike for almost a year.

The head of RTV Slovenija's trade union confederation Helena Milinković said the decision to strike had been a measure of last resort, needed to defend journalistic and editorial autonomy, professional and ethical work, decent working conditions and to secure the depoliticisation of the public broadcaster.

She spoke of workforce and financial attrition, punishment through disciplinary procedures and pre-dismissal warnings, saying that ""censorship, digital harassment and violence, intimidation and even physical violence are the gravest kinds of threats to independent journalism and media freedom"" and that ""all this is being experienced by those at RTV Slovenija as well as by other journalists on a daily basis"".

Milinković noted that the state of the media in the country, in particular that of the public broadcaster, reflected the level of democracy as well as of basic freedoms, and of the political and general culture in society.

Meanwhile, Gorazd Jukovič pointed out on behalf of the editorial board of the Slovenian Press Agency that the public became engaged two years ago to the day in the salvaging of the STA, which had been left without public funding under the Janez Janša government.

""The financing was restored after more than 300 days, but the wounds caused by this unjustified interference in our autonomy will take a long time to heal. It is easy to demolish, harder to build,"" he said.

""We also see again and again that when one pushes the boundaries of decency, the boundaries between what is right versus what is wrong, the original boundaries are never again fully restored. This is also why the frontier of professional journalism needs to be protected continuously and persistently. Individually, with our own integrity and by maintaining an ethical stance, and together, with solidarity and support,"" Jukovič stressed.

He added that this was also the reason for the gathering in front of RTV Slovenija, which has been fighting for professional journalism for too long and which has also been backed by the public, ""the public we work for and for which it is worth fighting for"".

As for the STA, Jukovič added that its ""acute problems are currently solved, but we are still waiting for systemic solutions that would permanently safeguard our autonomy"".",social issue
Dnevnik says FSF award choice should lead to reckoning in film,"The decision of the judging panel at the Festival of Slovenian Film (FSF) to give the main award to an experimental documentary was a radical move, the newspaper Dnevnik says in its commentary on Tuesday. The victory of this independent production should lead to a reckoning that films should be much more than just sophisticated craft products.","""What does the fact that the national film award went to a film created without public funding say to the Slovenian film industry?""

Above all, it should not be interpreted that the industry can prosper with barely enough funds to get by, dependent on voluntary work, the sort that we see in Vesna winner Don't Think It Will Ever Pass, in which director Tomaž Grom channels his grief into art.

There is no doubt that the film is a masterpiece, turning away from convention, genre and dialogue to communicate the unspeakable void left behind by the death of a child. The film is felt before it can be truly understood. But this masterpiece is an exception, an anomaly, the paper says.

It must serve as a reminder that films should not be reduced to craft products that have nothing else to show for but technical sophistication. This is exactly what most films that lost out at the festival this year were: technically sound products that focus on moralising and dramatise mistakes and weaknesses without even trying to understand the psychology.

While a planned increase in funding will be key for the Slovenian film industry to survive and be competitive abroad, a serious consideration is needed about the legislation that disburses the funds. Sometimes, artists working on the margins are more deserving of the money than established directors, who tick many boxes but have nothing much to say any more.",social issue
"Roma community still neglected, president says","President Nataša Pirc Musar said after a consultation on the Roma on Tuesday that this community is still neglected and cannot access basic human rights such as potable water, education, social care and healthcare. Representatives of the Roma community were critical that the same discussion has been going on for 30 years.","The consultation, organised by the President at the occasion of International Romani day, celebrated on 8 April, brought together members of the Roma Association and councillors from municipalities where Roma have the right to a representative in the municipal council.

Pirc Musar was pleased that the government founded a special task force to tackle Roma issues, led by former Defence Minister Anton Grizold. The task force will first address the most problematic issues in an action plan and then work on systemic solutions, the president said.

Among the most pressing issues for the Roma community is limited access to drinking water, which is a basic human need, said the president. Because of poor sanitation infrastructure children cannot wash themselves properly and are bullied in school as a result, she noted.

The president was surprised to hear that medical staff and social workers no longer visit Roma settlements, which means that the community does not benefit from preventive awareness programmes on, for example, contraception and the correct use of medication. That is something that modern democracy should not permit, she said.

Roma Association president Jožek Horvat Muc noted that a lot has been done to benefit Roma settlements in areas where political will existed but neither money nor legislation helped where there was none. Living conditions in some settlements remain unacceptable due to unregulated ownership arrangements, zoning acts and subdivisions.

The Roma that wish to improve their living conditions by purchasing a house and integrating in some areas find the majority population reluctant to accept them as neighbours, said Horvat Muc.

According to Horvat Muc, the key problems of the Roma community are the lack of access to potable water, poor living conditions and healthcare. Things are changing for the worse in education, he noted.

Both Horvat and Grizold noted that the Slovenian society has been facing the same issues for 30 years without real progress. Horvat believes that all ineffective measures should be abandoned and new ones should be adopted instead.",social issue
Committee okays accessibility bill for the disabled,"The parliamentary Labour Committee amended and confirmed on Wednesday a government-sponsored bill on the accessibility of products and services for persons with disabilities, which transposes the relevant EU directive. Concern was voiced at the session about possible additional extension of relevant deadlines.","The bill looks to improve the functioning of the internal market when it comes to the accessibility of products and services and to enable persons with disabilities to equally use products and services in Slovenia.

It defines the conditions regarding the accessibility of computers and operating systems, payment terminals, ATMs, ticket vending machines and check-in machines and interactive self-service information terminals.

The bill also covers smartphones and other equipment for accessing telecommunications services, television equipment including digital television services, and e-readers, Labour Ministry State Secretary Dan Juvan told the MPs.

It also defines the conditions regarding the accessibility of audiovisual media and electronic communication services, and provides access to certain elements of air, bus, rail and water transportation services, such as websites, mobile services, e-tickets and information.

The bill furthermore regulates the conditions for accessibility of consumer banking services, e-books, e-commerce and replies to emergency calls on the single European number 112, Juvan noted.

At the session, head of the National Council of Disability Organisations Mateja Toman expressed concern that there could be additional extension of the deadlines and that accessibility was getting further away from persons with disabilities.

Anja Bah Žibert from the opposition Democrats (SDS) noted the numerous comments from the parliamentary legal service and said that the deadlines for certain measures, for instance accessibility of ATMs, had been set in a distant future.

Juvan said that most of the things noted by the parliamentary legal service had already been remedied and that the deadline for ATMs had been moved with an amendment from 2045 to 2025.

The committee meanwhile failed to endorse changes to pension legislation, filed by the SDS, which would raise the guaranteed old-age pension for 40 years of pensionable service from EUR 653 to EUR 771, and reintroduce the institute of state pension.

Juvan said that the government did not support the proposal, noting that the plan was to prepare starting points for a pension reform to be discussed by social partners as part of the Economic and Social Council by June.",social issue
Finance critical of government's approach to taxes,"In its commentary Why Not Introduce a Permanent Tax ""Just in Case"", Finance criticises the government for imposing ever new taxes and contributions on taxpayers and driving out investors, as the business newspaper proposes that it should secure the money to help flood victims from dividends paid out by state-owned companies.","The situation in Slovenia did not calm down yet after the Covid pandemic and after the Janez Janša government introduced (unconstitutional) taxes in the form of Covid fines, when the war in Ukraine broke out and fuel prices went up, the Robert Golob government took over and inflation increased, Finance lists some of the hardships.

It says both governments, Janša's and Golob's, have taken similar measures - ""worth billions, taken fast, not being thought-out, while they will have to be paid for"".

The first bills for various state aid schemes ""are already here, to be paid by us"", Finance says, pointing to net wages that are more heavily taxed than they would be had the Golob government not changed the Janša government's income tax law.

""We will also be probably paying more for healthcare, long-term care and pensions, and this won't be done without additional or higher contributions.""

On top of that, catastrophic floods hit the county last month with around 10% of the country's population in need of help.

But again the government resorted to what was easiest for it - it introduced a new, solidarity tax, for most of the people it will be 0.3% of their gross income.

While Finance agrees that the flood victims should be helped, this should not be done so that everyone else is made poorer, especially because the state has the money, reserves, it could issue bonds.

The paper says that is seems as is ""the floods are being used to somehow get people used to the word solidarity as a way of getting them used to ever-increasing taxes, each time presented with innovative prefixes, such as slidarity, charity, eco, bio, green, digital, sustainable, development, etc.""

Finance proposes that the state should get state-owned or partly state-owned companies to pay dividends to fill the post-flood reconstruction fund. It also wonders who would invest in a country that does not have a predictable business environment when it is more stable, safer, cheaper, more stimulating elsewhere.",social issue
Solidarity will be in focus of BSF this year (interview),"The Bled Strategic Forum (BSF), Slovenia's foremost foreign policy event, taking place next week, will focus on solidarity in facing global challenges. Following the devastating floods that hit parts of Slovenia in early August, the organisers decided to incorporate a charitable campaign, BSF secretary general Peter Grk told the STA.","Throughout the event, taking place on 28 and 29 August, the participants will have the chance to donate for the people who have been the most affected by the floods, Grk said.

The title ""Solidarity for Global Security"" was chosen before the floods, said Grk, adding that climate change is only one of the threats that will be discussed at the forum.

""The whole concept is geared toward addressing challenges that represent different threats for the broader global community: from climate change to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the energy and food crises,"" Grk said.

Highlighting solidarity, the title was also chosen with Slovenia's upcoming non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council in mind. The campaign that preceded the vote in June has opened Slovenia's foreign policy more broadly to the world, which is reflected in this year's BSF, drawing representatives from all five continents.

""In preparations for the non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council, talks, both bilateral and multilateral, led us to realise that all global challenges have one thing in common: they need to be resolved through cooperation, we need to listen to one another, and certain core values need to be upheld, including human rights, democracy, solidarity and transparency.""

Grk said that the global multilateral system had become rather unresponsive to modern challenges and was no longer a good fit for the modern world. ""The fact that the multilateral system is failing is one of the biggest problems we face at the moment,"" said Grk, adding that this was something Slovenia would be addressing in its capacity as non-permanent member of the Security Council.

The BSF will feature numerous panel debates with guests from all over the world, among them EU Council President Charles Michel, the presidents of Greece, Moldova, prime ministers of Western Balkan countries, as well as 14 foreign ministers from across the globe.

""We aspired to bringing as many global community representatives to this year's forum as possible, so as to make the debates as constructive and as broad as possible.""

This will be the 18th iteration of the BSF and Grk believes that the event has become one of the leading strategic platforms of its kind in Europe. This means that the organisers have no trouble attracting guests, or forging partnerships with numerous think-tanks and civil society organisations from all over the world.

However, a large number of participants presents a significant logistical and infrastructural challenge. Therefore, the BSF will be transformed in the coming years into a brand and a platform featuring events throughout the year and drafting analytical papers about modern-day challenges.

""In fact, one of the main challenges is how to implement and upgrade ideas from the many good discussions taking place at the forum,"" said Grk.

A successful instance of this was last year's water safety discussion, which resulted in a declaration that was later also discussed in the UN. ""This is the soft power of the BSF and of Slovenia's foreign policy, which we would like to make better use of in the future.""

Moreover, the organisers are striving to make the event as sustainable and environment-friendly as possible. On the one hand, sustainable development and climate change take a prominent place in the BSF's agenda, and on the other, they are trying to take very concrete steps in terms of food and transport.

In this vein, guests will be able to travel from Ljubljana to Bled by train this year, as the forum will be taking place in cooperation with the Slovenian Railways.",social issue
Group says state leaders systematically neglecting Christian heritage,"The Assembly for the Republic issued on Tuesday an open letter to ""the Slovenian public and the politicians responsible"" to protest against what it calls systematic neglect of the heritage of Christianity. The conservative group primarily took issue with President Nataša Pirc Musar, while also being critical of Slovenian bishops.","The letter, penned by theologian and philosopher Janez Juhant, highlights the recent Forum for Dialogue and Peace in the Balkans meeting organised in Koper by the Slovenian Bishops Conference and also addressed by Pirc Musar.

The group wonders whether the president's ""words of peace, interfaith cooperation, respect for human rights, and equality should apply not only to the people of neighbouring countries but primarily to Slovenian citizens"".

Arguing the forum lacked ""concreted initiatives for resolving these matters in Slovenia"", the letter says that the exchange of opinions in various forums is credible ""if people consistently demonstrate their pro-dialogue and open democratic attitude"".

The group reproached Pirc Musar for having attended the Ljubljana Pride Parade and visited the Vatican while failing to support initiatives like the Movement for Life or to attend the mass for the homeland held to mark Statehood Day.

""Why does she not actively advocate for the burial of the concealed and exhumed victims of the revolution, Romani people, Slovenian Home Guard members, and other similar victims, just as she advocates for the victims of the Holocaust, Srebrenica, and others?"" the group wrote, while also calling on the president to act against the bill on assisted suicide.

""Systematic neglect of the heritage of Christianity and Enlightenment signifies the elimination of healthy family and social foundations and relationships,"" the letter says, while singling out as particularly problematic ""the imposing of reprehensible sexual 'teachings' on children and rejecting the right to life of unborn children"".

Meanwhile, the Assembly for the Republic also called on bishops to strengthen dialogue within the Church so that they can ""stand stronger against the attempts of the ruling circles to divide us and thus govern us more easily"". It indicated the Church is not firm enough in its ""opposition to the ruling echelons"".",social issue
Equality ombudsman speaks out as Roma denied service in bar,"The Advocate of the Principle of Equality has found that a group of Roma men were discriminated against based on their ethnicity in a bar on the outskirts of Murska Sobota, north-east, not far from the Roma village of Pušča.","According to a complaint that the advocate received about the incident, they were refused service, with the waitress outright telling them that she would not serve them because they were Roma.

She told them that prior to their visit, a group of Roma had started a fight at the bar. The waitress allegedly also said that if she served them, she would have to serve all other Roma who come to the bar as well.

The Advocate of the Principle of Equality has corroborated the claims made in the complaint.

A lawyer representing the bar told the institution that the waitress refused service to the group because she was certain that one of them was involved in a physical attack against her and in the fight that took place prior to their visit.

The equality ombudsman turned to the local police force and established that none of the three guests who were refused service was in the bar at the time of the fight.

Moreover, it is not on bars and waiters, but on the police to sanction persons due to violations of public peace and order, the institution said.",social issue
Children Are at Stake Coalition going to ECHR over gay marriage and adoptions,The conservative Children Are at Stake Coalition filed on Thursday an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after being prohibited by parliament and the Constitutional Court to call a referendum against gay marriage and adoptions.,"The move comes after the civil group's unsuccessful top court challenge of the decision by parliament banning a referendum on October 2022 changes to the family code that enacted gay marriage and adoption in line with a Constitutional Court ruling.

The Children Are at Stake Coalition, which has been campaigning against marriage equality for years, argues that the adoption of children into same-sex families is not a human right and that by bringing the case before the ECHR they are defending democracy in the country.

The group plans to invoke Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely the right to a fair trial and the right to an effective remedy.

While also finding it contentious that the government and parliament adopted the changes in fast-track procedure, the outfit argues the Constitutional Court had failed to address the key question of whether the changes passed in fact went beyond what had been demanded by the top court by ""extending the diction on adoption or marriage to education, health, social affairs"".

The group's head Aleš Primc moreover claims that the Constitutional Court panel included a judge who featured as an activist in the 2012 referendum campaign on the topic. Primc, who also spearheaded the 2012 referendum at which a previous attempt to expand the rights of same-sex couples was rejected, did not name the judge but he is confident the ECHR will establish ""this judging was completely unfair"".

According to Primc, the changes to the family code will lead to ""attempts to introduce LGBT+ ideology into the education system"". He believes the group will succeed in their appeal with the ECHR and that a second referendum will ""demonstrate in a massive way that a child needs a mother and a father"".",social issue
Ministry acting on driving licence issue affecting minority in Italy,"The Foreign Ministry has called on the Italian government on several occasions to convene a meeting of a body dealing with minority issues after ethnic Slovenians have been required to pay extra to have their names written correctly in driving licences. However, the meeting has not been called.","The ministry said this in response to a question from ruling coalition MPs who noted that members of the Slovenian ethnic minority in Italy have to pay extra to have their name written with č, š, ž - the three Slovenian letters the Italian alphabet does not have - when extending their driving licence.

The three Freedom Movement MPs asked Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon how she plans to act to stop such injustice being done to minority members.

The ministry replied that, through its diplomatic and consular missions, it ""closely monitors the situation and the exercise of the rights of the Slovenian community arising from Italy's obligations under international law and its national legislation"".

The ministry has repeatedly called on the Italian authorities to convene a meeting of a body that gives Slovenian minority members direct access to the Italian government as soon as possible, but the body has not yet met under the current Italian government.

Fajon has also specifically drawn the attention of her Italian counterpart, Antonio Tajani, to this issue during his visit to Ljubljana on 17 March.

The body, which falls under the remit of the Italian Ministry of Home Affairs, allows Slovenian minority members to discuss all issues as they arise with government members directly, including issues such as the Slovenian lettering in driving licences.

The correct spelling of names is enshrined in Italian legislation, the ministry pointed out. ""The problem that has arisen with the spelling of the Slovenian letters in the extension of driving licences is part of a series of technical and administrative inconsistencies on the part of the relevant Italian authorities,"" the ministry said.

""The flaws occurred in the issuance of certain types of identity documents in the processes of digitisation in the public administration,"" the ministry explained, promising to continue to draw Italy's attention to the unacceptability of such errors.",social issue
Issue of poverty among working people raised on poverty day,"On the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, humanitarian organisations in Slovenia warned about poverty among the working population, noting that those who live alone are particularly at risk due to the high costs of living and unregulated housing policy.","This year's day runs under the theme Decent Work and Social Protection: Putting Dignity in Practice, and notes the common goal of the global society is to strive for as few working people as possible to be exposed to the risk of poverty.

Last year, 4.8% of working adults in Slovenia lived below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold. In the last decade, this proportion was lower only in 2019, at 4.5%, shows data from the national Statistics Office.

In Slovenia, this proportion was lower than the EU average in 2022 (8.5%), with Romania (14.5%) and Luxembourg (12.9%) leading the way, and Finland (2.5%) and the Czech Republic (3.4%) having the lowest proportions.

Many older people also find themselves in poverty, especially those with low pensions. Last year, charities provided material aid and helped pay the most important bills for more than 17,600 older people, which is 17% more than the year before.

Added to this should be more than 8,700 households in which people of active age live alone, Slovenian Caritas warns, while the Slovenian Red Cross notes that despite some promising indicators, the number of aid recipients has not decreased.

Among the recipients is a growing number of employees who receive wages that are not sufficient for a decent living, pensioners with low pensions, single-parent families and single-person households.

The organisation notes that it provided help to more than 110,000 individuals with various forms of material aid.

The humanitarian Association of Friends of Youth Ljubljana Moste-Polje meanwhile pointed to the distress of children and families, which is invisible to society while greatly affecting their daily life and children's development.

This places them in a very unequal position compared to their peers, it said, adding that those who work but cannot make ends meet do not feel like an equal part of society, as there is still a strong stigma associated with poverty.

One of the association's humanitarian programmes has involved mainly employed or working people for several years, which means that their income is not sufficient for the basic needs of the family. The share of families where parents work but still struggle reaches up to 65% of all families involved.

""The current policy will not make poverty disappear, it remains among us, so it is up to us as individuals to make a difference in society with solidarity and empathy,"" said the association's president Anita Ogulin.

She added that this approach should start with people not judging those who have found themselves in trouble for any reason.",social issue
"Worried they may not get public funds, NGOs want allegations about open call cleared","The NGOs selected to receive funds in a EUR 10.6 million open call issued by the Public Administration Ministry in the spring are worried about suspicion of its intransparency and want the allegations to be thoroughly examined. Some fear they might not get the funds, as the minister has announced to annul the open call.","The ministry published the call in March to boost active civil rights and empower NGOs and citizens to prevent non-democratic practices witnessed during the Covid epidemic from repeating. It said at the time that this was the first open call providing funds for this purpose.

Since media reports alleged intransparency in the selection of NGOs for funding, Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik has asked ministry services to tell her how to annul the call. ""As soon as there is a legal basis for this, believe me, I'll do it,"" she has recently said. No contract has yet been signed with selected NGOs.

One of the biggest recipients is the Institute for Gender Equality Studies (IPES), run by Hovnik's former business partner Kaja Primorac, winning EUR 300,000.

Primorac is at the same time director and co-owner of Smart Center, the company of which Minister Hovnik was co-owner and director until mid-June 2022.

As Smart Center director, Primorac came under fire for having helped other NGOs prepare the documentation for the open call, charging a fee for the services.

She has told the STA that Smart Center, whose main line of business is preparing documents for tenders and open calls for companies and NGOs, had had a contract with two NGOs for this call, but since the NGOs broke cooperation with Smart Center, the company will not get any payment.

""If I had known what inconvenience this would cause, I would have acted differently today,"" she has told the STA. Primorac had also worked on IPES's application as well as on the applications of the Peace Institute and Zavod ZRI, but no contracts were signed to charge them any fees.

With EUR 580,000, the biggest recipient is CER Partnerstvo, an institute relatively unknown to the general public, which features representatives of several companies.

This raised questions whether it qualifies as NGO under the Act on NGOs, as 10 of the 11 members on its council are reps of companies and employer chambers.

While some see it as a business interest group, CER has told the STA its goals are energy efficiency in sustainable development, for which it received NGO status in 2021.

The publisher Beletrina has received nearly EUR 410,000, but media have highlighted it had expanded its line of business to protection of democracy and vulnerable groups as well as to information society and science only four days before the 15 May deadline to submit the applications, while publishing the overhauled internal document two weeks after the tender closed.

Beletrina hopes to eventually get the funds to implement ""our plans in raising awareness about the role of online access for the disabled and the elderly"", also because there have been no open calls for online access recently.

Other NGOs are worried that they might not get the funds, which means they would be left without a major source of funding in the coming years. They pointed out they are not responsible for this situation, pointing a finger at suspicion of corruption and calling for clarification.

PIC - Legal Centre for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment is worried about the allegations raised in the media ""about such an important call for us"".

""So we expect state institutions to immediately clear up all doubts, and take measures to eliminate irregularities in case they are are established,"" PIC wrote.

Similarly, the NGO umbrella CNVOS wrote that ""public funding of NGOs must be fully transparent... Any conflict of interest must be avoided, any political interference is forbidden.""

Available data shows according to CNVOS that nine projects submitted by five organisations out of a total of 48 projects submitted by 45 bidders could be problematic.

It is thus against annulling the entire call, especially since the allegations have not yet been cleared and not all NGOs had something to do with the minister's friend.

Should it prove the entire call is flawed, then it should be annulled, while senior officials should take responsibility for the collapse of the system of safeguards at the ministry.

The national anti-graft commission will also look into the matter.",social issue
Critical sectors to operate on Monday despite flood relief day,"A number of exceptions will apply on 14 August, when people in Slovenia will have a day off to be able to help with floods relief efforts. In line with a decree to be issued on Friday, employees in critical infrastructure, public health, social work, and veterinary services are expected to work normally.","If necessary, kindergartens will also be open on Monday to provide childcare in the flood-affected areas. Emergency service providers will also be working as usual on this day, as will institutional care providers, which include care homes for the elderly.

Due to the emergency situation, freight vehicles exceeding 7.5 tonnes in maximum weight - usually prohibited Sundays and during work-free days - will be allowed on Monday, meaning international freight transport will be permitted.

In line with the decree issued as the floods began, retailers wishing to remain open will be able to do so despite Monday being a work-free day. Some of the retailers have also helped raise help for those impacted by the floods.

All payment systems, including August 14 transactions, will function normally. Bank branches will be closed, but insurance companies will operate.

Intercity public passenger bus services and internal rail services will operate according to the planned weekday summer holidays timetable. Certain routes are still not running due to severed connections.

The head of the Government Communication Office, Petra Bizjak Cirman, told the press that potential additions to the list of exceptions would be announced as soon as possible.

Slovenia and Croatia to formalise emergency health service cooperation,"Slovenia and Croatia will sign an agreement on Friday, formalising an existing protocol under which people living just across the border in the Croatian region of Istria have access to emergency medical services of the Izola general hospital, with expenses paid for by the Croatian public health insurance fund.","The agreement will be signed by prime minister Andrej Plenoković and Robert Golob during Golob's first official visit to Zagreb.

It will formalise an existing cross-border protocol on emergency medical services, which include strokes, infarctions and severe injuries, the Izola hospital told the STA on Wednesday. The number of patients is not expected to increase.

The objective is to provide better access to emergency services and hospital treatment to persons in northern Istria in need of urgent medical help, the Health Ministry said in a statement for the STA.

Istria is home to some 320,000 people and during the summer tourist season the number of people doubles, while roads see a significant increase in traffic. This cooperation will improve outcomes for patients with life-threatening conditions, the ministry added.

The idea was developed from Emergency EuroRegion, a three-year EU project launched by several partners, including the Izola hospital, in 2017.

The project indicated several possible solutions which will now be formalised upon Croatia's wish. The agreement will cover residents and tourists staying in Umag, Novigrad, Buje, Brtonigla, Grožnjan and Oprtalj.

The hospital is expected to handle patients from Croatia without problems. ""Based on experience from the project, we do not expect any problems in providing emergency services,"" the ministry said.

Treatment of Croatian citizens will be paid by Croatia's health insurance fund, while treatment of other EU citizens will be paid by their respective insurers.",disaster and accident
"Bridge designing will have to change, says expert","Marjan Pipenbaher, an internationally acclaimed construction engineer and bridge designer, believes climate change will have to be taken into account when planning transport infrastructure and rebuilding bridges that have been destroyed by the floods.","Due to the abnormal amount of rainfall torrential river flows in the latest floods exceeded the volumes determined in hydraulic studies. As a result many bridges collapsed, Pipenbaher has told the STA,

In some places, the river flows passed hundred-year water levels that determined the dimensions of the river bed and the bridge spans, he explained.

Another major problem was fallen trees and other debris swept along by the water, which then piled up in between supporting pillars and under the carriageway structures, which further obstructed the flow.

Taking into account these new circumstances, the hydraulic studies of rivers will have to be amended and construction adapted accordingly, he said.

When designing and building bridges across torrential rivers, building pillars in river beds will have to be avoided as much as possible, he said.

""Such construction will be somewhat more expensive, but the risks of reduced flow capacity and collapses will be significantly reduced,"" he believes.

Reconstructing bridges with spans of up to 10 metres takes between 14 days and three months. When it comes to bridges across torrential rivers, spanning 30 to 100 metres, as most Slovenian bridges are, it takes between one and six months, depending on how bad the damage. ""Some bridges will have to be torn down and built anew,"" Pipenbaher said.

He trusts that reconstruction and renovation of the damaged bridges will be done properly. ""Some temporary bridges may have to be built to set up essential links, but these will later be replaced by bridges of high quality construction.""

Pipenbaher believes that Slovenia has enough bridge designers and builders, but says that the whole construction community will have to come together. Aid is also coming from abroad, in particular building machinery and pontoon bridges.",disaster and accident
Ljubljana expects state to see to Sava flood defences,"Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković called on the state authorities to deal with the Sava River flood defences as a priority, as he told reporters on Tuesday that the municipality would pay for the repair and reconstruction of homes and infrastructure damaged in the early August flooding itself.","While Ljubljana was largely spared by the early-August floods owning to flood safety measures applied in the past, the flooding Sava caused extensive damage in the residential area of Sneberje on the eastern outskirts of the city and wiped out the kayak centre in Tacen in the north.

The mayor said that damage registration teams had completed their work, assessing the damage at EUR 7 million, of which EUR 4 million to residential buildings.

Considering the damage is much more substantial in other parts of the country, the municipality would take care of the damaged and destroyed infrastructure and homes itself, but the mayor said their only request was for the state to tackle the Sava as a priority.

Hydrologist Rok Fazarinc has examined the Sava in the Sneberje area and has drawn up a proposal of protective measures, the mayor said. Based on his findings, Ljubljana officials will be meeting representatives of the national Water Agency to agree the measures.

Households affected by the floods will get 15,000 or 10,000 euros to repair their homes; those with a monthly income of up to EUR 1,500 will get the higher amount and the rest will get the lower amount. Aid will not be paid for illegally built homes.

The city called on companies operating in Ljubljana to donate towards the cause; so far EUR 1.7 million has been pledged, of which EUR 800,000 has been transferred to the account of the local branch of the charity Friends of the Youth, which will distribute the funds.

The aid to households equals 75% or 50% of the cost of reconstruction with a uniform cost of EUR 20,000 per unit agreed with nine providers. Janković said the residents all but closed deals for reconstruction with seven providers for a total of 56 homes.

Anita Ogulin of the charity involved said residents had moved out of eleven homes in Sneberje because they were no longer fit to live in. The municipality will also find temporary replacement homes for other residents if they decide to move out while their homes are repaired.",disaster and accident
"Govt will help storm-stricken areas, but it may take time, Golob says","Prime Minister Robert Golob visited the municipality of Brežice in the east, one of those hit by yesterday's severe storms. He promised that the government will try to do all in its power to provide help to the locals as soon as possible. He, however, admitted that ""regular procedures"" are rather lengthy.","While the clear-up costs will be reimbursed in the coming weeks, it takes longer to provide state aid for damaged crops and for repair works.

""I was optimistic during last year's drought thinking the damage could be paid quickly in a regular procedure, but that's not the case. When we took the regular route, it took until March or April to pay out the damages,"" Golob said.

He pledged to try and find a way to help the locals as soon as possible, while admitting that there are no clear answers yet.

Before Golob visited Brežice, the government twitted his statement that this is a major natural disaster where the state will have to help out.

Earlier in the day, Rudi Medved, a state secretary at the Defence Ministry, visited Krško, another municipality in the east.

He said that while damage is still being assessed, it is already clear it will be ""very, very big"", much bigger than the EUR 5 million from May storms in the northeast.

He said the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief has already asked the municipalities to assess the costs of yesterday's emergency efforts, and they will be later asked to assess the costs of repair works.

Municipalities used to cover the costs of emergency efforts on their own, but under last year's change of legislation, the Civil Protection commander has the option of proposing the state pay for the clean-up costs. Commander Srečko Šestan, who accompanied Medved, said he will do that.

Different areas around Slovenia were affected to different degrees. Crops were hit hardest around Brežice, Krško has many cars and some 200 building damaged, the situation is similar in Prekmurje, while flash floods affected Cerkno in the west.

Krško Mayor Janez Kerin said that all unprotected vineyards, orchards and gardens were damaged in his municipality, while crops on fields have been 90% ruined.",disaster and accident
Delo urges govt to move away from post-flood populism,"It would not be fair to put the flood recovery costs on taxpayers or individual economic sectors, the newspaper Delo says on Thursday, calling on the government to move away from the current populist gestures.","The commentary Cards on the Table notes that the upcoming phase of flood relief will require ""cards on the table"" - damage assessment and repair and a plan of investments and measures to ensure Slovenia fares better when natural disasters strike in the future.

""Once the government is preparing a roadmap for natural disaster protection, it will have to move away from the current exuberance and populism,"" says Delo, adding that the idea to introduce ""solidarity Saturdays"" indicates ""populism, far from reality"" and brings to mind the Communist regime in the former Yugoslavia.

The newspaper is also against the idea to tax banks' profits to finance the reconstruction effort, pointing out that banks and insurers are not responsible for the flood damage.

They can play a part in the effort ""but the government's task is to prepare measures to allow financial institutions to reduce the burden on the affected people in the framework of banking business"".

Noting that the floods were a wake-up call that ""public infrastructure is not just salaries of civil servants"", the commentary says that if the government is looking for additional recovery funds, it should consider reducing public sector costs.",disaster and accident
"PM Golob: Two-thirds of country affected, damage to exceed EUR 500m (adds)","Two-thirds of Slovenia is affected by flash floods as the country is faced with the worst natural disaster in its history. Although last night was less severe, the damage is likely to exceed EUR 500 million, Prime Minister Robert Golob said on Saturday after a session of the National Security Council and ahead of a government session.","Road and energy infrastructure has been hit particularly hard alongside hundreds of homes, he said, adding that it will take major efforts to restore normal life.

Črna na Koroškem, a town in a narrow valley in Koroška region, is still completely cut off, with drinking water and equipment in short supply, which will be airlifted there, said Golob.

While shops are closed on Sundays, those selling food and hardware will remain open tomorrow and extend their opening hours to speed up rehabilitation efforts, he said.

Golob does not find declaring an emergency necessary for now, arguing the country has one of the best disaster relief and civil protection systems in Europe.

Both Golob and President Nataša Pirc Musar thanked all those taking part in relief and rescue efforts for their good and dedicated work.

All politicians sitting on the National Security Council, which also features members of the opposition, agreed this is no time for divisions, but for united action.

Golob said that ""I want this political unity to last as long as possible"".

Similarly, Pirc Musar said she ""is extremely happy that the opposition is here with us, that we have national consciousness to work together to do what can be done in this difficult times"".

She reiterated her message to Slovenian residents that they are not alone, ""that the Republic of Slovenia with all of its resources will do what it can"" to help.

The government is now in session discussing changes to the Natural Disaster Recovery Act to empower mayor to take emergency measures past the public procurement system.

Golob expects this legislative change to enable residents to get back to normal faster, while expecting parliament to pass the bill on Tuesday or Wednesday.

The National Security Council discussed reports by Civil Protection, the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration, and the defence and interior ministries.

Pirc Musar said that over the past 48 hours more than 3,000 events have been recorded in 145 of Slovenia's 212 municipalities, while 121 people were evacuated with a helicopter. ""These figures, of course, speak of the terrible proportions of the catastrophe which Slovenia has not yet witnessed since its independence.""

The president has been rang up by her counterparts from Croatia, Hungary and Kosovo.

""Neighbouring countries in particular follow what is going on in our country,"" she said, adding that several countries have offered help, but Slovenia will decide what exactly it needs.

The president also urged people to help in relief efforts once the waters have receded. The government will produce a detailed plan, but post-flood efforts will also require solidarity, she said, calling on everyone to help.

Meanwhile, the need to set aside political divides was echoed by the heads of the opposition Democrats (SDS) and New Slovenia (NSi), Janez Janša and Matej Tonin.

Both Janša and Tonin moreover proposed that the state delegate more of its relief finances and decision making powers to municipalities, including when it comes to watercourse maintenance. Tonin said the municipalities know their territory and issues best.

Janše also spoke about the pending emergency law being a good opportunity to lay down all needed prevention planning and secure faster procedures.

He invoked the example of the Mokrice hydro power station, whose construction on the Sava has not made headway due to opposition by environmentalists.

He argued that Mokrice, with its planned flood protection additions, would have protected a large part of the municipality of Brežice in the east from flooding.",disaster and accident
"One person killed, two seriously hurt in blast in Vrhnika (adds)","One person has died and two have been seriously injured in an explosion that occurred just before noon on Friday at a facility of fireworks manufacturer Hamex in the town of Vrhnika, south-west of Ljubljana.","The wider area has been secured and firefighters are in control of the situation, the Ljubljana Police Administration said. Police explained that several explosions had occurred and that the cause remained to be determined.

"Leak source at Krško N-plant identified, issue to take a few weeks","The Krško nuclear power plant has said it has identified the micro-location of the increased leakage in the primary system that was detected last week and that led to the plant's precautionary shutdown on Friday. An analysis and a plan for dealing with the cause have been announced, with the issue expected to take a few weeks to be resolved.","Representatives of Slovenia's sole nuclear power station wrote they were in constant contact with national and international institutions and companies to secure support for the plant to be reconnected to the grid as soon as possible. They however added that it was too early to say when this would happen.

The plant said last Thursday that increased leakage had been detected, but that it did not have an impact on employees or the environment and was within safe limits.

On Thursday evening, a controlled, gradual reduction of power started and by Friday morning the plant was disconnected from the grid.

Following an inspection, it was found that a further cooling of the plant to a so-called cold shutdown was necessary to accurately locate the leak, taking into account the need to ensure safe working conditions. This was put in place at the weekend.

Representatives of the power plant explained today that a cold shutdown means that the plant is not generating electricity and that the temperature and pressure in the primary circuit are significantly reduced, while the conditions for safe operation are guaranteed.

""Nuclear safety has also been assured since the first indication of a leak. All decisions have been and will be based on a conservative principle and a culture of high safety, which ensures the safety of employees, the public and the environment,"" the Krško plant wrote.

Nuclear physicist Leon Cizelj, the head of the reactor technology department at the Jožef Stefan Institute, told the STA last week that such events were not frequent, but they were not dangerous.

""Permitted leaking is within the scope of a leaking water tap, about three litres per minute. But it is detected much sooner than this much leakage actually happens,"" said Cizelj, who does not expect the environment or staff will be exposed to radiation.

The Nuclear Safety Administration has been notified of the preventive shutdown.

The primary system's job is to produce heat and transfer it from the reactor to the steam engine.

The power plant has been in continuous operation since the end of the month-long regular maintenance shutdown in autumn 2022.",disaster and accident

Runaway driver crashes car with migrants into barrier wall,"In the early morning hours, a car carrying illegal migrants crashed into a motorway barrier wall, after which the driver tried to escape police by driving over 230 kilometres per hour, the Koper Police Department said on Monday.","After the crash, several migrants came jumping out of the car and the driver fled. Out of the six migrants in the car, which had Hungarian licence plates, four were Pakistanis, one Indian and one Bangladeshi. The two that were hiding in the trunk sustained mild injuries, the police said.

This was the second such incident on Slovenian roads in recent days. On Friday, the police apprehended a 19-year-old runaway Serbian driver smuggling three Turkish migrants who was speeding and zigzagging along the motorway towards the Dobruška Vas exit, south-east. As the police caught up with him, he tried to escape on foot.

Floods change landscape in Kamnik area,"Two valleys in the Kamnik area, north of Ljubljana, have been reshaped by the recent floods, Kamnik Mayor Matej Slapar has told the STA, while a local flood survivor noted that the worst part of the whole ordeal was being cut off from the rest of the country.","""I was awakened by an awful sound of roaring as the creek swept away cars and rolled in rocks,"" Stane Leskošek, a Črna pri Kamniku local, told the STA.

Seeking refuge from the floods, he fled to higher ground, and hours passed before he managed to get in contact with his neighbours. The citizens of the Črna village were cut off from the rest of the country the entire first day of last weekend's floods, he said, adding this was the worst part of the whole ordeal.

""I thought other people did not even know what happened in Črna."" On the second day after the first wave of severe floods hit, he heard the comforting sounds of heavy machinery attempting to break through the mud and landslides.

Roads leading to villages in the area were more or less reopened on Monday, so that heavy machinery and relief and rescue vehicles could get to where they are needed, but there are still certain villages that are cut-off. Some 300 firefighters are attempting to get to them, Mayor Slapar said.

The worst-hit in the area were the valleys of Črna, Kamniška Bistrica and Bistrica. The Tunjice and Laniše valleys have been completely reshaped by the raging local rivers, which deposited gravel up to one metre high and filled in parts of these valleys, the mayor said.

In the wake of the floods that hit two-thirds of the country several rivers have slightly changed their courses or switched to nearby ones, for example, the Meža in the northern Koroška region mistaking a road for a river bed. Noting that it is a process of reshaping landscapes as old as time, experts say that in the era of modern civilization this will have to be tackled carefully.

Same as in other affected areas, the clean-up effort is in full swing in the Kamnik area. The municipality's public utility company is doing its best to repair the water supply system, but certain places are still short on drinking water, and so water tanks have been provided.

Electricity is back on, except in certain areas where they are using generators until power is restored.

There is enough food supplies, but what the locals are missing in the recovery effort is boots, since theirs have been either swept away or destroyed by the floods, Leskošek said.

The municipality is facing enormous amounts of waste post-floods, a problem that has been reported by others as well. The state will have to step in and help, the mayor said, same as with all the other relief efforts.

The full recovery will take years, Slapar said, since the valleys, river beds and retaining walls will have to be rebuild.",disaster and accident
Pirc Musar calls for shift in attitude towards nature,"Getting briefed on storm damage and clean-up efforts in the Celje area on Friday, President Nataša Pirc Musar said that severe storms were unfortunately becoming a reality, and so people should change their attitude towards nature.","Pirc Musar visited several places in the Vojnik municipality in eastern Slovenia, where storms have caused extensive damage in recent weeks. She met with Vojnik Mayor Branko Petre and regional civil protection officials.

""Even though there are hard days behind us, I get an additional boost of energy motivating me to work when I see how people help each other after the storms,"" she said.

Aware that state aid is needed in the recovery effort, the president said she had discussed this with Prime Minister Robert Golob a few days ago.

""I can assure you that they are doing all they can to provide aid quicker than so far,"" she told the press and called for a shift in people's mindset and attitude towards nature.

The association announced it would file similar suits against Telemach and T-2 in the coming days.

The lawsuits follow after the VZMD called for an out-of-court settlement in October 2022, urging the companies to discontinue the unfair practices and refund their customers for the excess charges.

The association estimates that a total of 1.5 million customers of the four providers suffered an estimated EUR 200 million in damage.

Record number of Slovenians registered as posthumous organ donors last year,"Last year, a record number of Slovenians decided to become posthumous organ donors, the Slovenija-Transplant national institute said on Wednesday. The target for heart and lungs donors was exceeded by more than 60%. Just over 160 patients waited for an organ transplantation last year.","The institute beefed up its activities last year and held targeted meetings in donor hospitals, where potential donors are identified.

""This is why it is no coincidence that we have exceeded our annual targets in several segments. Among other things, we have surpassed the magical threshold of 20 actual donors per million inhabitants, and with 23.24 donors per million inhabitants we ranked third among Eurotransplant member countries,"" said Andrej Gadžijev, the institute's director.

The number of hearts and lungs donations exceeded the plan by more than 60%, and the number of corneas donations exceeded the target of 120 by 51.

Last year, 170 organs were donated posthumously, including 24 hearts. Two kidneys were donated by living donors. The transplant centre at the UKC Ljubljana hospital transplanted 109 organs, including 29 hearts.

Nevertheless, 161 patients were still on the waiting list for an organ transplant at the end of the year. The average waiting time for a kidney is 350 days, for a heart 240 days, liver 108 days and lungs 179.

Last year, the highest number of people registered as posthumous organ donors, 2,011, mostly in the 19-28 age group. So far, 13,498 people have been registered as donors.

Some 80% of the newly registered donors registered via e-mail last year, a significant increase compared to past years, and transplantation coordinators conducted almost twice as many interviews with relatives about organ donating than the year before.

The Slovenian national tissue and cell code has also been created as part of the national tissue and cell information system, which is a unique and pioneering work in the EU.

The accurate code ensures better traceability and transparency for institutions and donors for all tissues and cells. Logistical processes and protocols enabling the exchange of organs and tissues with the nearby airports in Munich, Graz and Vienna have also been improved, the institute said.",human interest
Delo says govt will be assessed based on long-term measures,"The latest public ratings survey conducted by Mediana shows that the opposition Democrats (SDS) is ahead of the ruling Freedom Movement for the first time since the election although the margin is less than two percentage points. But on the other hand, the work of the government was assessed much better than in the past months, Delo says.","The proportions of those assessing the government work as positive and of those seeing it as negative are level. Only a month ago the difference was 15 percentage points in favour of those assessing it negatively, Delo says in Wednesday's front-page commentary.

""We could conclude that the data shows that a large part of the public finds that the government has responded well to the flooding that destroyed many towns and stripped many of everything they had.""

The trend in the coming weeks and months will depend on government flood-related measures as well.

For now it seems that the exceptional work of the civil protection, firefighters, charities and numerous other volunteers gives hope and inspires optimism. But the efforts will be long and hard, and how the government will go about it in the long run will be what will most probably define its success in the long-term, Delo says.

Prime Minister Robert Golob is aware of this, saying that the figures will be very high but that they will need to be fair and that a system will have to be established so that everyone is compensated proportionally for what they have lost.

They placed the beehive on the roof of the police building by the City Park. The move honours the long beekeeping tradition in the region and draws on the expertise of beekeepers in the force.

""The project strengthens cooperation with our employees, as well as with police organisations and retired colleagues, many of whom have actively contributed to the project,"" the police said.

Also involved in the project was the Alojz Greif Hoče Beekeeping Association, whose members helped make the beehive and contributed material and their expertise.

Dolphin centre to open in Piran in mid-June,"Morigenos, the Slovenian marine mammal association, will open a dolphin centre in Piran on 13 June for visitors to learn about the life of dolphins in an interactive manner and to get to know the marine world in more detail. An important mission will also be raising awareness about the role of science for sea conservation.","The association would like the Dolphin Education and Research Centre to become a meeting point of science and education on marine mammals, says Tilen Genov, Morigenos's founder and president.

He says the centre is intended for visitors from home and abroad, individuals and organised groups, including schools. It will host workshops and meetings of scientists.

""We'd like to create a centre that offers a new opportunity in terms of science and conservation. After all, it will be a place where young people can spend their spare time doing something useful and fun.""

The centre will feature multimedia content and exhibitions, while visitors will also be able to see a life-size model of a dolphin and parts of a skeleton.

In a sound room, they will get an opportunity to immerse into the sea world and listen to sounds made by animals but also by people.

The project won public and EU funds as part of the strategy of local development in the region of Istria in 2021, but to have the centre the way the association had imagined it, they have launched a fundraiser aiming to raise EUR 5,000 by the end of July.

Morigenos is an organisation that largely consists of volunteers who monitor and study dolphins in Slovenian and surrounding waters. For the past 20 years, their research has been contributing to the understanding and protection of dolphins and the conservation of marine ecosystems.

Looking at its beginnings, Genov said when he received the Prometheus of Science award for excellence in science communication for 2021 that his ambition to monitor dolphins had been met with doubt, as many had argued there were no dolphins in the Slovenian sea. Now the dolphin population in the Gulf of Trieste is one of the most researched ones in the entire Mediterranean Sea.",human interest
Docu on babies abducted during WWII premieres in Frankfurt,"A documentary about Slovenian children who were kidnapped during the Second World War for the purpose of Germanisation had its world premiere in Frankfurt on Wednesday. Directed by acclaimed Slovenian director Maja Weiss, Snatched from the Source focuses on the stories of four babies who were part of the Nazi Lebensborn experiment.","The premiere was held at the German Film Institute and Film Museum as part of Slovenia's guest of honour appearance at the ongoing Frankfurt Book Fair.

Snatched from the Source - Slovenian Lebensborn Children is the first Slovenian feature-length documentary where archival footage was colourised. The decision to colourise black-and-white photographs and moving images taken from German, US and Slovenian archives serves as a warning that war is not a thing of the past.

The film was shot in Slovenia, Germany, Belgium and Costa Rica, where the four children later found themselves. Each one of their stories is complex and unique, showing the double nature of their suffering. Some of them lost their parents twice, Weiss told the STA.

Such tragedies should never happen again, but the film notes that they do, touching on child abductions during the war in Ukraine.

An anti-war film, the documentary also delves into the issue of identity and hidden stories that need to be told.

Inspired by one of her previous documentaries dealing with the same topic, Weiss wrote the script together with Nataša Konc Lorenzutti, who also penned a book about the stolen Slovenian children.

Those among the kidnapped children who returned to Slovenia after WWII were overlooked and marginalised as Germanised, said Konc Lorenzutti, adding that the film, which is due to be aired on RTV Slovenija at the end of next year, should inspire interest among the Germans too.

Ivan Acman, one of the four children who are in focus of Weiss's latest documentary, attended the premiere. Before the screening he told the STA he hopes the film will be a cautionary tale preventing such horrors from repeating themselves.

Later, visibly moved, he said he was lucky because he was adopted by a loving family, but the abduction caused him suffering too.

Ingrid Von Oelhafen, born as Erika Matko, was another of the four protagonists who attended the event. Georg Lilienthal, a German historian who spearheaded Lebensborn research, was also in attendance.

The Lebensborn programme was established by Heinrich Himmler, the chief architect of Holocaust, in 1935 with the aim of increasing the number of children who met the Nazi standards of ""racially pure"" Aryans, including by abducting babies.",human interest
Islamic Mufti underlines sanctity of life at Eid al-Adha prayer,"Slovenian Muslims started Eid al-Adha celebrations with morning prayer in the Ljubljana mosque on Wednesday. Mufti Nevzet Porić talked about the sanctity of life and underlined that euthanasia was forbidden in Islam, a comment on a bill drafted by an NGO advocating for a dignified old age that would introduce assisted suicide.","Human life is the most important value and people must take care of their health and dignity, and must respect and protect the lives of others.

""To take one's own or another's life by force is to defy the God's will and commandments,"" said Porić, adding that suicide was a mortal sin in Islam.

""Modern claims that the body belongs to me and I can do with it whatever I want are in complete contradiction with the Islamic understanding of this issue.""

""Euthanasia is a violation of ethical, legal, religious and medical codes. A medical procedure with the objective to end a life is unethical and a sin, even if it is performed upon the wish of the patient,"" Porić was adamant, but added it was allowed to end the life of a person when there is no hope for recovery.

The taking of a life cannot be justified with ""supposedly humane reasons and objectives to end suffering caused by a severe or incurable disease or due to a serious situation and temptation,"" said the Mufti.

Economic calculations are also ""outside the realm of reason"", because calculating a life from the aspect of economy is ""indecent and unacceptable"".

The four-day Eid al-Adha celebrations are the largest in Islam, linked closely to the Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Islamic community in Slovenia organised the pilgrimage this year, as well, taking 40 believers to Islam's holiest city.",human interest
Number of people in need of aid from Caritas up 10% in 2022,"Ten percent more people in need turned to Caritas Slovenia last year than in 2021, its secretary general Peter Tomažič told the press on Tuesday as the Catholic charity launched a campaign dubbed Let's Help Survive and Live.","The 2022 report on the charity's website shows that more than 143,000 persons benefited from one of its programmes, of whom over 26,700 children and 35,000 elderly people.

Food aid was provided to nearly 70,000 parents with children and individuals and nearly 730 homeless people, while Caritas also helped pay bills to 17,600 elderly people, a 17% rise.

A total of EUR 11.1 million was spent on aid programmes at home and another EUR 4.4 million on aid shipped abroad, of which EUR 3.3 million went to Ukraine, said Tomažič.

Many people would like to work but once they get a job they lose all the benefits and end up financially worse off than if unemployed, he added.

Tomažič would thus like employers to set a decent pay for a well done job as a standard rather than insisting on the minimum wage.

Alenka Petek, a social worker from Caritas Ljubljana, said having a job used to be a way out of poverty, which is no longer the case.

An increasingly large number of families where both parents work turn to them for help as they find it hard to make ends meet due to high commercial rents.

Many of them apply for public rental housing but with the shortage of public homes for rent few are awarded one.

Janez Kastelic from Caritas Domžale said many people in need are afraid to ask for aid due to social stigma.

Immigrants and refugees also have a hard time, especially as they struggle with basic language skills, said Petek.

Many elderly people are also struggling on their low pensions, especially amid high inflation, and they are also socially excluded as their circle of friends is narrowing.

""They worked hard all their lives, but now they are dependent on humanitarian organisations, which often makes them feel very humiliated,"" she added.

Caritas tries to help people who are just below eligibility for other forms of state-provided aid or allowances, Tomažič said. Many of them have decent incomes, but struggle to survive because of debt, illness or other circumstances.

And with the prices of food, housing and other necessities further rising, the situation is not improving, he said.",human interest
"Slovenia pledges EUR 80,000 for Venezuelan refugees","Slovenia has pledged to donate EUR 80,000 over two years for Venezuelan refugees staying in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru at the International Conference on Solidarity with Venezuelan Refugees and Migrants, which concluded in Brussels on Friday.","Foreign Ministry State Secretary Samuel Žbogar thanked the organisers of the conference and stressed the importance of solidarity in long crises such as the crisis in Venezuela, the Foreign Ministry said.

Slovenia has been providing humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people since 2019. The same year, it launched a repatriation programme for Venezuelan nationals of Slovenian descent as part of which over 100 people have been brought to Slovenia.

"Archbishop calls for helping those affected by floods, condemns euthanasia",Ljubljana Archbishop Stanislav Zore urged people to show solidarity with those affected by the floods and warned against euthanasia as he delivered a sermon at the Basilica of St. Mary Help of Christians to mark the Feast of the Assumption.,"He said today's holiday is needed for several reasons, primarily because of the distress that ""we have experienced in recent days and that many are still experiencing"". It seemed that a ""dragon was let loose in nature threatening to eat everything that got into its way"".

He said many had resorted to payers but some also gave in to despair. ""Some died in this rampage ... Others lost the roof over their head, everything they have created in decades,"" he said, urging everyone to stand by them not only in these first few days but until they are able to live in peace on their own again,"" Zore said.

""Human sight has narrowed dangerously. People more or less see what benefits them and confirms them in the deceitful thoughts of their heart. They themselves have become the measure of all. They themselves determine who is worthy of life and who is not. They themselves determine who should be allowed to be born and also increasingly seek to determine when life should end because it is no longer worth living,"" Zore said.

He added that this human self does not want its desires to be perceived by anyone as selfish, inhumane, pre-civilisational and pre-Christian. ""That is why these selfish criteria are wrapped up in the beautiful and sonorous words of personal autonomy, the right to make decisions about oneself and one's body and, lastly, the right to end one's life in order to put an end to horrible or unbearable suffering,"" he said.

Although such thinking and acting is inhumane, pre-civilisational and un-Christian, it nevertheless awakens compassion in people, often even in Christians. ""In this, we remain supremely naive. We think only of the physical suffering of terminal illness. And often this suffering is not the worst. It is the suffering of the soul that is much more difficult,"" he said, explaining that older people suffer unbearably from the feeling of being superfluous and that God never saw any person that way.

Some 4,000 people attended today's main mass in Brezje, according to the head of the Brezje office Andreja Eržen Firšt, while at least 10,000 people are expected at the pilgrimage site throughout the day. This is no less that last year, despite the devastation in most parts of the country, she said.

The head of the pilgrimage site, Robert Bahčič, said that pilgrims from the Savinja Valley and other flood-affected areas had arrived already on Monday to express their gratitude for all the help they have been receiving and ask for more help. ""We see a lot of tears of sadness but also tears of joy that people have come to the rescue,"" Bahčič said.

The day after the floods, he and others from the Franciscan Monastery of Brezje, the local pilgrimage office and the charity Order of Malta, went to Solčava to help.

The renovation work on the bell tower of the Basilica of St. Mary Help of Christians was suspended so that the workers and their machinery could go to the flood affected areas. ""We helped in Solčava until Wednesday and saw what a disaster it is when you lose everything in five, ten minutes, and that it takes many hands to help,"" said Bahčič.

""Many have lost everything, but they have not lost hope,"" he stressed, adding that at every holy mass at Brezje they also pray for those affected and those who are helping them. The money collected during masses in all parishes across the country last Sunday, will be donated to those affected by the storm. In Brezje, almost 13,900 euros were collected.",human interest
Slovenia stepping up intl humanitarian aid with memorandums,Slovenia signed on Monday special cooperation agreements with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) in an effort to further the effectiveness of humanitarian and development assistance provided by the country.,"Both documents were signed on the sidelines of the 11th Slovenian Development Days in Ljubljana, dedicated to the country's response to crises and humanitarian hotspots worldwide.

The humanitarian aid provision memorandum with the ICRC, signed by ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric Egger and Foreign Ministry State Secretary Sanja Štiglic, seeks to ensure predictable and effective assistance worldwide and strengthen cooperation in key priority areas for Slovenian humanitarian aid efforts.

The agreement provides, among other things, for the involvement of Slovenian experts in the organisation's activities, exchange of expertise, study visits and joint missions. The memorandum foresees a humanitarian contribution from Slovenia of EUR 2 million over the period 2023-2025.

The ICRC, whose head was also received in Ljubljana by President Nataša Pirc Musar, has been an important partner for Slovenia when it comes to providing emergency response in crises around the world.

In response to growing needs, Slovenia has stepped up its humanitarian efforts through the ICRC over the past year, providing emergency assistance in some the biggest crises, such as Ukraine, Sudan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria, the Foreign Ministry said in a press release.

Meanwhile, State Secretary Štiglic also signed with GIZ regional director for Ukraine Danielo Busche a memorandum on cooperation between the ministry and the GIZ implementing agency under the U-LEAD programme. The German development agency's programme supports Ukraine in implementing reforms and moving towards European standards in the field of decentralisation.

Through the Centre for European Perspective (CEP), a Slovenian governmental organisation, Slovenia will fund training projects or study visits for Ukrainian local and regional government representatives.

The aim is to transfer Slovenia's knowledge and experience in municipal governance in a wide range of areas - from the role of civil society, rural development, building public infrastructure to environmental protection.",human interest
Golob: Protection of civilians more important than ceasefire terminology,"Protecting civilians in the Middle East is more important than how to technically call a ceasefire, PM Robert Golob said as he arrived at the EU summit in Brussels where EU leaders are discussing the crisis in the Middle East. He believes a clear stance must be taken to protect civilians on both sides and to establish humanitarian corridors.","He expects today's discussion to revolve around whether the EU should urge Israel and Hamas to a humanitarian ceasefire.

Given the latest draft conclusions, the leaders are to call for humanitarian breaks to enable delivery of humanitarian aid, rather than for humanitarian ceasefire.

""I think the word as such is less important. What is important is to protect civilians, and we will insist on this. We will insist that a clear position be taken as soon as possible, which is today, that civilians on both sides must be protected, that humanitarian corridors must be established,"" said Golob, adding that key infrastructure, such as hospitals and humanitarian infrastructure, should also be protected.

All sides must be called upon to respect international humanitarian law, he said. ""I think this is a point from which we mustn't detour.""

As for criticism that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not urge respect for international humanitarian law in her first reactions to the crisis, Golob said she will have an opportunity to explain her positions today, and urged the EU's unity.

""Today we're all striving for unity, and I believe that we'll try to maintain this unity, so I would rather look at today than at the past,"" he said, adding the Union should also be united in making efforts for the conflict not to spread through the region.",human interest
Slovenian opposition MP visiting Israel,"MP Jernej Vrtovec, a member of the opposition New Slovenia - Christian Democrats (NSi), joined a delegation of around 15 MPs from various EU countries and MEPs who are on a three-day visit to Israel to learn more about the situation after the terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.","Vrtovec, who is the chair of the NSi's council, said on X on Monday that the delegation had met today as part of a ""solidarity mission"" with the relatives of the hostages Hamas took on the day of the attack.

The visit is organised by the European Leadership Network (ELNET), an NGO working to strengthen Europe-Israel relations.

When the Slovenian parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee discussed Hamas's attack on 11 October, Vrtovec labelled it as a barbaric and treacherous act, while saying that Hamas enjoys Iran's support. He accused the Islamist group of abusing people in Gaza as a live shield, which he said made Israel's response justified.",human interest
Dolphins take the spotlight in Piran,"Dolphin Day will be held in Piran on Saturday, aiming to present research and conservation efforts as well as to raise public awareness about these marine mammals living in the northern Adriatic Sea, especially the bottlenose dolphin, the most common dolphin species in the Slovenian waters.","The event, organized annually by the marine mammal association Morigenos since 2004, will be held for the 16th year, and is geared toward shedding light on the life of dolphins and highlighting the importance of the entire marine ecosystem.

The association has studied and monitored dolphins in Slovenian waters since 2002, and also conducts research in Italy and Croatia.

It wants to provide a scientific basis for effective protection of dolphins and their habitat, Morigenos said, adding they believe that by protecting dolphins we can also better protect the marine ecosystem, on which humans depend as well.

The Slovenia, Croatian and Italian waters in the north Adriatic are a vital habitat to the common bottlenose dolphin population, the only permanent species of cetacean in Slovenia, while others are only spotted occasionally.

The existence of dolphins in Slovenia is under threat from many human impacts, such as pollution, noise, heavy maritime traffic, excessive or inappropriate fishing, and the general degradation of the sea and its coastline, the association pointed out.

Dolphin Day will offer an array of fun educational activities where visitors will be able to learn about the world of dolphins, have a go at different research methods, try their luck in a prize quiz or stroll through Morigenos' Dolphin Education and Research Centre, which opened in January. A treasure hunt will be organised for children.",human interest
Humanitarian forum stresses importance of international solidarity,"President Nataša Pirc Musar stressed the importance of international solidarity in efforts to meet global challenges as she opened the first Slovenian humanitarian forum, which coincides with the Slovenian Development Days. She would like to see the forum bring into focus the role of forging new partnerships and implementing the commitments.","""The international donor community is currently faced with the need to provide emergency assistance to more than 363 million people around the world who have found themselves in the midst of humanitarian crises.

""Unfortunately, only half of the necessary funding is provided on annual level, which means that more than 180 million people are still without the urgently needed assistance,"" the president told the forum on Monday as quoted in her office's press release.

""Countries can join forces through international solidarity to tackle problems that are not purely humanitarian, such as climate change, poverty, famine and migration. Solidarity is a fundamental value both at home and in the international community that leads to peace, stability and justice.""

Pirc Musar also recalled the experience of the August floods in Slovenia, which brought devastation but also outpourings of solidarity and assistance.

Her wish is for the humanitarian forum to stress the importance of efforts to strengthen solidarity, make humanitarian action more effective, forge new partnerships and put into practice the commitments on solidarity.

As part of the event the president received Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

Slovenia signed special cooperation agreements with the ICRC and the German agency for international cooperation GIZ today in an effort to further the effectiveness of its humanitarian and development assistance.

Dnevnik praises solidarity among people and criticises govt,"The newspaper Dnevnik praises solidarity among Slovenians in its commentary on Wednesday, but is critical of the government's decision to make Monday a work-free day so that people would be able to help with flood relief.","People have been providing invaluable aid ever since the start of the floods. Once again, Slovenians have shown extraordinary solidarity, Dnevnik says.

It would be interesting to research where this solidarity comes from. ""Maybe it is because there are so many remote hamlets around the country where people can truly only count on their neighbours. Maybe it has also something to do with the fact that we lived in socialism for a few decades.""

The idea of making 14 August a work-free day, bridging the weekend with the work free Assumption of Mary on Tuesday, first surfaced on Facebook, the paper says. ""It seems almost bizarre that it has become reality.""

The intention is good, but the implementation is rather populist. The government's decision just gifted Slovenians with a long weekend. ""The weather will be nice, the sea is warm,"" no matter how enthusiastic Prime Minister Robert Golob is about Monday being the day for the entire country to step together.

If Golob thinks that all 926,700 people in employment will go help in flood-stricken areas, he is naive, to put it mildly, the paper says. ""A government decree can be adopted in a flash, but solidarity cannot be enforced by law.""

And even if all those people went to help, would that be a government-coordinated effort or chaotic self-management, the paper wonders.

It is also critical of the idea to give up to seven days of paid leave to public servants if they volunteer, saying it is reminiscent of several ideas that had been announced but later abandoned by the government in the past.

But this does not change the fact that many Slovenians are already helping, no matter what the government decrees. ""So where will you be on 14 August?"" the paper asks in the commentary with the same headline.",human interest
Slovenia announces cooperation on artificial intelligence within CoE,"Minister for Digital Transformation Emilija Stojmenova Duh and Kristian Bartholin, head of the digital development unit and secretary to the committee on artificial intelligence of the Council of Europe (CoE), discussed efforts to strengthen cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI). Bartholin welcomed Slovenia's being set on active cooperation.","The minister informed Bartholin of Slovenia's artificial intelligence activities and announced that the country would organise a global forum on ethics of artificial intelligence at the end of the year, her ministry said after the meeting that was held in Ljubljana on Tuesday.

She is hopeful that CoE representatives will take part in the event.

Slovenia aims to be as actively involved in artificial intelligence activities within the Council of Europe as possible with the UNESCO-sponsored International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence in Ljubljana, digital innovation hubs and Slovenian researchers expected to be at the forefront of these efforts.

Stojmenova Duh noted that Slovenia's position on the principles of the use of artificial intelligence was very close to the Council of Europe's view on this, as both of them put human rights before private business interests.

""Slovenia also advocates that AI should be designed with ethical principles in mind, rather than setting legal frameworks in parallel with development.

""Moreover, the country has drawn up a statement on AI launching a broad societal debate on the development and impact of this technology that will involve private sector companies, NGOs, institutes and the National Assembly,"" the minister said, adding that once Slovenia had adopted the joint statement, it would unveil it to the international community.

Bartholin welcomed the announcement that Slovenia will be more active in this area within the Council of Europe, thanking the country for its efforts so far.

He is hopeful that other CoE members will follow suit. ""If we want to have an impact, we need to get as many countries in the international community on our side as possible,"" he said, adding that the West should help developing countries in their AI efforts.

If this help is not provided a technological vacuum will be created for other countries and private companies where respect for human rights in the development of artificial intelligence is not high on the agenda.

The pair also talked about the year of digital citizenship 2025 and Slovenia's potential contribution to the project.",human interest
Špela Stres acting head of new science and innovation agency,"The government has appointed Špela Stres acting director of the Agency for Research and Innovation in Science (ARIS) after it formally founded the organisation last week as a legal successor to the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS).

ReCatalyst wins Startup of the Year Award,"ReCatalyst, a company which has developed a next-generation hydrogen fuel cell catalyst, was declared the winner of this year's Startup of the Year Award at a ceremony on Tuesday. Its innovative solution helps markedly reduce production costs while also being more environmentally friendly.","Start:up Slovenija, the organisation that gives out the award in cooperation with the Slovenian Enterprise Fund and the Economy Ministry praised the company for contributing to decarbonisation, which it said was a global challenge for the transport and energy sectors and called for concrete measures.

Hydrogen fuel cells are one of the alternatives to fossil fuels and internal combustion engines but their mass production is closely tied to using critical materials, such as platinum, which is found in fuel cell catalysts.

The catalyst, which looks like black powder, is a key component that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity in a fuel cell, with water as the only by-product.

""ReCatalyst develops, manufactures and sells next-generation catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells. Its production is based on a patented process, in which platinum, a high-cost and rare material, is used more efficiently and is partly also replaced by cheaper and more available metals.""

Currently, the company's product already achieves a platinum reduction of more than 40%, without sacrificing the capacity potential of the fuel cell, Start:up Slovenija said.

As the hydrogen technology market is growing rapidly, ReCatalyst holds great potential, the organizers said.

""ReCatalyst is already testing its technology with some of the biggest names in the industry... Its technology platform allows for expansion to other types of catalysts too, such as electrolysis for hydrogen production, and to other similar materials facing the need to make better use of precious metals.""

The other four companies shortlisted for the award were the physical fitness app Gentler Stories, Paradigma Technologies, a maker of high frequency radio telecommunication systems for small satellites and drones, management diagnostic tools maker Quantifly, and Woice, a developer of an audio messaging tool for teams that works without notifications and in different time zones.",science and technology

Her journalistic work includes interviews and in-depth stories on topics ranging from medicine, astrophysics, technology, energy, neuroscience, environment, biology to history, geography and gender.

She has interviewed some of the most prominent names in science, including Nobel Prize laureates Stanley Whittingham, John C. Mather, and Rainer Weiss, Vinton Cerf, dubbed the ""father of the Internet"", and astronaut Chris Hadfield.

Udovč was nominated for the award also in 2018 and in the same year she received the Watchdog Award for best young journalist given out by the Slovenian Association of Journalists.

She is also a guest lecturer at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana and at the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School.

The European Science Journalist of the Year Award was established in 2014 by the Association of British Science Writers, and since 2020 it has been handed out annually by the European Federation for Science Journalism with the support of the global information and analytics provider Elsevier.

As journalists from all over Europe are nominated by local science journalism associations and individuals, Udovč was nominated by the Balkan Network of Science Journalists.

Slovenia's innovation performance remains unchanged,"Slovenia's innovation performance remains unchanged compared with the year before, with the country ranking 14th among EU countries and keeping its spot in the moderate innovators group, shows the 2023 European Innovation Scoreboard released by the European Commission on Thursday.","In the group of moderate innovators, Slovenia is joined by Estonia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, Malta, Portugal, Lithuania, Greece and a newcomer to the group, Hungary.

Denmark placed first in the innovation leaders group, outperforming the long-standing top innovator Sweden, which ranked second this time, followed by Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands.

Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, Cyprus and France fared above the EU average, which makes them strong innovators. Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania remain in the emerging innovators group.

This year's scoreboard is based on the same indicator framework as last year's edition and consists of 32 indicators grouped under 12 dimensions. It takes into account the pros and cons of innovation system in EU member states.

Between 2016 and 2023, innovation performance in the EU has increased by 8.5%, the European Commission's report finds, with Slovenia lagging behind quite substantially as it only recorded a 2.9% growth. This means the country's performance gap to the EU is becoming larger. Cyprus recoded the biggest performance boost out of all EU countries with +35.6%.

Switzerland, a non-EU member, remains the top-ranking innovation leader in Europe. In a global comparison, the EU ranks behind South Korea, Canada, the US and Australia. Japan and China's performances are almost at a par with the EU but both countries have lagged far behind in recent years.

In the latest edition, member states and their regions have, on average, managed to better their innovation performance despite global crises, the report said.",science and technology

"Govt, business, and education and research sectors sign innovation cooperation deal","Top representatives of the government, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS) and the education and research sectors signed Tuesday an agreement on strategic cooperation for technological development and an innovation breakthrough. Only through knowledge and joint action will the country's development be achieved, was the event's main message.","The agreement, called For a Smart, Sustainable and Competitive Slovenia, was signed at the GZS by PM Robert Golob, GZS president Tibor Šimonka, University of Ljubljana rector and head of the Slovenian Rectors' Conference Gregor Majdič, and the director of the National Institute of Chemistry and head of the Coordination of Independent Institutes Gregor Anderluh.

The strategic objectives set out include increasing total public and private spending on science, research, development and innovation to at least 2.8% of GDP by 2027, with public spending reaching at least 1% of GDP and private spending at least 1.8% of GDP, with a view to a further increase after 2027.

The goals moreover include improving the research, innovation and business environment, cutting red tape, and securing tax relief for R&D. Also mentioned is more focus on the training of top-tier staff to enable the expansion of research, development and innovation in universities, research institutions with stable funding, as well as in business and public administration.

The signatories promise to strengthen the implementation of strategic documents in R&D and to co-finance the establishment of pilot centres and demonstration facilities, as well as to accelerate the integration of research organisations, the higher education system and the economy.

Another commitment aims for an effective new Agency for Scientific Research and Innovation and additional funding for its operations, not only by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation. A special fund and other mechanisms to finance all development stages at innovative companies are planned as well.

The GZS's Šimonka said on the occasion that innovation was the key to increasing added value in the economy. The signatories believe that the average value added can be raised from the current EUR 58,000 to EUR 88,000 by 2030. To achieve this, investment in R&D must be stepped up and the interests of all stakeholders must be aligned, Šimonka said.

While Šimonka is confident the specific goals listed will prevent the agreement from being dead ink on paper, PM Golob pointed to election promises that hailed added value as the only path towards more prosperity. He sees the occasion as the first step in politics joining the other three segments of society on this journey.

He is pleased that the ambition to increase added value is coming from businesses, and he believes even EUR 100,000 is not out of reach.

Rector Majdič argued universities should be integrated into the environment, both domestic and international, and should guide the development of the country and the economy. The challenges that lie ahead, such as the green transition, digitisation, robotics and AI, can only be met and turned to our advantage with knowledge and a multidisciplinary approach, he noted.

Quantity of active ingredients in pesticides sold down 9%,"The plant protection products sold in Slovenia in 2022 contained around 847 tonnes of active ingredients. This is 9.1% less than in 2021, 14% below a five-year average, and the smallest annual amount of active ingredients in the plant protection products sold in the last ten years.","Compared to 2021, the amount of active ingredients sold fell last year in five of the six main groups of plant protection products, the Statistics Office said.

It decreased by 6% for fungicides and bactericides, by 14.4% for herbicides, by 20.4% for insecticides and acaricides, by 48.6% in molluscicides, and by 54% in plant growth regulators.

It, meanwhile, increased in the group plant protection products, which includes rodenticides, oils and substances for soil sterilisation. The growth of the amount of active ingredients in this group compared to 2021 was 59.9%.

In what is a multi-year trend, the largest quantity of active ingredients was sold with fungicides (628 tonnes), with inorganic sulphur accounting for 336 tonnes and phthalimide-based fungicides 112 tonnes.",science and technology
Strategic partnership launches innovative processing of biomass,"Circular Economy, a strategic development and innovation partnership, and the company Helios TBLUS presented a pilot project in which a reactor system will be used for innovative processing of biomass into bio-based resins and coatings. The equipment will be available to all partners in the project and to other companies, they said on Tuesday.","As part of the joint project of transferring technology from lab-scale to pilot-scale, research equipment for the optimisation and transfer of innovative technology based on sustainable resource management will be used in practice in the industry, the Štajerska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which manages the Circular Economy, said.

Waste biomass from the wood and agricultural industries will be used as feedstock for the products. The Institute of Chemistry is in charge of the development part of the project, while the equipment will be available not only to partners in the project but also to other companies.

""Increasing the use of bio-based materials will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the polymer industry and enable the production of environmentally and human-friendly products,"" the partners believe.

The whole investment is worth EUR 323,000, with the state covering half of the costs and the partners in the project the other half.

""Progress in science and technology enables the development of high-quality products that are environmentally friendly and comply with strict Slovenian and EU environmental legislation. We see our participation in the partnership as an important competitive advantage in Europe's demanding markets,"" said Helios TBLUS CEO Peter Venturini.

Head of the Štajerska Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aleksandra Podgornik said that in the face of climate change and other challenges circular activities were essential for the future of business.

""Companies that adopted sustainability visions years ago are now more competitive and perform better. We need comprehensive and revolutionary change, which requires broad alliances and collaborations such as the ones we are successfully developing in the Circular Economy,"" she added.

The Circular Economy and the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the University of Maribor will host a conference on the technologies and business models for circular economy in Portorož between 6 and 8 September. Some 150 participants are expected to attend, including researchers, business executives and state institutions.",science and technology
Slovenia and US sign new nuclear safety accord,The Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission signed a new bilateral agreement on Tuesday to exchange technical information and cooperate in research and training of experts.,"The agreement, following the first such signed in 1993, was signed on the sidelines of a meeting of contracting parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in Vienna by Igor Sirc, director of the Slovenian administration, and NRC chair Christopher T. Hanson, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning said.

The agreement reaffirms the countries' commitment to exchange technical information, to cooperate in nuclear safety research, to provide training and experience for experts and to cooperate in potential emergency events.

The release notes that US companies are suppliers for the reactor and related equipment for the Krško Nuclear Power Station (NEK) as well as the research reactor of the Jožef Stefan Institute at Dol near Ljubljana.

The bilateral agreement is deemed of ""exceptional importance for the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration, providing it with direct contact with the authority of the country of manufacture of the mentioned reactors and related systems"".

The agreement was signed as part of a review meeting of the parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The countries parties to the convention operating civil nuclear power plants have committed to respect fundamental principles to maintain a high level of nuclear safety.

Slovenia has been a party to the Convention since 1996.

Apart from the Nuclear Safety Administration, the Slovenian delegation to the meeting also includes representatives of the Slovenian permanent mission to Vienna and NEK.

After making a national presentation focusing on the safe operation of NEK, the delegation will also attend presentations of some other countries.

These are selected taking into account the importance of the country in terms of the number of reactors and technology, the proximity of the country, countries with which Slovenia has bilateral agreements, and other countries of interest due to their technology, advanced approach, and the rapid growth of the nuclear energy sector.

The meeting in Vienna is running from 20 to 31 March.",science and technology
Litostroj scores record contract at hydropower plant in Canada,"Litostroj Power Group, A Ljubljana-based Czech-owned company, will supply eight generation units to the Pointe du Bois hydropower station in Manitoba, Canada.

The subsidiary Litostroj Engineering, based in Blansko in the Czech Republic, will develop the hydraulic turbine, which will be produced in Ljubljana by Litostroj Power.

Pointe du Bois is a run-of-the-river plant on the Winnipeg River. Litostroj will supply a total of 16 Francis turbines to the plant with a joint power of 78 megawatts.

The aim of the upgrade is to increase the plant's reliability and production capacity and extend its lifespan to at least 2055. The plant will produce an additional 380 gigawatt hours of electricity and supply 35,000 households.",science and technology
Chemistry Institute spearheading EUR 6m multiscale simulation project,"A new multiscale simulation project is up and running under the leadership of the National Institute of Chemistry, which will aim to build a research ecosystem for supercomputing and accelerate the transition to supercomputing resources. The MultiXscale Centre of Excellence involves 13 partners from academia and industry across Europe.","The project, as part of which code will be developed to allow supercumputers to execute multiscale simulations, was set up within the framework of the EuroHPC, a joint European initiative for European High-Performance Computing.

Worth over EUR 6 million in total, the project comprises eight supercomputers located across Europe, one of which is the Vega supercomputer in Maribor.

The main objective is to increase performance, productivity and portability across the full spectrum of science and engineering where multiscale simulations are performed, the press heard in Ljubljana on Thursday.

Matej Praprotnik, the project's chief coordinator, explained that current applications require adaptations and that scientists presently lack the computational expertise to be able to harness the power of the supercomputers to come.

With the help of the centre, smaller groups of scientists, such as the 40-strong theoretical department at the National Institute of Chemistry, will come together to jointly develop code for this community, Praprotnik said.

Thus, MultiXscale will facilitate the transition to supercomputing resources for scientists and industrial users working in multiscale modelling.

Application developers will be able to drive domain-relevant scientific innovation without being overwhelmed by technical details, while industrial and academic application users will be able to effortlessly deploy leading-edge technologies on any computing resources they have access to.

To drive library and service development and demonstrate the scientific and industrial potential of true multiscale approaches, MultiXscale will pursue three pilot use cases of societal and industrial importance.

These are helicopter design and certification for civil transportation, battery applications to support the sustainable energy transition, and ultrasound for non-invasive diagnostics and biomedical applications.",science and technology
Hisense Europe to open R&D centre in Velenje,"The Chinese-owned group Hisense Europe, which includes Velenje-based household appliances maker Gorenje, will open a new innovation centre in Velenje on Monday. The R&D centre will develop household appliances for the European market and kitchen and premium appliances for the global market.","This will mean that the group will develop technologies and appliances in Velenje, no matter where the appliances will be produced and for which market, Hisense Europe wrote in the invitation to the event.

The R&D centre has been in the works for a long time. With it, Hisense is further strengthening the importance of Slovenia as a European production and development hub, which brings new investments and job posts, the company wrote.

Hisense Europe has business units in 27 European countries along with three production and four R&D centres. The group considers R&D one of the key pillars of the company's development and is willing to invest a lot of money. Last year there were talks of EUR 50 million invested. The group has also hired more technological staff.

Besides Velenje, Hisense Europe has been conducting R&D activities in two other Slovenian cities, Ljubljana and Maribor.

Hisense acquired Gorenje in 2018 when the company bought more than 95% of Gorenje shares in two months in a takeover bid that set the value of Gorenje to EUR 293 million.",science and technology
"Debate notes benefits afforded by AI rise, along with need for caution","Participants of a conference on the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rapid progress of AI models, stressed in Ljubljana on Tuesday the need to harness the advantages of this technology while minimising risks. They noted the key role that knowledge will play in preventing people falling victim to AI.","Digital Transformation Minister Emilija Stojmenova Duh highlighted at the Artificial Intelligence: Revolution or Evolution? event the necessity of leveraging new technologies and tools that bring numerous benefits.

She stressed the importance of raising awareness about the risks involved, while criticising the prevailing discourse in Europe that expects the destruction of humanity by these new technologies.

The debate, held as part of the Chemistry Institute Digital Transformation Week, also heard professor Polona Domadenik from the School of Economics and Business in Ljubljana note that ""we, as a society, face a crucial challenge in educating people on how to use these new technologies"".

She said companies adopted new technologies in the pursuit of efficiency, while she also urged carefully assessing which areas require these technologies and accurately measuring the effects.

Professor Smiljana Gartner from the faculties of arts and education in Maribor also spoke of the need for a right balance that involves caution. A vast amount of knowledge will be needed to properly assess these technologies, she said, stressing the importance of providing appropriate education to both children and teachers.

Alenka Krapež, the principal of the Ljubljana Vič Grammar School in Ljubljana, agreed about the need for a proper level of IT knowledge to enable smart use, while arguing that fundamental forms of knowledge were even more important. ""Every chemist is first and foremost a chemist; they use tools when they need them.""

Without knowledge, people will be unable to distinguish what is true from what is not, as the danger of digitalisation lies in the flood of half-truths and even lies, Krapež added.

At the School of Economics and Business, they do not prohibit students from using ChatGPT, but new guidelines for writing papers have been established to ensure that ChatGPT cannot be the author, Domadenik explained. Instead, it can be considered a method, and the author of the paper must provide detailed information on how it was utilised.

The need to make use of the various new AI models was also noted by Marko Robnik Šikonja, a professor from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana, who argued that those failing to do so will no longer be competitive.

Nejc Robida from the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana spoke about ongoing efforts to acquire as much Slovenian language material as possible to improve the existing models when it comes to Slovenian.

""Corporate interests are not as strong for languages like Slovenian, so we need to take care of this infrastructure ourselves. We strive to take the initiative to provide researchers and companies with opportunities to develop these tools based on quality resources,"" he explained while highlighting funding challenges.",science and technology
Slovenia discussing CERN full membership in Geneva,"State secretary at the Ministry for Higher Education, Science and Innovation Jure Gašparič is taking part in a regular meeting of the council of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) held in Geneva on Thursday. According to the ministry, the meeting is an opportunity to discuss Slovenia's full membership of CERN.","Slovenia is currently still an associate member of CERN, but is expected to become a full member in July next year, which is to bring even more research opportunities for Slovenian students, researchers and companies, the ministry said in a press release.

""This meeting is an opportunity to exchange views and opinions with CERN representatives on the process, conditions and criteria that Slovenia needs to fulfil before becoming a full member. As part of this process, Slovenia is planning to hold a bilateral meeting between the government and CERN representatives this autumn,"" the ministry said.

Gašparič will present at the meeting recent changes and innovations in the Slovenian research and innovation space, which will be reflected in the country's future cooperation with CERN.

These include the creation of a single ministry responsible for higher education, science and innovation, the establishment of a single agency for research and innovation activities, the adoption of a regulation and action plan in open science, a strategy for the internationalisation of higher education and science, and a plan for the development of research infrastructure.",science and technology

Primorske Novice takes issue with changes to the Religious Freedom Act,"Commenting on the changes to the Religious Freedom Act that lowers the state coverage of social contributions for religious workers, which were passed last week and will leave EUR 1.7 million in the budget, Primorske Novice says on Monday that this is not about money but ideology.","""It's not about money, of course not. It is about the cultural battle between the left and right, because whenever the Church is in the equation, things become attractive for dividing the public and diverting attention,"" the newspaper says.

""With the proposal that was drafted by the Culture Ministry, endorsed by the government and passed by coalition MP, religious communities were badly abused.

""Not only was their staff - most of those whom the state finances contributions are from the Catholic Church - left without almost half of their contributions in the middle of the year, but the larger religious communities lost their status of an organisation useful to the general public, even though they carry out important charitable work and preserve cultural heritage.""

There could be debate on how to amend the Religious Freedom Act, regulate the tax status of religious communities, and perhaps even introduce a tax paid by members of religious communities, Primorske Novice says.

Changes can also be fair, and dialogue among all those involved is expected when the status of religious communities is discussed in democratic countries. ""In the case of the Catholic Church, there is even an agreement between Slovenia and the Holy See that says that the parties will endeavour to resolve outstanding issues in dialogue.""

But there was no dialogue this time. The coalition pushed the amendments through without any prior discussion with the religious communities, the public debate was extremely short, the National Assembly adopted the law in a fast-track procedure, and there was no explanation of the reasons for the amendments, Primorske Novice says.

No wonder the larger religious communities got the impression that they are not treated as equals in this society and that this may had been the main goal of the changes, reads the commentary Religious Communities Good for Nothing?",religion and belief
New York priest Krizolog celebrates Golden Jubilee with US Slovenians,"Father Martin Krizolog, the priest who has been heading the parish Church of St Cyril, a Slovenian church in New York, for more than three decades, has recently celebrated his Golden Jubilee in the company of more than a hundred Slovenians in Pennsylvania.","Krizolog has been heading the church in East Village, Manhattan, which was founded in 1916 and is still the spiritual and cultural centre for Slovenians in New York, since 1992.

Mija Branc, who has been hosting the traditional Slovenian ""picnic mass"" in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania since 1996, said that Krizolog was like a ""magnet"" who attracted even those who were not regular churchgoers, and that he had a ""certain charisma"".

Krizolog, who held his first mass in Slovenia 50 years ago, is happy he has ""chosen this calling. I never got bored because I like to be with people. This is what makes me happy and I will carry on until I go to the happy hunting grounds.""

Having worked as a priest in the US for 31 years, the Franciscan says that in a country where there were over a thousand religions, one learned about tolerance and respect for fellow human beings.

""This is what gives me great satisfaction and it is also about the mission of a priest - to be respectful and patient with each other,"" he added.

The ""golden mass"" was attended by a delegation from the Slovenian Embassy in Washington, and the Slovenian ambassador to the UN, Boštjan Malovrh, who came from New York.

After the mass, Krizolog called for donations to the victims of the recent floods in Slovenia and the fires on the Hawaiian island of Maui.

The picnic that followed the mass featured Slovenian traditional dishes, including the ričet stew, and was attended by Slovenians from New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and also from Slovenia.",religion and belief
New restrictions in place for disgraced Slovenian Jesuit,"The Jesuit order has decided to prohibit Slovenian priest Marko Rupnik from pursuing his artistic activity after 15 more people, women as well as men, came forward with fresh accusations against him of spiritual, sexual and psychological abuse.","In a report published on Tuesday morning, Johan Verschueren, Rupnik's superior in the religious order, said that a number of people who do not know each other had come forward with similar accusations against the priest, which led to the conclusion that the allegations were ""very credible"".

As a precautionary measure, the order has tightened the restrictive rules against Rupnik by banning him from any public artistic exercise, particularly in relation to religious structures.

These new restrictions are in addition to those already in place, including a ban on any public ministerial and sacramental activity, a ban on public communication, and a ban on leaving the Lazio Region.

The Rupnik scandal, which first came to light at the end of last year, has rocked the Jesuit order and the entire Catholic Church given that Pope Francis is a member of the order.

Rupnik has not spoken publicly about the accusations and Verschueren said in his latest update that he has declined to meet Jesuit investigators.

An artist specialising in mosaics, Rupnik rose to prominence when the late Pope John Paul II commissioned him to redesign a chapel in the Vatican between 1996 to 1999. He has since designed numerous chapels around the world.

Father Rupnik's misconduct took place between the mid-1980s and 2018, according to the latest testimony by victims.",religion and belief
Ombudsman and mufti stress importance of freedom of religion (adds),"Human Rights Ombudsman Peter Svetina received the Mufti of the Islamic Community in Slovenia, Nevzet Porić, in Ljubljana on Wednesday. The pair discussed the importance of respecting the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and Porić praised the Ombudsman's Office as a unique ally in the implementation of the rights of religious communities.","""The freedom of religious expression and the religious feelings and beliefs of all individuals and members of religious communities must be respected, regardless of whether they are Islamic, Christian, Jewish or any other faith,"" Svetina stressed.

The ombudsman has consistently been issuing warnings about unacceptable practices in society affecting religious communities, such as various forms of intolerance in public speech or the desecration of religious symbols, the Ombudsman's Office wrote.

The ombudsman moreover noted that the search for the limits of freedom of conscience and the functioning of religious communities remains topical in contemporary Slovenian society. It is also often shown that these are issues which, in their essence, go beyond the national level and are also encountered, to a greater or lesser extent, in other parts of the world.

Porić briefed Svetina on the current human rights situation in the context of the Islamic community in Slovenia. He pointed out that this is a minority community whose members have been subjected to hate speech and hate crimes on several occasions in the past. However, Porić feels that the current situation is satisfactory, with fewer such cases being recorded.

The mufti also highlighted problems related to the status of imams who do not have Slovenian citizenship and the regulation of their status as religious officials. The ombudsman promised to look into the situation and help resolve the issue.

On the issue of circumcision, Porić asked the ombudsman to revise the Ombudsman Office's 2012 opinion that that circumcision for non-medical reasons is a violation of children's rights. The mufti said this caused many problems in the circumcision of boys and Svetina promised to look into the matter again.

The pair agreed it is very important to build bridges between people of different nations, cultures and religions. They said inter-religious dialogue between religious communities in Slovenia is very important for positive coexistence and understanding between people, the press release published on the website of the Islamic Community added.

Svetina and Porić also touched on the developments during the Covid-19 pandemic. Aware that religious care can be particularly important for many in difficult times, the ombudsman's office has sought to examine, at its own initiative, the situation with religious communities, the police, the army, penitentiary institutions and social welfare institutions.

Of the 56 registered religious communities, 18 responded to the office's questionnaire, most of them thanking the ombudsman for his concern. The ombudsman in turn informed the responsible authorities of the findings, the press release by the Ombudsman's Office added.",religion and belief
Karmina Šilec's new opera to premiere in US,"An opera by Slovenian composer Karmina Šilec inspired by sworn virgins from the Balkans will premiere in the US this week. BABA: The Life and Death of Stana will be performed at Z Space in San Francisco from Thursday to Sunday by Kitka, a women's vocal ensemble from California which draws on traditional folk vocal techniques.","The opera is inspired by real and imagined stories of Balkan sworn virgins - women who live as men after taking vows of chastity and celibacy.

This dying tradition is rooted in a centuries-old social code of law present in remote rural regions of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia.

These women assume male gender due to a loss of male relatives in blood feuds or out of desire to escape an oppressive arranged marriage in a patriarchal society.

Drawing on Balkan epic storytelling traditions, BABA explores gender, custom and interpretation of the phenomenon of sworn virgins through a liberal Western gaze.

""We try to address the problematic representations of the phenomenon of sworn virgins and deny the power of generalised images in forming an idea about them,"" Šilec said as she announced the project.

She feels the dominant ""Western narrative"" about the sworn virgins is problematic because of the different power ""Balkan subjects"" and the Western observer have.

The West has an apparent authority to assess Balkan subjects that stems from education and the imbalance of power as a result of politics and economy, she said.

""BABA explores this epistemic superiority of the Western observer over the Balkan 'uniquely violent and honour-obsessed' culture, often sensationalised in the media, anthropological sources, travelogues and popular culture, and offers a critique of the ways in which the Balkans are portrayed, which often seem to be just another example of internalised colonialism,"" said Šilec.

She developed the multi-genre project BABA over a number of years including fellowships and residencies at Harvard Radcliffe Institute, the Stellenbosch Institute in South Africa and The Ground Floor at Berkeley Repertory Theater.

Šilec is an award-winning composer, director, conductor, and artistic director of Carmina Slovenica, a production house from Maribor. She is best known in the US for Toxic Psalms, a production that premiered at the Prototype Festival in Brooklyn, New York, in 2015.",religion and belief
Pope requests new investigation of Slovenian priest Rupnik,"Pope Francis has lifted the statute of limitations in the case of Marko Rupnik, a Slovenian priest who was expelled from the Jesuit order due to sex abuse, to allow a canonical procedure to take place regarding allegations against him, Catholic media reported on Friday.","The pope asked the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to review the case. The Holy See issued a statement saying that in September the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors ""brought to the Pope's attention that there were serious problems in the handling of the Marko Rupnik case and lack of outreach to victims.""

This is why he asked the dicastery to review the case, and decided to lift the statute of limitations to allow a process to take place.

""The pope is firmly convinced that, if there is one thing the Church must learn from the Synod, it is to listen attentively and compassionately to those who are suffering, especially those who feel marginalised from the Church,"" the statement said.

The news comes just days after it was revealed that Rupnik had been incardinated by the Koper Diocese in Slovenia. Incardination is a term in the Catholic Church for a clergyman being under a bishop or other ecclesiastical superior.

Rupnik asked for incardination a month before he was excardinated by the Jesuit order and well after abuse allegations were made against him by several women, who at the time of the abuse were members of the Ljubljana-based Loyola community. Rupnik served as the community's spiritual leader in the 1990s.

The Koper Diocese has taken flack for that, and Rupnik's former superior, Johan Verschueren, told the news agency AP that he had written ""an exhaustive"" letter to Koper Bishop Jurij Bizjak about the many allegations that led to his excommunication.

Bizjak defended his contentious decision to welcome Rupnik into his diocese by saying that he had not received any documentation showing Rupnik had been found guilty of the alleged abuses.",religion and belief
Govt cuts coverage of social security contributions for religious workers,The government has adopted changes to the Freedom of Religion Act setting the state's co-funding of social security contributions for religious workers at 60%. This is lower than the 100% coverage they currently enjoy under a government decree.,"Under the Freedom of Religion Act before 2012, the state paid 60% of the religious workers' social security contributions that they pay to the state, the government said after its session on Thursday.

In 2012, the National Assembly passed a bill to balance public finances amid the financial crisis, lowering the state's co-funding to 48%.

In May 2022, the previous government adopted a decree raising the share to 100%, but only for a church or religious community that has the status of an organisation that benefits society.

The other religious groups were still entitled to only 60% coverage, which the new government considers discriminatory.

Palm Sunday celebrated in Slovenia,"Festive activities will be held at churches across Slovenia as Christians celebrate Palm Sunday, commemorating Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem a week ahead of Easter.","It is a tradition for Slovenian believers to bring olive branches or other greenery and elaborately crafted colourful bunches of greens known as ""butare"" to churches, which are then blessed by the priests before being taken back home.

Believers carrying these substitute palms often gather for processions outside of churches or passing through villages before attending holy mass.

The palm branches that the crowd scattered in front of Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem symbolise triumph. The greenery also stands for fertility and life, while the olive branch is a symbol of peace and conciliation.

In Slovenia, the ""butare"" are often made of dyed shavings of wood, bound around branches of various trees or shrubs. They sometimes have fruit such as oranges bound into them as well.",religion and belief
First woman appointed secretary general of Bishops' Conference,"The Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK) has recently appointed sister Marija Šimenc the new secretary general, making her the first woman ever to hold the post.

""In a wide range of ministries she has performed and continues to perform today, she has been mentally engaged with the processes of interrelationships and behaviours in communities and society in general,"" the SŠK said.

According to the tabloid Slovenske Novice, Novo Mesto bishop and SŠK head Andrej Saje said Šimenc was appointed secretary general because she had extensive managerial experience within her religious institute and the Church, and also possessed all other required qualities.

He noted she is fluent in Italian, which is very important for cooperation within the Church internationally and at the level of European bishops' conferences. In general, inclusion of the laity, including nuns in the Bishops' Conference, is ""in the spirit of the synodal process that is taking place all over the world"", he added.

The new SŠK secretary general told Slovenske Novice that ""Pope Francis has for many years encouraged the inclusion of women in various ministries in the Church, which do not necessarily have to be performed by a priest, as women can contribute their expertise and experience.

Protestant to represent religious communities on new RTV council,"President Nataša Pirc Musar has nominated Klaudija Sedar, a 42-year-old representative of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, as a member of the new governing council at RTV Slovenija to represent the religious communities in the country.","Pirc Musar selected the representative of religious communities in line with the changes to the public broadcaster act endorsed in a November 2022 referendum and based on a public call to registered religious communities to propose their candidates.

The new council will have 17 members, down 12 from the previous programme council, and its appointment procedure has also been changed to exclude parliament from it.

Eleven members will represent various publics, including the registered religious communities, while RTV staff will select their six members among themselves.

Sedar holds a PhD in intercultural studies and currently heads Zavod Primoža Trubarja, a research and cultural institution set up by the Evangelical Church, Pirc Musar's office said.

Sedar has also published several books and edited a number of Evangelical publications, including the monthly Evangeličanski List.

Balkan religious leaders urge joint efforts to overcome differences,"A two-day meeting of religious leaders from the Balkans started in Koper on Saturday. Addressing the meeting, which is hosted by the Slovenian Catholic Church, President Nataša Pirc Musar called on the religious leaders to help overcome differences in the region. The participants expressed support for the region's EU prospects.","The meeting is hosted by the Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK) in cooperation with the Diocese of Koper.

Launching the Forum for Dialogue and Peace in the Balkans, the main segment of the meeting, SŠK president Andrej Saje said that in addition to the international community the commitment to peace in modern society involved other social entities too, in particular the Christian churches and other religions, as well as individuals.

""We are co-responsible for life on this planet, through small and everyday actions we are fellow workers in building peace,"" he said.

The commitment to peace is possible only through sincere dialogue and the ability to listen, Saje said, urging the forum to be an example of dialogue, listening, accepting differences and cooperation, ""so that we reduce divisions and conflicts and contribute to efforts to build peace and a better world"".

Also addressing the forum, President Pirc Musar said that due to acute political instability in the Western Balkans, crimes that took place in the region, and the rollback of democracy ""we witness everywhere today"", the timing of the meeting could not be more appropriate. The question of how to move forward is more pressing than ever, she added.

She stressed the need to continue with EU accession efforts in the region. ""I would like to see leaders in the region realise that they will be stronger if they are part of European integration, and that sometimes things have to be given up for this.

""Every candidate country, including Slovenia, has been tested in this way. The fact that we had to make certain compromises in moving towards the EU has paid off in many ways. In every respect, Slovenia is infinitely richer today than when it was not a member state,"" she said.

Aware that the region still faces many challenges, the president pointed to divisions and exclusion, including on the grounds of religion. She therefore called on the religious leaders to help overcome divisions in the region.

""If anyone, it is you, who can take a big, even decisive step towards cooperation, mutual understanding, the elimination of divisions and the acceptance of difference [...] You too are called to help the entire region move towards a path of forgiveness, acceptance of diversity, and an inclusive future.""

The forum is also attended by Prime Minister Robert Golob and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, who is taking part in the event as a delegate of Pope Francis.

The Balkan region was once called a powder keg, Parolin said, but at the same time there have been ""many remarkable examples of harmonious coexistence between members of different nationalities, cultures and faiths in the region"".

Nevertheless, challenges remain, including constant efforts to invest in a culture of encounter ""to avoid a culture of confrontation"", he said, highlighting dialogue as an important aspect ""that is essential in the current era of globalisation"".

Parolin also stressed the importance of interfaith dialogue, which Pope Francis also believes is ""an essential prerequisite for peace"". Interfaith dialogue is the duty of all believers and religious leaders, he added.

The Vatican's secretary of state sees efforts to move towards EU membership as one of the solutions to maintain peace in the region, and such efforts are supported by the Holy See.

The meeting in the coastal town of Koper is one of the most important religious events in Slovenia and the wider region this year.

It is attended by the leaders of the Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Muslim and Jewish communities from the region. In their addresses, they all stressed the need and their own responsibility for dialogue and constant active efforts to overcome differences. The challenges are many, but they are not insurmountable, they said.

At the end of the three-hours forum, the participants adopted a special resolution noting that peace is their common goal and calling on all individuals, especially those in positions of leadership, to promote and work for it.

They stress that extremism, terrorism and all other forms of violence and war have nothing to do with genuine religion, and must be rejected both in society as well as at the level of religious communities.

They note the need for regular meetings and efforts to seek joint solutions between the various religious communities in the Balkan region, where, due to their historical and current influence, the Catholic and Orthodox churches and the Islamic community have a particular responsibility.

What will follow in the afternoon is a Youth for Peace cultural meeting, and in the evening a gala organ concert will be held at the Koper cathedral.

Cardinal Parolin, who is scheduled to meet Pirc Musar and Golob this afternoon, will say mass in the cathedral tomorrow.",religion and belief
Church to host religious dignitaries from Balkans in June,The Catholic Church in Slovenia will organise a meeting of religious dignitaries from 15 countries in the Balkans to foster dialogue and peace. The Forum for Dialogue and Peace in the Balkans will be held in the port city of Koper on 17 and 18 June in a bid to prevent the erosion of peace in the region in interreligious dialogue.,"Bishop of Murska Sobota Peter Štumpf said at Tuesday's news conference in Ljubljana that the first duty of believers of all faiths was to take care of peace.

Štumpf, who will chair the forum's board, pointed to the role of dialogue to enhance religious freedom while also boosting the sustainable care for natural resources and economic development where ""the well-being of people and communities must prevail over endless growth and profit"".

According to the bishop, such efforts help promote peace and prevent disputes that could turn into an armed conflict like the one in Ukraine.

Bishop of Koper Jurij Bizjak outlined the reasons for choosing Koper - a port city on the border with Italy - as the host city.

Koper has been ""a window to the world"" throughout history, even during the Cold War, when the state border between the former Yugoslavia and Italy was the most open border between Eastern and Western Europe, he said.

Slovenia is moreover seen as knowing very well the situation in the Balkans, and the Koper Diocese is at the meeting point of three large families of European nations - Slavic, Romance and Germanic nations, said Bizjak.

Štumpf said that Apostolic Nuncio to Slovenia Jean-Marie Speich encouraged them to organise the forum, which enjoyed the support of the Holy See and Pope Francis.

Asked whether the pope could attend it, Božo Rustja, the forum's PR officer, said his visit ""could not be ruled out"" as he could decide to attend just before the event.

Ethnologist Silvester Gaberšček said invitations had been sent to representatives of religious communities in 15 countries, ""from Istanbul to Mt Triglav"" and to the ambassadors of these countries, while a delegation of the Holy See will also take part. Štumpf added the most senior Slovenian politicians had also been invited.",religion and belief
First woman appointed secretary general of Bishops' Conference (adds),"The Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK) has recently appointed sister Marija Šimenc the new secretary general, making her the first woman ever to hold the post. Šimenc, who will succeed Tadej Strehovec, will start her five-year term on 17 April to become the highest-raking woman in the Slovenian Roman Catholic Church.","Šimenc is a nun of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians or Salesian Daughters of Don Bosco. ""In a wide range of ministries she has performed and continues to perform today, she has been mentally engaged with the processes of interrelationships and behaviours in communities and society in general,"" the SŠK said.

According to the tabloid Slovenske Novice, Novo Mesto bishop and SŠK head Andrej Saje said Šimenc was appointed secretary general because she had extensive leadership experience within her religious institute and the Church, and also possessed all other required qualities.

He noted she is fluent in Italian, which is very important for cooperation within the Church internationally and at the level of European bishops' conferences. In general, inclusion of the laity, including nuns in the Bishops' Conference, is ""in the spirit of the synodal process that is taking place all over the world"", he added.

The new SŠK secretary general told Slovenske Novice that ""Pope Francis has for many years encouraged the inclusion of women in various ministries in the Church, which do not necessarily have to be performed by a priest, as women can contribute their expertise and experience. I think that with this appointment, the bishops have listened to the pope and have put into practice what he recommends.""

The SŠK said in a press release today that women in the Catholic Church in Slovenia frequently hold senior and managerial posts in the pastoral ministry, Catholic educational institutions and lay associations. They are most often members or leaders of parish or diocesan prayer groups, parish councils, catechists and assistants in religious education, and lecturers in educational institutions.

Most of the Slovenian Catholic cultural and educational institutions are also headed by nuns or laywomen, including the Archiepiscopal Archives of Ljubljana, the Conference of Religious Institutes of Slovenia, the Slovenian Catechetical Office, the Catechetical-Pastoral School, the Alojzij Šuštar Primary School in Ljubljana, the Samaritan Karitas Institute, the Museum of Christianity in Slovenia in Stična and the Schellenburg Cultural Centre in Ljubljana.

Since the Second Vatican Council, the Church in Slovenia has increasingly included women in the educational, pastoral and leadership life of the Church, the SŠK said.

However, women cannot become priests in the Catholic Church, as is the case in the Evangelical Church, for example.",religion and belief
Pope Francis shocked by allegations against Rupnik,"Pope Francis has told the American news agency Associated Press (AP) that he was shocked by the sexual and psychological abuse allegations against Marko Rupnik, a Slovenian Jesuit priest and artist. This is his first response to the case that was brought to public attention last December.","""For me, it was a surprise, really. This, a person, an artist of this level - for me was a big surprise, and a wound,"" the pope told AP in a wide-ranging interview that was released on Wednesday.

He denied having a role in deciding the case of the famous artist, with whom he had reportedly been close.

AP noted that Rupnik's seemingly preferential treatment ""cast doubt on the Vatican's commitment to cracking down on abuse"".

Talking about other cases of sex abuse allegations against the clergy in the Catholic Church and its handling of these cases, Francis said he wanted more transparency but suggested ""it was an uphill battle in an institution that for centuries has handled predator priests behind closed doors.""

The Rupnik scandal broke in December after several Italian blogs and websites made public allegations by several women who claimed that the priest abused them sexually, spiritually and psychologically while they were members of the Jesuit-affiliated Loyola community he helped found in Slovenia in the 1990s, AP said. Rupnik was the nuns' spiritual leader at the time.

A former nun filed a complaint against him in 2021, but the relevant church authority decided not to prosecute him, citing the statute of limitations.

Several years ago, the Vatican excommunicated Rupnik for committing one of the most serious crimes in the church - using the confessional to absolve a woman with whom he had had sex. This measure was lifted within a month because Rupnik admitted the sin and repented for it.

Te following year ""the Vatican decided to not waive the statute of limitations when nine women filed complaints about his alleged abuse in Slovenia,"" AP added.

The pope told the news agency that in Rupnik's case his only involvement had been to intervene procedurally to keep the second set of accusations from the nine women with the same tribunal that had heard the first.

His only decision was to ""let it continue with the normal court, because, if not, procedural paths are divided and everything gets muddled up.""

AP pointed out that questions were raised why the Vatican did not waive the statute of limitation in this case.

Francis responded by saying that he had always waived the statute of limitations when it came to cases involving minors and ""vulnerable adults"", but tended to do otherwise in cases involving others.

In recent days, two more former nuns joined the allegations against Rupnik, telling the Italian newspaper Domani that he had groped and sexually assaulted them while they were part of the Ljubljana-based Loyola community. They had also been victims of psychological violence.

One of them, who is now 56 years old, told the paper that in 1990 Rupnik had manipulated her into joining the community. He tried to make excuses for his misdeeds by citing spirituality, she added, and when she stood up to him, psychological violence ensued.

The other woman said she had met Rupnik when she was a minor, at the age of 16. He kissed her at the time and after she joined the community, multiple sexual assaults against her followed.",religion and belief
Alleged abuser Rupnik incardinated by Koper Diocese,"Artist and priest Ivan Rupnik, who was expelled by the Jesuit order in June over allegations of sexual abuse of nuns, has been incardinated by the Koper Diocese, the Catholic web portal Silere Non Possum reported on Wednesday, with the diocese confirming this for the Slovenian Catholic weekly Družina.","Rupnik asked for incardination a month before he was excardinated by the Jesuit order and well after abuse allegations were made against him by several women, who at the time of the abuse were members of the Ljubljana-based Loyola community. Rupnik served as the community's spiritual leader in the 1990s.

Bishop Jurij Bizjak decided to grant Rupnik's request a week after receiving it and after having consulted the Apostolic Nuncio in Slovenia, Jean-Maria Speich, as well as Vicar of the Diocese of Rome Angelo De Donatis and Giacomo Incitti, a canon law professor at the Pontifical Urban University and an expert consultor at the Church's supreme canonical court.

Since his incardination, Rupnik is free to practice as a priest, said Silere Non Possum, adding that he above all wanted to continue leading spiritual training and make mosaics.

Allegations against Rupnik came to light in December, when he was accused of physically and mentally abusing Loyola sisters in 1992 and 1993.

By that time, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith had already closed an investigation into the case, finding the allegations to be too old and deciding not to prosecute Rupnik.

The Jesuit order, of which he was a prominent member, first took precautionary measures, prohibiting him from taking confession, lead spiritual training and appear publicly without permission. He violated most of the bans and was expelled from the order.

Meanwhile, Družina reported that other former Slovenian Jesuits who were members of Aletti Centre in Rome had been incardinated into the Celje Diocese, while Silere Non Possum reported that one had asked to be incardinated by the Ascoli Piceno diocese in Italy.

Last month, the Diocese of Rome presented its own investigation that focused on the Aletti Centre, finding healthy communal life without any ""special critical factors"". What is more, it raised doubts about the procedures connected to allegations against Rupnik.

The Aletti Centre was founded in 1992 by Rupnik and has also been named by the alleged victims as a location where the abuse took place.",religion and belief
Christians celebrating Easter,"Christians are celebrating Easter, the most important holiday on their calendar, which marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter Sunday Masses will be held in the morning as the culmination of Holy Week. Slovenian bishops will give Masses in cathedrals and Pope Francis is to hold the Urbi et Orbi blessing in the Vatican.","Easter Vigils and resurrection processions will be held in the morning, accompanied by the singing of hallelujahs, announcers of Jesus Christ's resurrection. Christians believe that by rising from the dead he beat death and gave the people the chance for an afterlife.

Roman Catholic biships in Slovenia said in their Easter message that this is ""the humanity's most beautiful and greatest holiday, a holiday celebrating life's victory over death"", and wished everyone a happy holiday, especially the elderly who are sick and lonely, the refugees and the weak.

Novo Mesto Bishop Andrej Saje, head of the Slovenian Bishops' Conference, will celebrate the Easter Mass and procession at 6:30am in the town's cathedral together with Apostolic Nuncio to Slovenia Jean-Marie Speich.

In Ljubljana, the mass of the Ressurection of the Lord will be given by the Archbishop Stanislav Zore at 8:30am and in Maribor by Archbishop Alojzij Cvikl at 7am.",religion and belief
Slovenia calls for de-escalation in Jerusalem,"Concerned about recent violent incidents in Jerusalem, Slovenia has called for de-escalation of the situation there. ""In sacred places, the status quo must be respected. We also condemn missile attacks on Israel and call for de-escalation to prevent further violence during the holidays,"" the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.","During Wednesday night, Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem during Ramadan evening prayers, just hours after they first raided the compound and arrested hundreds of Palestinians.

The incidents, which came as Muslims mark the holy month of Ramadan and Jews begin Passover, made tensions in Jerusalem flare up, and on Thursday the compound was again the site of clashes between the Israeli forces and groups of young Palestinians.

Palestinian fighters in Gaza responded to the raids with missile attacks, which were then in turn followed by strikes on the Gaza Strip and Lebanon targeting Hamas and Hezbollah groups.

Al-Aqsa Mosque is one of Islam's holiest sites, but the hilltop compound on which it sits is a sacred site for both Muslims and Jews - the latter consider it their most holy site.

The sensitive area has long been a flashpoint for violence in Jerusalem. Under the ""status quo"" arrangement governing the area, non-Muslims can visit but only Muslims are allowed to worship in the mosque compound.",religion and belief
