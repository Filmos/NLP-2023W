Dnevnik: Govt forced to act fast on top-up insurance,"Dnevnik argues in Thursday's commentary that the reason the government acted quickly to abolish top-up insurance is that not acting would have been too costly politically and would have given the opposition, which was getting ready to table its own legislation, a head start in an area that is crucial to the government's survival.","""It was not just prestige and political stability that necessitated the reaction, it was because the announced hike in the top-up health insurance premiums caught the government by surprise,"" the paper says, adding that the legislation is ""an attempt to take the initiative in the legislative and political context.""

Describing the government bill as a major development in an area where many centre-left governments and coalitions have failed while ""politicians on the opposite political pole vacationed on yachts and golf courses on exotic islands with major hospital suppliers and lobbyists,"" the commentator says this is but an introduction to ""a hot summer, when we can expect that all means will be activated to oppose change"".

A nice example of such stonewalling is public broadcaster RTV Slovenija, where nothing has happened after the referendum. Indeed, the situation has even worsened. ""The coalition cannot afford a similar fiasco in healthcare ... A year into its term, we may have finally heard a clear political message from the coalition that it has started to work for the people,"" concludes the commentary Working in the Interest of the People.",politics,"['politics', 'economy, business and finance']"

Corruption watchdog says it cannot be moral arbiter,"The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (KPK), which has found itself under fire for finding no conflict of interest in the case of Antonija Poplas Susič, director of the Ljubljana Community Health Centre, said on Friday its work was restricted by law. ""We cannot be moral arbiters,"" the watchdog said.","""Because of vaious inaccurate assessments of our work as an independent state institution in the media"", the KPK stressed it is bound by the integrity and prevention of corruption act and ""cannot rule on the areas we have no powers on"".

""This means that we cannot be moral arbiters and decide whether the regulations dealing with employment and other relations are appropriate."" The KPK said it had called for changes to several laws on many occasions.

This comes after the watchdog found no conflict of interest in the case of Poplas Susič, who is not only the manager at Ljubljana's public health centre but also the only founder and director of private health centre Multimedicus.

The KPK said that ""based only on simultaneous execution of two offices or jobs, we cannot yet speak of a conflict of interest"".

It explained that an official such as director must exclude themselves from decisions on cooperation of their public institution with businesses with which the person has personal, business or political ties. Should they not, their actions would create an impression of conflict of interest, from where there is a short way to corruption.

If the law allows for practices that a certain part of society finds unacceptable such as a person managing a public institute also running a private clinic, a systemic solution must be found, the KPK said.

The same goes for the powers of the KPK, which should be addressed with changes to the integrity and prevention of corruption act, it said.

The procedure on Poplas Susič at the KPK has been suspended, but the KPK forwarded the complaint on the basis of which it had assessed her case to the community health centre's governing council, as the commission found ""the case contains at least signs of breaches of rules or other relevant information within the power of other bodies"".","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice', 'health']"
First public prayers draw split opinions,"The Catholic Youth organisation held the first public prayer of the rosary in Ljubljana's Congress Square on Friday morning. Around a hundred people attended the event, including the youth wing of the largest opposition party. Some criticised the event as sexist since men in particular had been invited, newspaper Delo reports.","A public prayer is more powerful than a private one, the organiser wrote in the invitation, addressing it in particular to ""young men and boys, who are the first to be called to be leaders and an example in serving as a witness to faith"".

That caused an uproar among a part of the public who believe that such actions deny women equality and social roles that men automatically have in society.

The founder of the Catholic Youth, the Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK), supports the organisation's activities, including the public square prayer, arguing that it is a legitimate and common expression of faith.

Dismissing accusations about undermining gender equality, the SŠK said that the Church organised numerous events every day dedicated to different social groups. The organiser meanwhile stressed the importance of men in efforts to strengthen people's faith.

The participants prayed for the homeland, for the faith of Slovenian youth, for a successful start of the academic year and for world peace, said the organiser, which modelled the event on public prayers abroad, for example in Poland and Croatia, and intends to continue holding them.

Aleš Črnič, a religious studies expert from the Ljubljana Faculty of Social Sciences, told Delo that the event was part of the Church's global movement to retraditionalize social life and impose conservative views and norms on the rest of society.

He sees the Congress Square prayer more as a ""political manifestation"" than a religious ritual, noting that political activity is not protected by the principle of religious freedom.

According to Delo, the youth wing of the Democrats (SDS) had announced it would take part in the event, while the Christian conservative party New Slovenia (NSi) had not.

Meanwhile, constitutional law expert Samo Bardutzky from the Ljubljana Faculty of Law notes that the Constitution safeguards not only private expressions of faith but also public ones, including those that may border on political expressions.",religion and belief,['religion and belief']
Delo comments on Slovenia's limited power to help W Balkans,"While people in Bosnia-Herzegovina appreciate Slovenia's efforts to help them be integrated in the EU and NATO, doubt is being expressed from all sides in the country about the reach and power of diplomacy of small friends such as Slovenia, Delo says in the front-page commentary on Saturday.","Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said that the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and all Western Balkan countries is indisputably in the EU and NATO, as she addressed an event in Sarajevo during her recent visit to the country.

Slovenia's inclination to the Western Balkans and the sincere efforts of Slovenian diplomacy to secure Bosnia-Herzegovina the EU candidate status are recognised by members of all three constituent nations in the country, the newspaper notes.

""At the same time ... doubt is being expressed from all sides in the country about the reach and power diplomacy of small friends like Slovenia. They appreciate the sincerity of small friends, but they are aware of the true power of large and loud opponents of the EU enlargement to the south-east, such as France and the Netherlands.""

Delo adds that in addition to the major opponents of enlargement among the member states, all those involved in the process are also very well aware of the opposition to the enlargement of NATO by Russia, which is very influential in the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The newspaper notes that many towns in Republika Srpska are being ruled by descendants of the Chetniks who openly celebrate Vladimir Putin and people sentenced for war crimes in The Hague.

"Kyiv organiser says Laibach ""misunderstands reasons for our war""","The organiser of the cancelled Kyiv concert by Laibach rejected on Tuesday the Slovenian band's view it had been expected to categorically denounce all Russian art. Explaining this had not been demanded explicitly, Laibach in turn said its expressed appreciation of some Russian artists had been noted among the reasons for the cancellation.","Elaborating on the reasons for the cancellation of the concert planned for 31 March and commenting on Laibach's response, the Bel Etage Music Hall from Kyiv wrote that ""the concert was cancelled due to the protest of Ukrainians against the arrival of Laibach, which was caused by the band's misunderstanding of the reasons for our war"".

The organiser dismissed the view that it demanded of Laibach to dismiss all Russian art as worthless as a lie, saying the kept correspondence proved that.

""After their appeal to the Ukrainians, in which a whole paragraph is devoted to Russian art, no one demanded anything from them,"" the organiser says.

""The fact that everything Russian is toxic for us was mentioned in the letter cancelling the concert. That is, no one demanded anything,"" the organiser explained, adding the audience considered Laibach's stance on the war - the band framed it as a geopolitical conflict between Russia and the US on Ukrainian territory - as pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian.

Meanwhile, Laibach explained for the STA today that the demand for the band to explicitly state that all Russians are bad and that all Russian art is worthless had not been made explicitly by the organiser.

However, Laibach added that its expressed appreciation of some Russian artists had been highlighted by the organiser as one of the reasons for the cancellation.

""Immediately after the concert was officially announced...there was an uproar on social media about some of our statements and interpretations about the possible causes of the Ukraine-Russia war, which are not fully in line with the Ukrainian view of things, so the promoter asked for our official statement that we unreservedly support Ukraine in this war,"" the world-renowned band wrote.

""We issued this statement, while adding that this does not mean that we hate everything Russian, and that we still appreciate some Russian artists,"" Laibach wrote.

""Not to be mistaken - we love Russian literature, music and art. We love Dostoyevsky, Bulgakov, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Mayakovsky, Tatlin, Rodchenko and El Lissitzky - to name but a few - and we always will. But in this senseless war between Russia and Ukraine, we are wholeheartedly on the side of Ukraine and its people...,"" reads part of Laibach's statement posted two days before Sunday's cancellation.

The band added today that the organiser had said the concert needed to be cancelled because the statement had not been formulated in the right way and caused additional uproar. The organiser said the statement that the band supported Ukraine in the war but did not reject Russian art had not been accepted well, Laibach said.

The band quotes the organiser as saying that for the Ukrainians everything Russian is toxic now, Russian literature is evil, the Russian language is evil, everything Russian only causes hatred. While the band did not seem to be aware of this, its statements have caused a lot of indignation, the organiser reportedly added.

""And that was also one of the reasons why the concert was cancelled,"" Laibach said.","arts, culture and entertainment","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'arts, culture and entertainment']"

Interior Minister Poklukar welcomes migration deal with Tunisia,"Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar noted the importance of cooperation with third countries in migration as he attended an informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. In this light, he welcomed the agreement with Tunisia and said he expected the European Commission to continue such cooperation with other countries.","Speaking to the press after the first day of the two-day session in Spain's Logrono, Poklukar said that cooperation with third countries could help prevent crisis situations.

""The approach applied in cooperation with Tunisia goes in the right direction, as agreements with third countries should be more comprehensive and cover broader aspects than exclusively migration. We thus expect the European Commission to continue such work with other countries, such as Morocco and Egypt,"" he said.

As part of the agreement, the EU will financially compensate Tunisia with more than EUR 100 million this year for its contribution in preventing migrants and refugees from going to Europe.

The agreement has been criticised by members of Human Rights Watch, who on Wednesday called on the EU to suspend the agreement in light of serious abuses of migrants by the Tunisian security authorities.

The session of the EU ministers also discussed access to data for combatting crime in the digital age, combatting organised crime, cooperation with Latin America and the situation in Ukraine in relation to internal security.

As part of the discussion on illicit drug trade, Minister Poklukar noted that in combatting organised crime, it was necessary to improve cooperation with regions that had a significant influence on this trade or that were the countries of origin.

He singled out the Western Balkans as a priority transit region that affects the situation in Slovenia.

The ministers were united in the opinion that, in order to effectively investigate this kind of crime, it is necessary to follow the principle of the flow of money and to invest all available resources and knowledge, the Interior Ministry said.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Valentina Prevolnik Rupel appointed new health minister (adds),"Economist Valentina Prevolnik Rupel, a state secretary at the Health Ministry, was appointed health minister in a 48:17 vote on Friday. She is replacing Danijel Bešič Loredan, whom PM Robert Golob asked to resign in early July over different views on how to reform the country's public healthcare. Prevolnik Rupel has already been sworn in.","Prevolnik Rupel, born in 1971, stressed better access to healthcare, high-quality services, a reform of the basket of services, and patients who don't have a named GP as her priorities during her hearing on the parliamentary Health Committee, which endorsed her candidacy on Tuesday.

She holds a PhD in economics, with her 2009 thesis focussing on healthcare financing and quality, while she has served as Health Ministry state secretary for the past three months, working closely with Golob, who stepped in as health minister. She has also been on the health council, an advisory body drafting reform proposals.

Before becoming state secretary, she was a researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Ljubljana focussing on healthcare and long-term care, while she had previously also served as adviser to the health minister and to the director general of the country's public health fund ZZZS.

Presenting his pick to MPs, Golob said today that Prevolnik Rupel had the best insight into the challenges of healthcare, which made her the best choice for the job.

She also enjoys the support of all healthcare stakeholders, which is a clear sign that she is the one who can give the most efficient solutions to the challenges ahead.

Golob is confident that she will manage to cut wait times and enable access to a GP to more patients, while her main task will be to introduce quality of health services into the way they are financed.

The MPs of all three coalition parties hailed Prevolnik Rupel's competences, but stressed that she must immediately continue the ministry's work and be efficient.

Bojana Muršič of the Social Democrats (SD) said that Prevolnik Rupel's priorities were consistent with the goals of the coalition agreement.

Since people want an accessible, high-quality and public healthcare system, while time is running out, ""the work must continue with a lot of efficiency"".

Muršič believes that Prevolnik Rupel not being a medical doctor is by no means an obstacle but an advantage as she knows the system well.

The Left expects the new minister to be foremost the bulwark of public healthcare and to be aware that the market logic must be driven out of Slovenia's healthcare.

As for Prevolnik Rupel's plans to overhaul the basket of services, MP Matej Tašner Vatovec said the Left understood it not as reducing them but as introducing more order.

The minister will also have to pun an end to a number of lobbies, including those of doctors, insurers and all the other private interests, he said.

Muršič and Tašner Vatovec urged changing the manner in which the public health fund ZZZS is funded as a prerequisite to achieve the set goals.

The SD welcomed Prevolnik Rupel's view to merge the current mandatory and voluntary health insurance contributions and suitably adjust the contribution rate to secure enough funds, while Vatovec said that new sources of funds should also be considered.

The two opposition parties, on the other hand, votd against the candidate. The Democrats (SDS) said that healthcare reform was not Prevolnik Rupel's goal anymore, while New Slovenia (NSi) said that health policy did not depend on the minister alone but on the entire coalition.

SDS MP Karmen Furman indicated that the government coalition had obviously dropped the health reform, as it had not implemented any of the announced legislative changes yet. ""There is clearly no more health reform in this coalition, so the main question here is whether the minister has a goal.""

Furman also complained Prevolnik Rupel outlined the situation in healthcare to the Health Committee but presented no solutions, including for psychotherapy.

Given her credentials, the SDS is surprised Prevolnik Rupel mentioned the basket of services as a priority while she was unable to say how she will define the basket.

NSi MP Iva Dimic said the new minister would have to act fast to tackle issues such as a shortage of staff, staff leaving abroad, staled investment, problems with the congenital heart disease department, management of medical organisations, dental care, orthodontics, digitalisation and mental health.

The NSi also expect her to tackle psychotherapy and waiting times, said Dimic, noting that despite a number of measures, waiting times have not been shortened.

In her statements before the appointment, Prevolnik Rupel indeed said that she will pursue a thought-out search for solutions and changes instead of a reform that would put healthcare upside down.

She announced several bill to address the priority areas, that is access to high-quality services. ""We'll take them on comprehensively, which means introducing gradual change step by step and in collaboration with all stakeholders, to comprehensively tackle healthcare.""

In her first statement after the appointment, Prevolnik Rupel said the work that had been set out at the ministry will be continued, and the ministry is already working on an emergency bill which will bring a number of measures.

She believes a solution will be found to the shortfall in ZZZS's revenue projected when voluntary health insurance is transformed into a mandatory contribution, which will be discussed with the Finance Ministry. Next year, the shortfall will be covered from the national budget.

As for her team, she said Marjan Pintar remains state secretary, to be joined by doctor Eva Vodnik, and Denis Kordež, deputy director at a community health centre.",health,"['politics', 'health']"
Dnevnik says govt must act to address shortage of teachers,"The newspaper Dnevnik discusses the shortage of teachers Slovenia is facing in its commentary on Friday, saying the government must start addressing the issue immediately.","The Ministry of Education has said that Slovenia was approaching a turning point that will lead to an increase in demand for teachers due to an increase in teachers retiring and an increase in the number of school-aged children.

To mitigate the negative effects this will have, the ministry plans to earmark more funds for education, scholarships for future teachers, financial aid, better work conditions and making the teaching profession more attractive in general.

Under the headline In Search of New Teachers, the paper says that there is no time to waste and that a comprehensive strategy is needed to make this change.

Finance suggests Golob's dislike for NEK 2 might not be bad for project,"Prime Minister Robert Golob's rumoured lack of enthusiasm for the planned second nuclear reactor might not necessarily be a bad thing for the project's outcome, says the newspaper Finance on Tuesday as it notes the prime minister's declining approval ratings.","Government approval ratings are falling, while it is rumoured that the public's support for nuclear energy is rising. It would be no surprise if the latter turns out to be true against the backdrop of the energy crisis.

Experts say that Golob and the government are not very enthusiastic about building the second unit at the Krško Nuclear Power Plant (NEK 2).

Sooner or later Slovenia will hold a referendum on this topic, and ""if Golob truly does not like NEK 2, this may not be a bad thing for NEK 2"".

There are two reasons for this suggestion: First, the prime minister has been facing enquiries about the operations of GEN-I, the energy company he used to run.

Accusations of alleged shady dealings did not have a major impact on the last general election and this would likely stay the case in the future election, since ""elections are the choice between (opposition leader Janez) Janša and Non-Janša"".

But it is likely there will be different criteria in the NEK 2 referendum, so the pro campaign should be led by supporters with a spotless track record.

And secondly, voters are sceptical about major infrastructure projects due to scandals in the past, but this time around there might be less distrust due to the government's dislike.

""If voters are truly increasingly in favour of the nuclear option and if Golob is truly against it, then it is time to consider holding a voter-triggered referendum soon.

""Why now? Who says, for example, Slovenians will be more in favour of NEK 2 in 2026 than today? A potential nuclear victory would give the nuclear project a powerful boost. But what about potential defeat? While it would not be pleasant for the supporters of the second reactor, it would probably not be fatal,"" says the commentary Why It Is Not a Bad Thing at All for NEK 2 if Golob Does Not Like It.",environmental issue,"['economy, business and finance', 'politics', 'environmental issue']"
"State forestry company with record revenue, profit in 2022","Slovenski Državni Gozdovi (SiDG), the public company managing state-owned forests in Slovenia, generated a record EUR 90.7 million in revenue last year and a record net profit of EUR 16.9 million, which is 31% and 21% more than in 2021, respectively.","""Operating results show that we managed to make good use of the favourable conditions in the markets last year,"" the annual report of SiDG says, noting that the successful 2022 had additionally improved the financial stability of the company.

The largest share (85%) of sales, was again generated by means of long-term sales contracts, which maintain the stable supply of the domestic wood industry and help promote the forestry-wood chain.

Compared to 2021, SiDG allocated 45% less funds for investments last year, or EUR 3.6 million. The company increased investments in cultivation and conservation work, and in the promotion of the social and ecological functions of forests.

More funds than in 2021 were also allocated for sponsorships and donations intended for the promotion of forests, forestry and wood processing.

This year, the company expects EUR 10 million in net profit and over EUR 12 million in investments, with the expected lower profit being the consequence of the changed circumstances in the market.

""It seems that the period of high prices of timber witnessed in recent years is coming to an end,"" the company said.

It noted that the biggest challenge in the future would be salvaging the subsidiary Snežnik, a wood processing company which is recording declining numbers due to the obsolete technology.

SiDG said it would implement a comprehensive restructuring programme to help keep afloat the company with 70 years of tradition.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Delo critical of lack of strategic planning in agriculture,The newspaper Delo's front-page commentary on Friday notes that Slovenia's agricultural policy has been long implemented without any clear strategic planning. As a result the country is lagging behind in agricultural modernisation and climate change adaptation.,"Agriculture is in bad shape in Slovenia due to rising production costs and this year's extreme weather events, and encouraging words and ambitious announcements will not be enough to improve the situation and increase food self-sufficiency.

The situation is ""partly due to the fact that for several government terms agricultural policy has been implemented without any clear strategic planning on what we want to achieve and how"", says the commentary No Strategy on Key Strategic Issue.

Afraid of new peasants' revolts, policy makers cater mainly to the loudest, which does not necessarily mean an increase in food sovereignty.

The country's delay in agricultural modernisation and climate change adaptation is a result of this. The Agriculture Ministry started updating the strategy as late as last year after more than a decade of unsystematic measures.

""However, in the meantime the future has caught up with us, and it looks like we will have to take emergency measures that will cost us dearly even before the new strategy and action plan.""

Trade unions oppose freezing of social transfers,"Trade union associations voiced fierce opposition to government plans to reduce budget expenditure next year by freezing social transfers and not indexing income tax brackets to inflation, as they accused the government on Monday of putting the cost of post-flood reconstruction on the shoulders of individuals.","Combined with the solidarity contribution for post-flood reconstruction, the people will contribute almost EUR 250 million for post-flood reconstruction, Lidija Jerkič, the head of the ZSSS trade union association, told the press.

Businesses have reported EUR 500 million in flood damage, but the floods did not affect all companies. ""How much will business contribute,"" she said.

Jerkič said the proposed measures will hurt people's purchasing power at a time when inflation remains high, which will in turn have a negative impact on economic growth.

""The Labour Ministry is sending out the message that the active population is not taxed enough and that social transfers, including family benefits, are too generous,"" she said.

Branimir Štrukelj, the president of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, meanwhile questioned the government's commitment to social dialogue, which was supposed to set it apart from the previous government.

""In this case, dialogue has been reduced to the notification that the government proposes the suspension of indexation,"" he said.

While the minimum wage was not mentioned among the cost-saving measures, Jerkič fears that this is on the table as well. If the minimum wage is not indexed to inflation in January, the trade unions plan to ""deploy any measures necessary,"" including an all-out strike, she said.",labour,"['labour', 'disaster and accident']"
Upper chamber vetoes a series of legislative changes,"The National Council, the upper chamber of parliament, vetoed on Wednesday changes to the Animal Protection Act, changes to the Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry Act, and a bill granting amnesty for fines issued during the Covid-19 pandemic. All three are likely to be passed again by the lower chamber.","All three sets of legislative changes were passed last week, with the coalition arguing that the changes to the Animal Protection Act brought much-needed solutions to fight animal abuse, while the main grievance from the opposition referred to the introduction of special ""qualified reporting persons"" that can check on animal welfare on farms.

Councillor Anton Medved said today that the changes did not have the support of legal, veterinary and agricultural experts. The legal experts even warned they could be constitutionally objectionable.

According to coalition MPs, changes to the Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry Act aim to reduce the political influence in the operation of the Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS).

Under the changes members of the bodies of political parties at the national level, MEPs, officials in the European Commission and the European Council cannot be candidates for members of certain bodies of the KGZS in the next elections in 2024.

This provision also applies to the president of the republic, prime minister, ministers and state secretaries, MPs, professional mayors, directors general and secretaries general at ministries, directors of bodies at ministries and government services.

Also covered by the ban are directors general and directors of directorates general at the European Commission, directors of municipal administrations and municipal secretaries.

The opposition and the KGZS itself argued last week that the changes encroached on the chamber's autonomy and did not eliminate unconstitutionalities, while being impossible to implement.

Branko Tomažič, who chairs the National Council's commission for agriculture, said today the changes were constitutionally objectionable in the context of the right to participate in the management of public affairs, the principle of equality before the law and the principle of the rule of law. The changes also severely interfere with the KGZS's autonomy, he said.

The third peace of legislation, the bill to grant amnesty for fines people received for breach of Covid rules during the pandemic was conceived as a step to right wrongs, but the largest opposition party maintained as it was being passed that it would only lead to new injustices.

Councillor Miloš Pohole said today that the individuals to be reimbursed had violated the law that was in force during the pandemic, with the potential consequence of this being the loss of life and health of a large number of people. Appropriate legislative solutions could be found based on the existing legislation, he said.

He warned that the solutions adopted now constituted a violation of the rule of law and set a bad example for the future. The law will also place a burden on the Slovenian judiciary and taxpayers, with the total estimated financial impact of the law amounting to over EUR 5 million, Pohole stressed.

The veto of the upper chamber means the National Assembly will need to take another vote on each of the three bills and this time they will need the support of 46 MPs to be passed.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Koležnik's production among top 10 in German-language theatre,"Slovenian director Mateja Koležnik's take on Maxim Gorky's play Children of the Sun, staged at the German theatre Schauspielhaus Bochum, has made the list of ten remarkable productions from the last season in German-speaking theatre. The jury of critics applauded her work as highly topical.","The jury wrote that ""at first glance, Mateja Koležnik's production of Maxim Gorky's 'Kinder der Sonne (Children of the Sun)' appears to be from a different time"", as it brings to mind somewhat dated theatre traditions.

""And yet, there is nothing museum-like about Koležnik's approach. In fact, her work is highly topical."" The characters behave in such a way to convey expressions of toxic privilege or egocentrism in the play whose centrepiece is the decline of a self-absorbed bourgeoisie.

""In this way, Koležnik moves Gorky's characters closer to us and our crisis-ridden reality,"" the seven-member jury said in a post on the Berliner Festspiele website.

Along with the other nine productions, Children of the Sun will be staged at the annual Berlin theatre festival Theatertreffen in May.

The top 10 productions were selected from a total of 461 performances by 58 theatres from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and co-productions between German theatres and theatres and companies from other countries.

Koležnik is busy these days preparing for tomorrow's sold-out premiere of another production, a fusion of Sophocles's Antigone and Slavoj Žižek's The Three Lives of Antigone, at the Munich Residence Theatre.

Koležnik's production is at the same time a political thriller and a family epic, said the theatre.

""I know that in theatre you have to distinguish between right and wrong, decide which character to side with. In Antigone, the personal right which concerns one's own family, one's own religion, is set against the state and its decisions.

President calls for cleaner environment and water in Slovenia (adds),"After a report of the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment for Slovenia was presented on Thursday, President Nataša Pirc Musar said it should serve as incentive for a faster green transition and preservation of biodiversity. She called on the government and relevant institutions to take measures to eliminate deficiencies.","As the special rapporteur David Boyd presented the report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, he called on Slovenia to take climate action based on the protection of human rights and care for the most vulnerable people.

He praised the diligence of households in waste sorting and the introduction of an environmental tax.

The report notes the case of Anhovo, where a higher rate of cancer is being detected for years due to poor air quality, the office of President Pirc Musar announced today.

It added that the president called for quick action also when it comes to access to safe drinking water for residents of some Roma settlements, such as Dobruška Vas. ""Clean drinking water must be provided without delay or excuses.""

Pirc Musar joined the call of the UN special rapporteur for the protection and improvement of air quality.

""The air is excessively polluted in several hot spots, which puts the health of adults and, even more so, the health of children, older people and the sick at risk,"" the president added.

Most of the warnings are nothing new, as they were also noted by Slovenian Human Rights Ombudsman Peter Svetina, who had contributed to the report.

""The rights to a healthy and clean environment and to clean drinking water are important human rights that belong to all of us,"" said the president.

While the rights to a healthy living environment and to drinking water are constitutional categories in Slovenia, the country is also among the main initiators at the international level of a new human right to a healthy and clean environment.

Pirc Musar welcomed the fact that this right was declared universal by the UN General Assembly in New York last summer, the president's office said.

In his Thursday's video address to the UN Human Rights Council, Ombudsman Svetina stressed that the constitutional right to clean water is being implemented too slowly.

He also agreed with UN special rapporteur Boyd that the public is too often excluded from decision-making in this field.

Svetina took this opportunity to urge the government to implement as soon as possible Boyd's recommendations regarding a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment and to present an implementation timeline, according to a posting on the ombudsman's website.",environmental issue,"['politics', 'environmental issue']"
Večer looks at internal fighting over Security Council bid,"Projects of national importance often become a hostage of internal political fighting, the newspaper Večer says in its commentary on Slovenia's UN Security Council bid as it takes a look at how former PM Janez Janša has tried to undermine Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon by revealing on whose initiative the country filed the bid.","The Robert Golob government ""adopted"" the candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council from the Janez Janša government and gave it a priority label.

Janša's government announced it in December 2021 rather than a few months earlier during the General Assembly session, where it could have already started lobbying.

Soon afterwards, then Foreign Minister Anže Logar was invited to the State Department, which prompted speculation that the bid was sponsored by the US.

And just recently, Janša ""flatly"" admitted on Twitter that Slovenia's bid was filed upon ""explicit request by American and European allies in the EU and NATO"".

Večer says this is no major revelation, because Slovenia is part of Western organisations. Yet Janša's ""thought-out missile"" targetted Fajon's statement that Slovenia is sovereign in its candidacy.

Under the headline Foreign Policy in a Meat Grinder, the paper says it has become custom for projects of national importance to sooner or later find themselves caught in the meat grinder of partisan interests.

This is not the first nor the last time that foreign policy has been instrumentalised for day-to-day politics and for positioning in the fight for credited for the candidacy's success, or blame for its failure.

At next week's elections in the General Assembly in New York, Slovenia will not enjoy the backing of the whole of politics, something which attentive diplomats will notice and report back to their countries.

Večer says that nothing can be taken for granted in the new geopolitical situation regardless of which country would be Slovenia's rival for the seat.

Thus Fajon's ""cautious optimism is the reality rather than a communication plan (in case of a failure)"", concludes Večer.",politics,"['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Govt withdraws bill on monthly bonus for judges and prosecutors,"The government has withdrawn from parliamentary procedure a bill which would give judges and prosecutors a monthly bonus of EUR 600 gross from 1 January this year until the public sector pay system has been reformed, according to information available on the website of the National Assembly. The reason for the decision is not yet known.","The government adopted the bill at a correspondence session on Monday, and asked the National Assembly to fast-track it through parliament.

However, the parliament's legal service had some serious reservations, including that the bill undermines the concept of pay from the public sector pay system act.

It also finds it problematic from the aspect of the division of power because judges and prosecutors would receive higher pay than top public servants in other branches of government, such as the president and prime minister, and even Constitutional Court judges.

Another problematic aspect is the duration of the measure - judges and prosecutors would receive the bonus until public sector pay reform is implemented but not beyond the end of 2023. This means that the bill in effect allows for their pay to be reduced if the reform is not implemented by then.

The opposition has also filed several amendments. New Slovenia (NSi) wanted to strike out all four provisions of the bill, and the Democrats (SDS) proposed that all public-office holders and public servants received the EUR 600 until systemic changes were introduced.

The bill was to be discussed by the parliamentary Justice Committee today before MPs were to vote on it at the plenary on Friday, but the committee's session was cancelled.

The reason for its withdrawal is hoped to be provided by Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan after today's government session.

The bonus was announced in early January when Prime Minister Robert Golob attended a session of the Slovenian Judges' Association, triggering a series of demands for higher pay.

The government, however, said that public sector pay increased by more than 25% between 2012 and 2020, while an average pay for judges increased by just over 5%.

According to the Justice Ministry, a total of 1,093 judges and prosecutors would receive the bonus, which would cost taxpayers an estimated EUR 9.1 million annually.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Delo feels history should no longer be divisive,"Delo argues that history should no longer be divisive as it comments on the upcoming Day of Uprising Against the Occupation on Wednesday, but it acknowledges this is unlikely to happen soon.","""Slovenians have different views of the past, sometimes they are completely opposite. There have been quite a few who have spoken on such occasions about daily (political) disputes, but too few have called for a bridging of the divide,"" the paper says.

The paper acknowledges that the political arch-rivals, Prime Minister Robert Golob and Democrat (SDS) leader Janez Janša, have both been forward-looking in their recent statements, which it says is ""important for the future of our children"".

But it goes on to note that the coming act against the glorification of Fascism, Nazism and collaboration, which the biggest coalition party is drawing up, is likely to achieve the opposite since the opposition is likely to oppose the omission of communism.

""With all the challenges that we face, history should no longer weigh down on us, let alone divide us. But this does not mean history should be forgotten,"" concludes the commentary Division and Way Towards the Future.",politics,['politics']
Golob: Extending border controls unjustified and ineffective (adds),"PM Robert Golob criticised Austria's control of the border with Slovenia ever since the 2015 migration crisis as unjustified and inefficient during his official visit to Vienna on Tuesday. Topping the agenda of his meeting with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer were also the Slovenian minority, energy, the war in Ukraine and EU enlargement.","Golob urged reintroducing Slovenian to kindergartens in the region of Carinthia, home to a large part of the Slovenian ethnic minority, to boost its use in the pre-school period.

""We're aware what richness minorities are. The most important initiative in the field of the Slovenian minority in Carinthia is to bring back the Slovenian language to kindergartens and strengthen its presence in the pre-school period,"" he said at a joint press conference alongside Nehammer.

Turning to border control on what are internal Schengen borders, Golob said ""data shows that such measures do not stop migration"", pointing to Denmark as an example of migration control that countries should follow.

Although Golob and Nehammer agreed cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin should be intensified, Nehammer said that for Austria protecting its border was of utmost importance.

""Here we must combine various measures,"" he said, citing statistics to support his statements - Austria had 109,000 applicants for asylum in 2022, of whom three quarters entered Austria unlawfully.

The Austrian chancellor said Slovenia was faced with a big migration pressure from Croatia. But asked why his country does not introduce control on the border with Italy, from where migration pressure is bigger, he said the migration route changed due to the strict control of the border with Slovenia.

On the other hand, ""Slovenia has no intention of introducing border control with Croatia, with which we are also setting an example to Austria that migration can be tackled in different ways"", said Golob.

He announced that Slovenia had given initiatives to expand mixed police patrols with neighbouring countries from border areas across the entire participating countries.

Nehammer meanwhile said that ""businesses need migration, but it has to be executed by the rules. If we manage to reduce the pressure on the border, then we can start talking about different measures on the border.""

As for the Western Balkans, the pair agreed Slovenia and Austria are natural allies in supporting Western Balkan countries, and Golob stressed the EU enlargement process is not working well.

He urged changes ""with a view to integrating the Western Balkan countries as soon as possible. This does not necessarily mean full membership overnight, but we must change the process of EU accession and integration.""

The need to be independent of Russian gas is a consequence of the war in Ukraine, said Golob as he discussed alternative sources of energy with Nehammer, not only in Algeria but also a gas terminal in Croatia.

He said that an initiative has already been given to organise a consortium of companies to build ""an alternative source"" on the island Krk, which ""starts in Omišalj, crosses Slovenia, Austria and brings gas all the way to Bavaria"".

"Inflation far from being tamed, says C-Bank governor (interview)","Even though inflation has eased off somewhat in recent months, Boštjan Vasle, the governor of the Slovenian Central Bank, says it is far from being curbed. As a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) he says they are determined to keep increasing interest rates.","The annual inflation rate in the euro area is estimated to have fallen to 8.5% in January, but this preliminary estimate does not yet include Germany.

""The core inflation rate, which does not include prices of food and energy, remains high, there are risks on the side of wage pressures,"" Vasle told the STA in an interview.

After the latest interest rise on Thursday, the ECB Governing Council announced that due to persisting inflation pressures, it intended to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points in March.

""In the coming months, the ECB will publish a new forecast of key macroeconomic indicators, which will form the basis for decisions on possible interest rate hikes. This does not mean that we are thinking of stopping or even reversing the process,"" says Vasle.

The process will continue ""at rates that will be appropriate in light of the latest forecasts,"" and the ECB Governing Council ""will probably stick to them for some time"".

It takes some time for the increase in interest rates to filter through to other segments of the financial market and into the decisions of businesses and the population.

""The lag is between a year and a year and a half, but at the same time we have a longer time horizon in mind,"" Vasle says. ""The idea of raising interest rates is to tighten financial conditions, to lower demand, to moderate economic growth and, as a consequence, to ease the pressure for higher prices.""

One reason that the interest hikes will continue is that ""we have only now entered the area where interest rates are no longer neutral"", that is such that neither obstruct nor accelerate economic activity.

""With core inflation persisting at such high levels, it is clear that interest rates will have to move into a restrictive zone,"" the governor says.

He notes that the economic slowdown in Slovenia and Europe is not as strong as expected, because a relatively mild winter in Europe is mitigating the energy crisis.

""Domestic consumption, in particular private, remains relatively robust, the labour market is still posting historically high results. On the other hand, the risks that were expected at the end of last year are lower or more evenly distributed,"" Vasle says.

""As far as inflation is concerned we are far from being able to say that we have tamed it or that the ECB Governing Council could start considering a different approach to monetary policy.

""Core inflation in Slovenia and the euro zone is far too high,"" says Vasle, pointing to the risk posed by wages. ""We cannot say for sure that companies have factored in wage rises in their prices so caution is required.""

He finds that wage growth is expected in such circumstances. ""At the European level and in Slovenia it is not excessive or such that we could talk of major additional pressure on inflation growth.""

However, if inflation persisted and if there were new pressures for wages rising above productivity or even inflation, ""we could start talking of excessive pressures"".

The central bank finds the situation in Slovenian banks good. ""Capital adequacy and liquidity remain high,"" Vasle says. Although the situation differs from one bank to another, the system is stable.

Bank deposits are at high levels, which is partly due to the Covid crisis as savings increased and there was less opportunity to spend, and some investment projects in the corporate sector were stalled.

""On the other hand, crediting is very strong. During the crisis, crediting of the corporate sector lagged somewhat behind compared to the EU, but is now catching up, at what is now among the fastest rates in the euro zone,"" says Vasle.

Household borrowing also remains high but the growth in lending to households has stabilised. ""The macroprudential measures that we have adopted in that respect have been successful, and in the meantime the external environment has changed as well,"" says Vasle. Growth in mortgage loans remains high though.

As the minimum wage in Slovenia raised this year, there have been warnings that the creditworthiness bar has become too high and many people can no longer take out a mortgage.

Although it is the central bank which regulates crediting, Vasle says that the limitations under which the borrower still needs a credit of at least 76% of the minimum gross wage left after settling their monthly instalment was not imposed by the central bank.

However, the central bank is in talks with the Finance Ministry to find solutions to the situation.

The central bank does not comment on bank takeovers, Vasle says when asked about the takeover on NKBM bank by the Hungarian bank OTP, which owns SKB bank in Slovenia. But, the central bank supports the system's consolidation in principle.

""Even European banks are rather fragmented at the global level and in Slovenia we have relatively many banks. From that aspect, consolidation in Slovenia is something that can bring additional solidity and stability, while making banks large enough to be able to introduce new products, and get better adapted to trends, in particular in digitalisation,"" says Vasle.

""The current market structure is not such the we could say there's excessive concentration. This is an organic process that has been evolving virtually for the whole post-independence period and has generated more benefits than potentially negative consequences.""

Vasle finds the reforms planned by the government of the taxes, wages, health, pensions and education systems are ambitious and he supports them in principle.

Debate on Slovenia needing to take structural reforms has been running for a long while. ""The situation at the global level in recent decades has changed and it calls for a response if we want to keep reducing the development lag to the more developed EU countries,"" Vasle points out.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'politics']"
Flame for Youth Olympic Festival arrives in Maribor,"With less than two months to go until the opening of the European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF) in Maribor, the Flame of Peace arrived in Slovenia's second city on Friday. Mayor Saša Arsenovič handed the flame, which in the coming weeks it will travel to a number of towns and schools across the country, to skiing star Ilka Štuhec.","The flame was lit in a ceremony in Rome on Wednesday, with the president of the European Olympic Committees, Spiros Capralos, handing symbolic olive branches to Arsenovič and Franjo Bobinac, the president of the Slovenian Olympic Committee.

Tomorrow, a group hike will take the flame to the Pohorje Hills above Maribor and then it will travel on to 27 towns and 18 elementary schools. The organisers hope it will spread the message of peace, hope and of the coming together of people of different nationalities, cultures, languages and traditions.

""This is the symbolic start of EYOF,"" Arsenovič said as the torch arrived in Maribor. ""The flame spreads the Olympic spirit and we hope that at a time when there's war in Europe, it will help make friendships and prevent military conflicts.""

The flame arrived in Maribor two weeks after the government provided an additional EUR 2.8 million to co-finance the upgrade of a track-and-field stadium, a key piece of infrastructure for the event.

Arsenovič noted that EYOF was the largest sporting event for those between the ages of 14 and 18, and that it had launched many successful careers. ""Maribor will be hosting 48 national teams ... and maybe some of the athletes will also be competing at the Paris Olympics next year.""

Štuhec was one of the successful athletes to compete at EYOF. ""I hope that the upcoming EYOF in Maribor will launch many successful careers,"" she said.

The event will take place between 23 and 29 July, featuring more than 3,600 athletes in eleven sports. For the first time, EYOF will feature competitions in skateboarding, mountain biking and 3x3 basketball.

The youth althletes will also compete in gymnastics, athletics, road cycling, handball, judo, swimming, tennis and volleyball.",sport,['sport']
Golob denies involvement in alleged Kosovo corruption scandal,"Prime Minister Robert Golob has denied any involvement in an alleged corruption scandal in Kosovo in which his former company, Gen-I, is allegedly implicated, telling parliament on Tuesday that the Democrats (SDS) had fabricated the story to deflect attention from their leader.","""It is fascinating to listen to your fabrications, which are completely made up,"" Golob told SDS lawmaker Žan Mahnič during questions time in parliament.

Mahnič quizzed Golob about what he described as foreign media reports about Slovenia as ""a country of cronyism and corruption believed to reach the very top of Slovenian politics"". ""You, prime minister, are being mentioned as the main protagonist in the spiral of crime,"" Mahnič added.

The MP was referring to a recent series of media reports in Serbia and Kosovo alleging than in 2019 and 2020 Gen-I had transferred EUR 600,000 to a private company, whereupon Martin Berishaj, Kosovo's ambassador in Zagreb, withdrew the money and delivered it to Golob.

These media, including tabloids with close ties to the Serbian government, claim that Golob has thus in effect financed the election campaign of Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti.

The reports mostly quote a fringe Slovenian website called prava.si that is run by a man who formerly worked for Nova24TV, a right-wing outlet part-owned by senior members of the SDS.

""In recent days many media have been disclosing new stories and publishing new transactions. Parliamentary inquiries are being initiated in the Western Balkans, whereby all are pointing the finger at you,"" Mahnič said.

According to publicly available information, one parliamentary inquiry has been launched, in Kosovo.

Golob retorted that the largest opposition party could not get over the election defeat on 24 April 2022. ""Everything that you are saying had been launched in the election campaign by you and structures under your direct control,"" he said.

The prime minister recalled that this alleged scandal had been a topic at one of the televised election debates, when Martin Berishaj's name cropped up.

""Google his name and you'll see there is not a single picture of me and him together. I don't know him, I've never met him, and he confirmed that for the media himself,"" Golob said.

Indeed, Berishaj recently told POP TV he did not know Golob and had never met him. ""Regardless of how many times you recycle this fake news, it will remain fake,"" he said.

Golob however stressed that Berishaj did know one Slovenian politician well - SDS leader Janez Janša. ""At the last election he was promising [Janša] the loyalty and support of Kosovo citizens living in Slovenia.""",politics,"['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Government approval rating continues to decline,"Satisfaction with the government's work continues to decline, while dissatisfaction is rising, according to a Vox Populi poll released on Monday.

Satisfaction with the government's work dropped six percentage points over the course of only two weeks, since the last Vox Populi poll, while dissatisfaction grew by 9.4 points.

Distrust toward Prime Minister Robert Golob is increasing as well, with 53.7% of respondents expressing doubts in his decisions. Just over 23% said he enjoyed their trust.

Meanwhile, voters expressed strong support for the parties they voted. The highest average valuation went to New Slovenia (4.21), followed by the Freedom Movement (4.09), the Left and the Democrats (SDS) with 4.06 each and the Social Democrats (SD) with 3.84.

After several turbulent weeks, marked with staffing changes in the government, a testimony by the former Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar against Golob, the expulsion of Mojca Šetinc Pašek from the Freedom Movement and the PM's government idea for a government reshuffle, 48.1% of the respondents said it was time for the coalition to stabilise the situation.

On the other hand, 36.3% of the respondents said it was time for an early election, while 12% believe a new PM designate should be given the chance.

In terms of party ranking, the SDS remains at the top (22.2%, up 3 points), followed by the Freedom Movement (19.9%, down 4 points), NSi (7.5%, down 0.2 points), the SD (7.3%, up 0.3 point) and the Left (6.2%, up 1.3 points).

President calls for use of AI in fight against disinformation (adds),"President Nataša Pirc Musar called for the use of artificial intelligence in the fight against disinformation at a conference on digital sovereignty on Tuesday. ""This is not a commercially interesting project for tech giants, so we have to work on it at an international level,"" the president said.","Describing the fight against disinformation as key for democracy, Pirc Musar noted that the coming elections will be strongly marked by disinformation and fake news, recalling the Israeli group Team Jorge that successfully affected the results of 29 elections by using fake social media profiles to spread misinformation.

The president sees the solution in ""monitoring the digital with the digital"". In the next year she plans to consult AI experts and draft a document to try and influence EU policy.

Pirc Musar welcomed the approach that the EU is taking in AI regulation by creating different measures for different levels of risk. She compared the process with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where legislators tried to regulate without halting progress.

While tech giants were opposed to GDPR at first, they are already calling for a more strict legal framework when it comes to AI, said Pirc Musar. She would invite the companies to join the conversation and help shape the legislation.

Pirc Musar was speaking at DISCO Slovenia, a conference organised by the Today is a New Day, an NGO.

The three-day conference is focusing on topics like digital rights, privacy, artificial intelligence and ownership of technology.

Twelve Dutch embassies in Central Europe and Western Balkans endorsed the conference and provided stipends for 36 attendees.

The head of the European department at the Dutch Foreign Ministry Erik Weststrate addressed the conference and noted the importance of unbiased access to data and its ownership for democracy and the cooperation of individuals and governments.

""Fake news, hate speech, disinformation and artificial intelligence, as well as corporate interests of tech giants can be a serious challenge to the proper functioning of the rule of law and democracy,"" the Dutch embassy said, adding that the Netherlands is supporting the conference ""because it believes in Europe - a flourishing civil society with free and independent media and engaged activists"".","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'science and technology']"
Medical chamber dismisses allegations of illegal euthanasia,"The Medical Chamber rejected recent claims by an assisted dying bill sponsor Andrej Pleterski, who said that euthanasia was being performed in Slovenia illegally.

The Medical Chamber responded in a press release by saying that ""the mission of doctors is to treat patients in line with the medical doctrine and ethics"".

""We can assure patients with full responsibility that in healthcare institutions euthanasia is not happening under any circumstance,"" the chamber added.

In Slovenia euthanasia is a criminal offence of manslaughter or murder, they wrote. Assistance in suicide is also a criminal offence. ""We call on anyone who has information on such an act to immediately inform law enforcement,"" the chamber wrote.

The chamber condemns garnering media attention with scaremongering and untrue statements. By making such statements in public, Pleterski is putting his own credibility under question, the press release reads.

Pleterski also claimed that only a part of the medical profession was opposed to the bill, and that part ""holds in its hands the leadership of healthcare organisations"".

Conference discussing challenges in electricity sector,"Slovenia's electric grid is going through one of the most demanding periods in history, a conference of the Slovenian Committee of Electric Power Engineers heard in Bled on Tuesday. The biggest challenges it faces are digitalisation, lack of staff, green transition and investments.","Addressing the opening of the two-day conference, Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Igor Papič said that the state and the sector will have to invest a lot in new technologies.

The country will increasingly have to rely on renewable sources, above all photovoltaic and nuclear, said the minister.

""We are lagging behind considerably in renewables, the main problem being the development of energy storage. Parallel to developing the system, we must also completed digital transformation,"" said Papič.

He pointed to the lack of staff felt by all industries at the moment. ""The young do not opt for careers in tech, which needs to change, also by a higher degree of inclusion of women.""

Marko Hrast, the president of the Committee of Electric Power Engineers said that global electricity systems are facing great change. ""Globally, this is the biggest connected system of infrastructure humanity ever built.""

The system must be maintained and upgraded in a way that is least detrimental to the environment, Hrast underlined. This can only be achieved if the system is connected to all other systems, he added.

Environmental disasters, economic crises and wars are making the green transition harder, he said, adding this has been very apparent recently, when the entire electricity system, considered robust and unbreakable was shaken by the war in Ukraine.

Aleksander Mervar, director general of the national grid operator ELES, presented last year's results and forecast for the future. Last year, Slovenia imported 30% of the electricity it used, mostly due to upgrades at the Krško nuclear power plant, shut-offs at the TEŠ thermal power plant and poor water conditions for hydro plants.

""Long-term import dependence forecast is inopportune for Slovenia, similar to other countries in the region,"" said Mervar. To reduce dependence on import, Slovenia will have to invest more in the sector, he underlined.

Investments have gone down considerably in the past years, also because of unpaid grid fees, which cost the sector some EUR 100 million which would have otherwise gone into investments.

Mervar also noted that Slovenian electricity companies posted much higher profits in 2022 than in 2021, saying that the cost of electricity is not as high as some claim.

He also talked about the green transition, saying that Slovenia's energy production is very low-carbon in comparison to other countries. The country is under the EU average in terms of emissions in electricity production, and 30% better than Germany, he said.",science and technology,"['politics', 'environmental issue', 'economy, business and finance']"
Human rights association turns to Constitutional Court over bear culling,"The Helsinki Monitor of Slovenia, a Ljubljana-based human rights association, has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court against a recent decision of the Ministry of Natural Resources to allow the culling of 230 brown bears to reduce the population of some 1,100. The association also wants the culling to be suspended.","The complaint was also forwarded to Prime Minister Robert Golob today. Golob was urged to take action against Minister of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Uroš Brežan while he was praised for his initiative to freeze the culling to allow for a public discussion on the issue.

However, the association also criticised Golob for tolerating what it sees as the illegal behaviour of Brežan's ministry, which did not hold a public debate before issuing the decision on the culling of bears, a protected species, last month.

According to the Monitor, Brežan is hiding the decision on the culling from the public, while bears are being culled In the meantime; the association noted that 165 of the 230 bears have already been killed.

The Monitor believes that, as prime minister, Golob has the power to demand that the ministry immediately stop further bear culling and open a public debate.

Brežan told the parliamentary committees on the environment and agriculture on Wednesday that 158 bears had so far been culled based on the April decision.

The Helsinki Monitor of Slovenia proposes that the court obtain the controversial decision that is being implemented ""with empty promises of a public debate sometime in the future when the crime against nature will already have been committed"".

Mass culling of bears such as the ones that happened last year and this year pose a threat to the protected species in Slovenia and does not respect the breeding of bears, the NGO said.

""It is also not clear how the ministry is respecting private forest property with such a blanket decision, or whether it has any permission from the owners for primitive poaching in their forests,"" the complaint reads.

The association claims the ministry is allowing tourist killing of bears, citing a report in the tabloid Slovenske Novice that hunters' associations were paid EUR 10,000 to enable foreigners to hunt bears. It also wonders how foreigners can enter Slovenia armed and shoot bears, and how forest owners and hikers are being protected.

Brežan said on 13 April when issuing the decision on the culling of 230 bears that its purpose was to prevent serious harm and to protect people by reducing the population of brown bears in Slovenia to 800 in the coming years.

He stressed that other options to prevent conflicts with man had also been considered, but that neither relocation to another place in the wild nor keeping bears in captivity was an option due to their large numbers.",environmental issue,"['social issue', 'politics']"

It carried out an additional issue of its RS85 bond, due in October 2050 with a coupon interest rate of 0.4875%, the Finance Ministry said in a press release. The total nominal value of the RS85 bond has increased to about EUR 1.85 billion.","The price was set with a yield of 3.785% and 1.371 points above the referenced German bond due in August 2050, the ministry said.

The 30-year-bond was first issued in October 2020, with the initial issue reaching one billion euro, and has been reissued several times.

The issue was carried out by Barclays, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Erste Group. The majority of buyers come from the UK, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. They are mainly fund managers, banks, treasuries and central banks.

Today's issue was carried out alongside a purchase of outstanding RS83 and RS66 notes, which are due in March and September 2024, respectively.

The ministry announced it bought EUR 17.8 million worth of RS83 notes. Their nominal value is EUR 2.23 million at an interest rate of 0.2%, of which EUR 1.063 billion remains outstanding.

First debate of Anže Logar's platform about economy,"The platform launched by Anže Logar, Slovenia's former foreign minister and MP for the largest opposition party, hosted its first debate on Tuesday to discuss the future development of the Slovenian economy. Logar reiterated that the aim of the platform was not to turn it into a political party but to open up space for discussion.","The first such event, hosted by the Cooperation Platform, featured Blaž Brodnjak, NLB bank chairman, chief supervisor of the Banks' Association and head of AmCham Slovenia, co-founder of high-tech manufacturer Dewesoft Jure Knez, and founder and director of air dome maker Duol Dušan Olaj.

The businessmen talked about their own experiences with economic development and shared their views on the future of the Slovenian economy.

They criticised the high taxation of companies, arguing that Slovenia was lagging behind other countries in the region in terms of stimulating the economy.

Brodnjak sees the future of the Slovenian economy in the desire to succeed, saying that in order to be the biggest possible success story ""ideological barriers"" had to be overcome.

Slovenia has the potential for economic development, but ""after election every Slovenian government should set a foundation that defines the fundamental values we want to cultivate"", said Knez.

Olaj underlined that the country should focus on investing in research, science and technical innovation to step up economic development.

They also discussed several other issues, including population ageing and declining birth rates.

Logar's association, whose full name is Platform Let's Cooperate for the Future, was founded in May and has twelve founding members.","economy, business and finance","['politics', 'economy, business and finance']"
Paper supports action against hate speech,Thursday's commentary in the regional newspaper Primorske Novice welcomes the recommendations issued by the Strategic Council for the Prevention of Hate Speech as well as actions already taken by the government in the combat against hate speech.,"The paper notes that TV Slovenija ran an interview on Sunday in which Matjaž Gams of the Department Of Intelligent Systems at the Jožef Stefan Institute spoke of Hitler's good intentions.

""In this way, [the interviewer] Vida Petrovčič once again managed to create the impression that we live in a society where everyone can afford to do anything they want while crucifying Nika Kovač as the prime heretic of the Slovenian liberal bloc,"" reads the commentary, headlined Nika, We'll Crucify You, referring to the head of the council advising the government on ways to combat hate speech.

The paper finds that while allegations of the Robert Golob government's being inefficient, wasteful and passive may be justified in some points, the government could certainly not be reproached for making a ""colossal progress in the field of human rights"", progress to which the strategic council contributed.

Referring to the 57 recommendations issued by the council, including extending media's accountability to their social media profiles, the paper says that if that means disabling comments, media will do that willingly without reservations.

""Media, including online, are platforms aimed at keeping the public informed rather than serving as a conduit for semi-literate Facebook commentators.""

Asserting that not everyone can afford to do everything they wish in Slovenia's society, the paper also welcomes the recent decision by the Culture Ministry to initiate procedure to remove a far-right association whose head has glorified Hitler from the register of associations.",human interest,"['politics', 'human interest', 'social issue']"
Dnevnik critical of religious act changes,"The newspaper Dnevnik is critical of the ruling coalition in its commentary on Tuesday for cutting the state payment of social contributions for religious workers from 100% to 60%. ""Once again, and this time against its will, the Church has become a political playground where the left and the right will be flexing their ideological muscles.""","Polarisation of society for or against the Church is a tempting tool that politicians are not willing to give up, the paper says under the headline Gospel and Politics.

It is impossible to ignore the lightness with which the politics is playing with the rights of religious communities, a category that enjoys high protection in any democratic country.

""It is also clear this is not about money,"" the difference between the amount paid by the state for those working, for example, for the Roman Catholic Church before and now is only EUR 1.6 million.

""The Golob government is willing to reignite the cultural fight and divide the people over this figure, without establishing a decent dialogue with religious communities and a normal public discussion that could clarify what this would mean for religious workers, such as priests in remote areas, and what it would mean for the state.""

The coalition is even less willing to lend an ear to proposals to overhaul the act, which was drafted in the ""ideologically turbulent 1990s"", so that the Church would be transparently taxed and would no longer have to listen to criticism that it was in a favourable position.

But apparently Slovenia does not have the political maturity for this. It is more likely that the Church will be tossed from one side of the isle to the other. One side will be luring it in with gifts and the other side will strip its privileges the first chance it gets.

Meanwhile the Church will be continually forced to choose sides in order to get funding, instead of enjoying financial stability and being able to focus on its mission: the gospel not politics.",politics,"['religion and belief', 'politics']"
Zavarovalnica Triglav proposes EUR 2.50 dividend for last year,"The management of the insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav will propose at the 6 June AGM a dividend payout for last year of EUR 2.50 gross per share, or a total of EUR 56.8 million. Slightly more than half of net profit of the Triglav group for 2022 would be allocated for dividends, which represents a 6% dividend yield.","Announcing the proposal on Tuesday, Zavarovalnica Triglav said that the proposal exceeded investors' expectations regarding the average 4.3% dividend yield of shares of European insurance companies this year.

While labelling the proposed dividend as ""attractive"", chairman Andrej Slapar was also quoted as saying that the dividend policy nevertheless enabled the Triglav group to sustain medium-term financial stability, further growth and development.

While 2022 was challenging, the group achieved good results and exceeded plans, which was also a result of certain one-off events.

The management and supervisory boards of the insurer have assessed that the company would be able to maintain in the medium term the appropriate level of capital adequacy, which expectedly decreased last year.

The dividend proposal takes into account the estimated current and expected future operating conditions of the group, the anticipated capital needs and the ability of the group to achieve its strategic goals, the release adds.

Zavarovalnica Triglav is expected to publish on 21 April the call for the regular AGM, which is scheduled for 6 June.

Last year, the Triglav group had EUR 1.6 billion in revenue, 10% more than in 2021. Its pre-tax profit was up by 1% to EUR 134.5 million, while net profit dropped by 2% to EUR 110.2 million.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Delo writes about impact of Russian propaganda in Slovenia,The newspaper Delo appeals for empathy with Ukraine in the headline of Monday's commentary as it discusses the impact of Russian war propaganda on Slovenia.,"The paper has talked to Irina Sieidkhanova, a Ukrainian lawyer and journalist from Mariupol who has moved to Kranj from Serbia. Talking about the reach of the Russian war propaganda in the two countries, she says Serbia and Slovenia are worlds apart.

While the Russian propaganda appears to have won in the Balkans, Sieidkhanova says that in Slovenia, despite the many pro-Russian commentaries by anonymous persons on social media, people have mostly not fallen for the claims about the war propagated by Russian propagandists.

""A day after we talked about the weak influence of the Russian propaganda, the flags of Russia and the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics were flown outside the National Assembly where about 30 people protested against incitement to war and anti-Russian propaganda; they sounded like they were spreading Russian propaganda.

""On the internet, in the safe shelter of anonymity, Russian propaganda is spread by many more people than dare to show up at a public rally. The Moscow-born daughter of a Ukrainian and a Dagestani has experienced first-hand the openness of society in Moscow and Mariupol, where she moved when she was 14. Claims that the Nazis persecuted the Russian-speaking residents of Mariupol are a fabrication, the anti-Russian propaganda campaigner insists.

""Until the war, a colourful range of peoples and nationalities lived there, and the vast majority of them spoke Russian. Her Mariupol is now gone, thousands of people in that city murdered by the very people who came to defend them from imaginary butchers,"" reads the commentary Let Us Be Compassionate Even in Shelter of Anonymity.","unrest, conflicts and war","['politics', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"
Oštro launches asset monitor for officials,"The news portal Oštro has launched an online database sourcing publicly available data on the wealth of Slovenian political officials. Oštro said it launched the Wealth Detector because the Corruption Prevention Commission (KPK) is the only body that knows how much officials are worth, and there is only one staff member who keeps watch.","Today, the portal released information about the wealth of government members and will continue adding into the database in autumn and next year.

Out of the 21 cabinet members, initially only one, Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar, filled out a form it received from Oštro. Upon further request, three more responded. Four allowed Oštro to see their tax returns.

The prime minister's office forwarded only descriptive information: the prime minister has savings in the bank and mutual fund investments, he owns a car, an orchard, an olive grove and several plots scattered around Kromberk, he has no loans.

In an effort to gain a comprehensive overview, Oštro wanted to check the correctness of the data it received with the KPK, but the body rejected the request. The portal addressed the same request to the Information Commissioner, which turned it down as well.

Oštro says that only data on the changing of assets are publicly accessible under the act on integrity and corruption prevention. ""But the published data are sparse and imperfect. A single staff member of the KPK keeps an eye on the assets of some 22,000 officials.""

Before Oštro started its project, six ministries had not reported to the KPK information about companies connected to government ministers and these have not been restricted from cooperation with relevant state bodies.

The ministries told Oštro that they had failed to do so because they had not known or because they had overlooked the issue. At least four ministries reported such companies to the KPK after receiving enquiries from Oštro.

Oštro believes that ""the available data in their current form, do not correspond either to the contents of the act or its purpose: to strengthen the transparency of officials' dealings and the public's trust.""","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Speaker says Slovenia will keep advocating North Macedonia's EU accession,"Parliamentary Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič reiterated Slovenia's support for North Macedonia's EU accession as she received her Macedonian counterpart Talat Xhaferi on Thursday. It's important that countries which share values and part of their history join forces and become an important player in the international community, she said.","The two speakers are happy that their countries' relations are excellent across the board.

Slovenia and North Macedonia have been cooperating and supporting each other for a number of years, Klakočar Zupančič said, noting that more and more Macedonian students were arriving in Slovenia where they had the same status as their Slovenian peers.

Xhaferi said that Macedonian students found it important to be able to obtain a degree in an EU member state.

""I'm happy that the Macedonian diaspora is actively involved in the social and political life in Slovenia and the EU. I'm confident that this will contribute to a further upgrade in bilateral relations between the two countries and in the (EU) integration process,"" Xhaferi said.

""Slovenia has been, is and will always be striving to see North Macedonia become a full-fledged EU member,"" said Klakočar Zupančič.

It is important that countries that are cooperating and sharing the same values and a part of their history join forces and, within the EU framework, become an important player in the international community, she said.

The Slovenian speaker agrees with the position that making ultimatums about the EU accession of countries meeting basic conditions is not the right approach.

Xhaferi thanked Slovenia for its support in his country's EU and NATO accession efforts ""at the very moments the country needed it the most"".

""The European process, particularly the Western Balkans' prospects, is an important strategic decision for the union's safe stability and future,"" he said.

Moreover, Klakočar Zupančič is happy that the parliamentary friendship group between Slovenia and North Macedonia exists and has many members. Cooperation between the countries' parliaments will help boost economic and cultural exchange, she added.

She is hopeful that North Macedonia will support Slovenia's bid for non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council and expects bilateral cooperation to continue.

Xhaferi and his delegation arrived in Slovenia on Wednesday and will stay until Friday. In the afternoon, he will be received by President Nataša Pirc Musar, Prime Minister Robert Golob and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajo. On Friday, he is scheduled to meet Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković.",politics,['politics']
Slovenia gets first digital mobile operator,"Slovenia will get its first digital mobile operator as Austrian telecommunication group A1 launches re:do this evening. Re:do is part of A1, but has its own team, while A1 Slovenia will continue to provide the same services to individuals and companies as so far.","Mobile users will be able to switch to re:do via a mobile app and use either a digital or regular SIM card, which can be ordered home or bought at Petrol and OMV filling stations. Users can keep their existing number or pick a new one.

A single mobile package will be available for EUR 15 a month, allowing unlimited calls, messages and data transfer in Slovenia, and unlimited calls and messages and 14 GB of data transfer in the EU.

Slovenia is the first market where re:do is being launched. According to Alexander Kuchar, who is in charge of technology and business development at A1 Group, the Slovenian market is suitable as a testing ground because it is demanding and has a strong competition.

A1 surveys have also found Slovenians to be very digitally skilled, he said. ""If we're successful here, we'll be successful in other markets.""

The goal is to attract 100,000 users in three years, said re:do CEO Iliyan Dimitrov.

Re:do targets people who want to run as many errands as possible online and who like to be free, as re:do subscription can be cancelled any time.

Alexander Kuchar said re:do wanted to offer more freedom and transparency without hidden costs. Any comments and proposals for improvements will be collected at the re:do website.

Average gas price for households reached EUR 0.099 per kilowatt hour, while the average price of gas for non-households dropped to EUR 0.060 per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT.

The average price of electricity for households reached EUR 0.194 per kilowatt hour, and dropped to EUR 0.216 per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT, for non-households.

In part, the prices were affected by the government's measures designed to mitigate the effects of rising energy prices, including temporary caps and suspensions of some duties, the Statistics Office said.

Golob and Niinistö discuss Slovenia's planned defence purchases,"Prime Minster Robert Golob met Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Lithuania on Tuesday to discuss Slovenia's plans to purchase APCs after the country withdrew from a deal with the OCCAR to buy eight-wheeled Boxers. Finland is a possible supplier, but no decision has been made yet, said Golob.","""The Finns could be one of the suppliers, but that's it,"" Golob said, stressing that the decision on the purchase has to be made by the government.

He also pointed out that Slovenia is not talking directly to industry or through intermediaries. All talks are held at intergovernmental level, he said.

Increasing defence spending is one of the main topics on the first day of the NATO summit, which started in Vilnius today.

NATO leaders are expected to approve a new commitment under which 2% of GDP will no longer be the upper spending limit, but the lower one.

""It won't necessarily be easy to get there, we know that,"" Golob said as he arrived at the summit.

He assured the government will work to increase defence spending in every budget to reach the target by 2030, but pointed to an objective obstacle in the form of EU's new fiscal rules.

""I'm convinced that if the increase in defence spending is not properly addressed in the fiscal rules, not only Slovenia, but most EU countries will have really big challenges to meet this target,"" Golob said.

NATO's recent estimates show that eleven of the 31 NATO members will spend 2% of their GDP or more on defence this year, while Slovenia will spend 1.35%.","economy, business and finance","['politics', 'economy, business and finance']"
Extension of caps on electricity and gas prices expected soon,"The government is unofficially planing to extend the cap on electricity and gas retail prices for households, small business customers and small and medium-sized companies until the end of the year, as is already the case when it comes to public institutions. It is not yet clear when the cabinet will decide on the matter.","Economy Minister Matjaž Han said at a forum event on Tuesday that the government would this week extend the cap on energy prices for small and medium-sized enterprises until the end of the year, while the Infrastructure Ministry has not been able to confirm any timeline for the STA as yet.

Government officials indicated on several occasions last year that the price cap regulation, which expires in mid-2023, would be extended until the end of the year. According to unofficial information, prices will be set at the same levels as now.

The government capped electricity and gas prices for households, small business consumers and some protected consumers for a year from 1 September 2022. It later also limited electricity and gas prices for SMEs, public institutions, utilities, agencies and funds, and for municipalities.

For households and consumption in shared premises, the maximum price per megawatt hour (MWh) is set at EUR 98 for the single daily tariff. For non-household customers with a connection capacity equal to or less than 43 kilowatts (kW), the cap is EUR 124 per MWh for the single tariff.

Moreover, the gas price cap for protected household users and for distributors of heat for households was set at EUR 73 per MWh and for social service centres, kindergartens, primary schools, health centres and small business customers at EUR 79 per MWh.

For micro, small and medium-sized companies, the single daily electricity tariff is capped at EUR 195 per MWh.

The caps for the prices of electricity and gas for public institutions, public utilities, public agencies, public funds and municipalities have already been put in place for the whole of 2023. The single electricity tariff is capped at EUR 186 per MWh and the gas tariff at EUR 95 per MWh.

Dejan Paravan of GEN Energija, which owns the Slovenian half of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, told the press last week that the current retail electricity market prices are lower than the regulated prices for SMEs and public institutions, but higher than the regulated prices for households and small business customers.","economy, business and finance","['politics', 'social issue', 'economy, business and finance']"

"Slovenia introducing checks on border with Croatia, Hungary on Saturday (adds)","Slovenia will introduce police checks at the borders with Croatia and Hungary on Saturday for at least ten days, the government said on Thursday, in a decision that comes after Italy announced the same measure at the border with Slovenia as of Saturday.","Explaining the decision, the government cited heightened security risks due to organised crime and the escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

Law enforcement information indicates organised crime in the Western Balkans is surging, with organised groups becoming increasingly connected and intertwined.

Moreover, members of various terrorist and extremist movements and groups are withdrawing from conflict zones ""to avoid the consequences of their actions or even with the intention of jeopardising our security and stability,"" the government said.

Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar, who was in Luxembourg today for an EU ministerial on the situation in the Schengen Area, said that people along the border would be able to continue to live normally despite the checks being introduced.

""My instruction to the police commissioner was to ensure normal life and normal crossing for the people who live along the border,"" he said.

The police said there will be 14 checkpoints for international travellers, 12 on the border with Croatia and 2 on the Hungarian border. On smaller crossings only EU citizens will be allowed to cross, and some points will be reserved for locals with special permits.

The minister apologised in advance to all citizens and residents of Slovenia who will be stopped and will have to show their IDs, ""because the terrorist threat is still high in Europe.""

He assured his Croatian counterpart Davor Božinović that Slovenia will adapt the measure to the people living near the border, and expects Italy to do the same after the country said it will temporarily introduce control on the border with Slovenia as of Saturday.

""I once again told Italian Minister Matteo Piantedosi that I want Italy to ensure the normal flow of people living along the border,"" Poklukar said, noting that the border closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic made life at the border ""unbearable"".

All three interior ministers will talk about the issue at a meeting in Trieste in early November.

Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said that the announced control at the internal Schengen border by Slovenia must remain an exception introduced only as a last resort.

He attributed the decision to the migration crisis and an increased terrorist threat related to the escalation of violence in the Middle East, noting that consultations with the neighbouring countries concerned was of key importance.

""It should be noted that it is a temporary measure and that it must remain an exception, introduced only as an extreme measure which must be subjected to strict conditions, especially regarding implementation and duration,"" he said.

As the opposition commented on the measure yesterday, when the information was still unofficial, Democrats (SDS) head Janez Janša said that apparently even the largest sceptics had realised that the situation was serious.

Pointing to what is going on in the Middle East, Janša said that Slovenia should have made the move even before Italy had decided for the measure. The government should also help Croatia control the external Schengen border with Bosnia, he added.

The New Slovenia (NSi) said the decision was the right one, while wondering whether this will be enough, and noted that it had been warning about the risk months ago. ""We said that removing [border] obstacles is a wrong signal to migrants.""

Both the SDS and NSi noted the risk of refugees from the war zones possibly also including members of terrorist groups.

The Left, a junior coalition partner, is reserved to the measure, as it affects the lives of the people along the border. Such measures should be taken ""with a grain of salt"", as in the past they had led to razor wire fence on the border, said MP Matej T. Vatovec.

The party can understand the possible fear in people, but Slovenia also needs to think about making serious political steps that will lead to peace in the Middle East, where the situation poses the risk of a new migration wave, he added.

Control at the internal border, such as announced by Slovenia and Italy, is currently implemented by nine EU member states, mainly due to the migration crisis and the threat of terrorism.

Commenting on the introduction of border checks by several members, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said that although border controls may be warranted, they hinder free movement within the EU and should be avoided.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Izola Marina expanding to claim leading spot in Slovenian Istria,A new pier has been recently built at the Izola marina in what is an addition that increased the number of berths to nearly 800 and made the marina in the seaside resort Izola the largest marina in Slovenian Istria.,"The EUR 2.3 million investment resulted in the new pier, providing berths for vessels up to 12 metres in length. The Izola marina now has more berths than its rival in Portorož, another popular seaside resort in Slovenia, the municipality of Izola told the STA.

""Currently, there are more than 600 vessels in the Izola marina,"" Vladimir Gavran, director of the marina operator Porting, told the STA, adding that there was a lot of interest in booking berths there, including among foreigners, who are mainly from German-speaking countries.

Due to inflation and higher costs, Porting raised prices last week. The increase in berthing fees of some 5% is less than half of the increase in the company's costs, so marina users will not shoulder the burden of price hikes alone, Gavran said.

After two years of Covid, the municipality is now seeing the return to 2019 levels or even an improvement on pre-Covid indicators.

In the future, the local authorities seek to spruce up the marina to make it even more user-friendly now that guests are returning.

Last year saw a 24% increase in arrivals and a 16% increase in tourist overnight stays compared to 2021. Slovenian guests accounted for 57% of total arrivals and 62% of total overnight stays, the municipality said, noting that foreign guests were also returning.

Pahor, who met Napolitano on several occasions, also expressed his condolences on X and thanked Napolitano for his efforts to promote friendship, reconciliation and good relations between Slovenians and Italians. ""I will keep him in my noblest memory,"" he added.

Napolitano died on Friday at the age of 98 in a hospital in Rome. He had had health problems for a long time and his condition had deteriorated in recent days.

The former president contributed to the thawing of relations between Slovenia and Italy, including by paying a visit to the National Hall in Trieste in 2010, together with the then presidents of Slovenia and Croatia, Danilo Türk and Ivo Josipović. The trio called for overcoming the tragedies of the past. When he visited Slovenia in 2012, Napolitano became the first foreign president to address the National Assembly.",politics,['politics']
"President talks Ukraine, W Balkans, culture and sport with German counterpart (adds)","In what is her second visit abroad after being sworn in, President Nataša Pirc Musar met her German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin on Thursday. Discussing topical issues such as climate change, the Western Balkans and the war in Ukraine, the pair pointed to Slovenia's and Germany's shared positions and excellent relations.","Steinmeier said he was glad to host the first woman president of the country with which Germany had long fostered a deep friendship that should be strengthened and developed further.

He added that despite its small size, Slovenia has achieved great things ""with its smarts, patience, persuasiveness, and the ability to form alliances and make compromise"".

The pair discussed global challenges, with Steinmeier recalling Pirc Musar saying as she was sworn in that courage is not the absence of fear but rather the ability to face one's fears head on.

Both condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it was Russia who was the aggressor. Pirc Musar said that when the time comes, Slovenia would help rebuild Ukraine, also by providing de-mining help.

The pair avoided commenting on potential peace initiatives or further military aid to Ukraine, with Steinmeier underscoring the German Leopard 2 battle tanks need to be delivered as soon as possible.

He underlined last year's successful cooperation between Slovenia and Germany in supplying Ukraine with firearms, and Pirc Musar said Europe should remain unanimous is supporting the war-stricken country.

Slovenia can not offer Ukraine large-scale support, she said, adding that taking into account the size of its population, the country is already one of the five biggest donors, having provided EUR 23 million-worth of aid.

Discussing the Western Balkans' integration efforts, the German president welcomed Pirc Musar's engagement in the Brdo-Brijuni Process, which her predecessor Borut Pahor initiated.

Both said it was time to overcome nation-dividing ideologies, and turn focus to climate change, biodiversity and young people.

The Slovenian president noted that in the last 15 years, 4 million people left the Western Balkans and that these countries have to be aware that ""they need to remain functional,"" which was especially challenging for Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Pirc Musar confirmed that the next Brdo-Brijuni meeting will take place in North Macedonia. During her recent visit, Croatian President Zoran Milanović agreed to let her choose the main topic, she said. Steinmeier shared her view that the Brdo-Brijuni Process does not conflict with the Berlin process, a German initiative.

Talking biodiversity and climate change, the presidents underscored cooperation, with Pirc Musar pointing to Slovenia's involvement in Germany's automotive industry in light of efforts towards a sustainable, green future.

The two also noted that Slovenia will be the guest of honour at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the of its kind in Europe, in October this year.

""Whether it be culture, sport or politics, we are happy to have you by our side,"" Steinmeier said, while Pirc Musar noted ""books were weapons, and culture and art can, in many aspects, move mountains.""

With business diplomacy being an important part of her foreign affairs activities, Pirc Musar also met with representatives of the German business sector.

She concluded her visit at Berlin's Neues Museum, where artefacts that were found on modern-day Slovenia's territory are exhibited, her office said.",politics,"['unrest, conflicts and war', 'politics', 'politics', 'sport']"
Divača-Koper railway closes for four days,"Passenger and cargo rail transport between the port of Koper and the railway hub of Divača, south-west, will come to a standstill between Saturday morning and Tuesday evening to allow workers building a new railway between the two towns to build a 900-metre track on the existing route to make room for the new, 27-km Koper-Divača track.","At Divača, the existing and new tracks meet, so 900 metres of the existing track will be slightly moved, said 2TDK, a company in charge of building what is known as the second Koper-Divača rail track, one of the biggest infrastructure investments in Slovenia's history.

This will clear the area so that workers can continue building the second Koper-Divača track in the direction from Divača towards the Lokev tunnel.

Once the 900-metre track is fully moved to a new location, transport will resume on the Koper-Divača route on Tuesday evening.

In the meantime, passengers and cargo will be redirected to roads while part of the cargo will wait in the port of Koper for the route to reopen, said Primorske Novice, the Koper-based newspaper.

2TDK said full closure of the Koper-Divača rail route is needed to do all the works, from moving rail tracks and points to all signalling equipment.",labour,"['labour', 'economy, business and finance']"
SDS files ousting motion against health minister (adds),"The Democratic Party (SDS), the bigger of the two opposition parties, filed into parliamentary procedure on Thursday an ousting motion against Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan, citing deteriorating situation in public healthcare, failure to implement reform in line with the ministry's own timeline and failure to act diligently.","The motion, which the SDS announced on Monday, accuses the minister of making the waiting periods for healthcare services even longer than they had been.

When he took over as minister in June 2022, Bešič Loredan promised to cut waiting times, the SDS notes in the motion.

But despite spending some EUR 137 million to achieve this, the number of people waiting for treatment beyond an admissible period of time has increased by nearly 50,000 between 1 September 2022 and 31 March 2023, it adds.

""Fact is that funds coming from taxpayers' pockets were not used economically and the measure designed to cut waiting times did not have the wanted effect,"" the motion says.

The SDS is also critical of Bešič Loredan for claiming the measure was a success because the waiting times had not gotten extremely long.

The 12-point motion also accuses the minister of having broken a number of promises regarding the ministry's reform timeline.

Among other things, Bešič Loredan promised to have drafted systemic legislation to address lack of GPs and overhaul the management of public healthcare institution by the end of June.

Moreover, he promised to have drafted a new wage tier for healthcare by April and has also failed to carry out a structural overhaul of the public health insurance, the ZZZS.

""Time has run out, who will take political responsibility?"" the party wonders, also claiming that the minister is unsuccessful in combating corruption.

The SDS moreover labelled as a fiasco the establishment of a strategic council for healthcare overhaul, which first worked at the ministry, but then a new one was established by the prime minister's office. The latter is headed by Erik Brecelj, a surgeon who has often been a vocal critic of the minister.

The SDS says this indicates a rift in the team that promised a major breakthrough in healthcare, listing a number of minister's associates who left their jobs.

The opposition party is also critical of the government's plan to abolish top-up health insurance, establish clinics for those who lost their GPs and make changes to the emergency services network.

The SDS believes that the minister's actions have led to a deterioration of the healthcare system, violations of the citizens' constitutional right to healthcare, limited access to healthcare services and that they undermined the role of health minister to the point where he has lost the trust of the public.

When the motion was announced earlier this week, the coalition parties, as well as New Slovenia (NSi), the other opposition party, said they would not endorse it. However, the Left, a junior coalition party, said it was time to discuss Bešič Loredan's performance.

This is the fourth ousting motion filed since the incumbent government was sworn in in June 2022. The first was filed against Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar, who stayed on but later resigned over a dispute with Prime Minister Robert Golob.

This was followed by a motion against Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, who survived the vote as well. Earlier this year, the SDS also filed a motion against the entire government.

Bešič Loredan is the fifth health minister to be targetted by an ousting motion since Slovenia gained independence 32 years ago.",health,"['politics', 'health']"
Italian wins maintenance payment relief dispute in Slovenia,"The Supreme Court has sided with an Italian appellant in an administrative dispute over the exercise of maintenance payment relief, ordering the Financial Administration to re-examine the case and enable him to exercise the relief. The court found violations of the provisions on the free movement of workers in the EU in the relevant Slovenian law.","The worker who had initiated the administrative dispute lives in Italy and gets all his income from employment in Slovenia, where he also makes advance payments of personal income tax.

When he wanted to exercise the maintenance payment relief in his income tax return, he could not do so either in Italy or in Slovenia.

In accordance with the Slovenian Personal Income Tax Act, a tax resident of another EU member state who receives income from employment in Slovenia is eligible for maintenance payment relief only if their income obtained in Slovenia represents at least 90% of their total taxable income in the tax year, while they are not taxed in the country of their residence.

However, the Supreme Court has ruled that this provision is in violation of Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which guarantees its citizens the free movement of workers.

It is true that the country of tax residence is the one that is obliged to grant such tax benefits to a person liable for personal income tax, but when it is not able to do so, the personal and family circumstances of the taxpayer must be taken into account when they are taxed in the country of employment, the court added in the ruling published on Wednesday.

According to the court, a taxpayer has the right to have their personal and family situation properly taken into account, regardless of how the member states of residence and employment divide this obligation among themselves.

It said specifically regarding the appellant in question that, as a tax resident of another EU member state, he was in a worse position than persons liable for personal income tax who are residents of Slovenia.

What is more, the Italian was also worse off compared to persons liable for personal income tax in Italy, because in the given circumstances he paid more income tax than he would have if he had generated his income in that country.",lifestyle and leisure,"['politics', 'economy, business and finance']"
Government moves to freeze top-up health insurance premiums,The government adopted on Thursday a decree that paves the way for a freezing as of 1 May of the top-up health insurance premium charged by private insurers as part of a mutual insurance scheme. The EUR 35 ceiling comes as a scrapping of the current top-up system altogether was set in motion in the wake of an announced hike in the premiums.,"The limiting of the monthly premiums to a maximum of EUR 35.67 will formally be confirmed with a follow-up decree to be adopted on Friday, and the ceiling will presumably be in force until the law abolishing the top-up insurance scheme is passed, Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan told the press.

""This ceiling corresponds to the highest premium paid by citizens for supplementary health insurance today,"" the minister said. He stressed the importance of the additional payments for the health system, while also speaking of the need to respond to the 30% hike announced for May by one of the private insurers that would be followed by other insurers.

""Thereby we are of course siding with the people, as the government is shouldering everything that is going to happen in the health system, the cost increases and everything else,"" Bešič Loredan said. The health system is getting more expensive, but it is unacceptable for top-up insurance prices to change, he added.

While still being ready to talk and cooperate with private insurers, the minister said the onus was on the insurers and that things could have taken a different course had the insurers approached the ministry before announcing the hikes and had done so ""with the awareness that supplementary health insurance is one of the strong pillars in the financing of public healthcare and not merely an insurance product"".

Because the insurers wanted to transfer the burden of the higher costs onto the people ""we needed to react and we did"", Bešič Loredan added about the top-up health insurance purse, estimated to be worth around EUR 600 million a year.

The premiums ceiling comes a day after the ruling coalition party, the Freedom Movement, tabled a legislative proposal that takes private insurers out of the equation by abolishing current top-up insurance and by instead introducing a new 35-euro monthly mandatory levy. The money would flow to ZZZS, the public health insurer, which already manages obligatory health insurance.",health,"['politics', 'health']"
Farmers stage another mass rally against restrictive policies (adds),"Farmers from around the country gathered in Ljubljana Tuesday for their second rally in a month to protest against environmental and other restrictions they say are making farming nearly impossible. ""We've had enough,"" trade unionist Anton Medved said on behalf of several thousand farmers who participated in the rally.","While police have not yet provided an update on the number of protesters, they said between 2,000 and 3,000 were expected in the capital. Medved, head of the Trade Union of Slovenian Farmers spoke of several thousand protestors, as well as of at least 1,500 tractors - these were mostly expected at assembly points on the outskirts of Ljubljana, but some have also been driving past the parliament building and around the city, causing major traffic disruptions.

""The farmer is king on his land. When a farmer protests, the country is already bleeding,"" Medved said, recalling that the farmers' union, together with other NGOs working in the interests of agriculture, was protesting because the situation in farming was no longer bearable. He pointed to environmental restrictions, tax burdens, unreasonable legislation ""written by some extreme environmentalists, far away from farms"".

The rally is a follow-up to a 24 March protest, after which a task force was formed with the government to conduct negotiations. The farmers walked away from the talks after two weeks, announcing a new rally and a stepping up of activities if needed. They said the talks did not meet their expectations and that proposed amendments to the Animal Protection Act that envisage authorised animal protection advisers for breeders had been the final straw.

Their main demands include the adjusting of new environmental rules so as to stay within realistic limits still allowing farming, a re-examination and reduction of Natura 2000-protected areas, the refraining from new taxes, clear and simple rules and the adjustment of direct payments and other funds they receive to cope with inflation.

They also want to see a reduction in the population of carnivores and the immediate start of effective population management. They are calling for legislation to protect prime agricultural land and preserve it for food production, for livestock farming to be considered as the basis for sustainable farming, and for a full scrapping of the regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products at national level.

""Since our voice is not being heard, our comments and observations are not being taken into account, and the public perceives farming organisations as agreeing with many of the restrictive legislative measures, there is no other way than for us to speak up in a loud and clear manner,"" Medved moreover said as he addressed the rally that culminated in the square in front of the parliament building.

""We are here today because we want to preserve our right to farm. We demand viable working conditions and fair policies,"" he added, stressing that farmers were united to an extent not seen in a long time and that the government ""stands warned it needs to work for the benefit of agriculture and find solutions for the farmer and the consumer"".

Borut Florjančič, head of the Slovenian Association of Cooperatives, also argued there would be no food security in Slovenia if farm land was not protected. He spoke of ""Slovenian officials - deciding in an opaque and autocratic manner and blindly nodding to demands coming from offices in Brussels - depriving Slovenian farmers of their place in the world, their families of the future, Slovenian nature of its guardian, and Slovenian citizens of our home-grown food"".

Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS) president Roman Žveglič said that both experts and farmers needed to be included in the drafting of laws. ""It is true that in chess, the pawn is usually sacrificed first, but it is only the pawn that can be promoted to a queen,"" he noted.

Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Irena Šinko responded by saying farmers had the right to protest, but she feels it will be possible to come to an agreement in talks expected after the May Day holidays on the basis of a ministry proposal sent to them last Thursday.

The list of the solutions proposed includes the possibility of a voluntary implementation of protective regimes in Natura 2000 areas this year, with Šinko adding these areas presently could not be reduced, looser permanent grassland provisions, as well as higher quotas and looser carnivore culling regimes for the coming two years.

The minister moreover rejected claims that the envisaged animal protection advisers for breeders would be visiting farmers' barns and courtyards. According to Šinko, they would merely warn inspectors about specific complaints, while the inspectors would then act in line with their powers.",labour,"['politics', 'labour']"
Večer sees serious work ahead for Slovenia in the UN,"Slovenia, which won a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2024-2025, is in for some serious work already in October, when it becomes an observer, the newspaper Večer says on Tuesday under the headline The Game Is Getting Serious.","""Serious work - if Slovenia really wants to be independent, transparent, cohesive and accountable in world politics - will require a great deal of know-how, experience and patience, but above all, it will require not falling for the tricks that the superpowers will surely serve up from all sides.""

The paper says that firstly ""our diplomats will have to bear in mind that the unilateral world no longer exists and that multilateralism is being born with anguish"".

During its candidacy Slovenia showed it is well aware of this. It communicated with everyone and, above all, it seemed that its candidacy was not simply the result of a regional grouping such as the EU, or even of a defence alliance such as NATO. This is one of the reasons why it received an overwhelming 153 votes out of 190 in June.

Interestingly, Slovenia also plans to expand its mission at the UN led by Ambassador Boštjan Malovrh. The special mission for Slovenia's non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council will be headed by Samuel Žbogar. There is no doubt that both of them contributed significantly to the outcome of the June vote, but most non-permanent members in the Security Council do not have special missions.

""In total, we will have as many as 30 diplomatic representatives in New York. Well, yes, it may show that we are serious about the challenge, but it may also be more trivial. Malovrh was appointed head of mission in New York by the previous Janša government, so the current Golob government does not necessarily trust him enough, and in a sense wanted to downgrade him.""

Večer also says that ahead of the 78th session of the UN General Assembly, to be attended by President Nataša Pirc Musar and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, the Foreign Ministry announced something significant. It warned ""against unrealistic expectations about the role Slovenia will be able to play in the Security Council, especially regarding a possible intervention to end the war in Ukraine"".

""If such expectations exist, they are unrealistic, but it is a different matter if Slovenia is buying itself an alibi in advance that it will do nothing for peace in Ukraine. Because that does not suit the US or, for that matter, Russia. In this way, unfortunately, it would turn its back on many of the countries that gave it its vote in June,"" concludes the paper.",politics,['politics']
Coalition announces changes to three health laws,"The coalition has announced changes to three umbrella healthcare laws that are expected to enter public consultation by the end of November. The aim is to increase healthcare accessibility and quality, said the coalition's deputy groups on Wednesday, after a civil initiative put forward its own proposal to improve the situation.","Responding to the emergency bill proposed by the Voice of the People, the deputy groups of the Freedom Movement, the Social Democrats and the Left announced changes to the Health Services Act, the Medical Services Act and the Health Care and Health Insurance Act.

The Health Ministry is preparing amendments whose goal will be to strengthen medical teams at GP offices and reduce administrative work in order to improve the quality of health services.

The changes will also aim to step up oversight over doctors who work for different health providers, usually both in the public and private health systems, to ensure everything is by the book, the coalition said in a press release, noting that most of the civil initiative's proposals were aligned with either the proposals in the making or the already implemented measures.

The Voice of the People unveiled its own bill in mid-September. Its members said at the time that if the coalition did not decide to support and table the bill, they would start collecting signatures to do it themselves.

The 60-day time frame to collect voter signatures will start on 10 October, the organisation's representative Jaša Jenull told the STA today.

According to the Voice of the People, its bill is designed to ensure access to a GP for everyone, cut waiting times and stop ""the deliberate dismantling of the public health system"".

Not satisfied with the coalition's response, the civil initiative announced a protest and a press conference for Friday, saying that the past year had been marked with unmet deadlines and measures that had either had no effect or had further aggravated the situation.",health,"['politics', 'crime, law and justice', 'health']"
Disgraced priest Rupnik co-celebrates Mass despite restrictions,"Despite numerous restrictions imposed on him due to severe allegations of sexual abuse of nuns, Slovenian Jesuit Marko Rupnik, 68, continues giving sermons and co-celebrating Mass, according to the Italian newspaper Domani.","The paper says online that last Sunday Rupnik co-celebrated Mass in Basilica of St Praxedes in Rome, ignoring the ban on public ministerial and sacramental activity.

It says that at least until 22 January, he also gave sermons at Santa Prassede, while a few days ago he guided a group of visitors to his mosaics at the Archbasilica of John the Evangelist in the Lateran.

Restrictions on him were imposed before accounts of his alleged sexual, spiritual and psychological abuse appeared in the Italian media last December.

Apart from a ban on public ministerial and sacramental activity, he is banned from engaging on public communication, pursuing his artistic activity and leaving the Italian region of Lazio.

According to Domani, Rupnik rejected answering the newspaper's questions after Sunday's mass at Santa Prassede, which was attended by senior staff from the Aletti Centre.

Rupnik's superior in the Jesuit religious order Johan Verschueren explained for the Catholic news agency ACI Prensa that Rupnik is allowed to co-celebrate Mass ""within the Centro Aletti, which is his inner circle, his community"".

Slovenia's economy expanded by 5.4% in 2022,"Slovenia's economy expanded by 5.4% last year, however by the last quarter of the year GDP growth slowed down to an annual rate of 0.2%, fresh data released by the Statistics Office shows.","The office noted that most of GDP components grew at a faster rate in the first half of 2022 than they did in the second half.

Growth was driven by final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation, while external trade had a negative impact because imports grew at a faster rate than exports. The external trade surplus amounted to EUR 961 million in 2022, which compares to EUR 3.31 billion the year before.

Seasonally adjusted GDP, a gauge used in an EU-wide comparison, increased by 5.7% in 2022. It rose by 1.3% in the final quarter year-on-year and increased by 0.8% compared to the quarter before.

In terms of quarter-on-quarter comparison, GDP contracted only in the third quarter last year, by 1.3% from the previous quarter.

In the final quarter, domestic expenditure increased by 1.2% year-on-year; household consumption expenditure rose by 2.6% and gross fixed capital formation increased by 5.9%.

In the final quarter of the year, both exports and imports contracted year-on-year in what was the first decrease since the 4th quarter of 2020. Exports decreased by 2.5% and imports by 1.5%. The contribution of external trade balance to GDP growth was negative by 0.9 of a percentage point.

Changes in inventories also had a negative impact on GDP growth.

Total value added increased by 1.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

Construction, and professional, scientific, technical, administrative and support services contributed the most to the total value added. The most prominent decline, at a rate of 6.3%, was recorded in joint activities of mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and water supply. For these activities, this was the first decrease in the last two years.

"New season at MGL theatre focuses on changes in nature, society","The Ljubljana City Theatre (MGL) is launching a new season that will be focused on the ongoing changes in nature and society, and will address some burning issues with a total of twelve premieres, starting on 15 September with The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco.","As MGL artistic director Barbara Hieng Samobor noted at a press conference on Thursday, the new theatre season on the main stage will be launched by Ionesco's 80-year-old text in an interpretation by director Diego de Brea.

De Brea said that the play, which is considered one of the finest examples of the theatre of the absurd, is understood today more as a depiction of a difficult, hopeless and sad everyday life.

Singled out by the theatre as an interesting show in terms of genre and organisation is the Pohorje Battalion project, directed by Jernej Lorenci in cooperation with Croatian playwright Dino Pešut.

In what is an attempt to reconstruct the legendary Slovenian WWII Partisan unit, Lorenci said that he wanted to use the play to stop the ""process of oblivion and simplification, which can lead to mythology or even ideology"".

Co-produced with the Celje City Theatre, the project will first be staged in Celje on 26 September, and then at the MGL on 8 January next year.

Janusz Kica will meanwhile put on the main stage the 1985 black comedy West Pier by French dramatist Bernard-Marie Koltes, set in a lonely place near New York that serves as a meeting point for people from various social classes.

The work that used to be visionary is reality today, Kica said. The play will see its premiere at the MGL on 12 October.

Coming to the main stage on 26 October is the psychological thriller Rupture by Rrose Selavy, a ""master of unpredictable twists"", directed by Jan Krmelj.

The play, which follows the true life story of two environmental activists who are followed and eventually killed by the state, is documentary, but also poetic and aesthetic, Krmelj said.

Žiga Divjak and Gregor Zorc announced the futuristic spectacle Future, staged in cooperation with the Belgrade Drama Theatre.

The international co-production draws inspiration from Kim Stanley Robinson's novel The Ministry for the Future, in which a heat wave kills millions of people. The premiere in Belgrade is scheduled for 15 December, and at the MGL on 2 February.

The repertoire on the main stage will be rounded-off on 28 March next year by Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It, directed by Juš Zidar.

According to the dramaturge Eva Mahkovic, the play will talk about the duality, which Shakespeare created with the events in the Ardennes Forest, and which provides for a space of freedom in contrast to the environment outside the forest.

The season on the small stage will be launched in September by the comedy Neighbours, directed by Tijana Zinajić, and based on a 2014 German film, which was later adapted to stage by its author Ralf Westhoff.

Zinajić said that the play is about a collision between two generations, which features many humorous situations, while noting the importance of intergenerational coexistence.

Arsenic and Old Lace, a 1939 comedy by Joseph Kesselring directed by young theatre artist Nina Ramšak Marković, will premiere on 27 October, and will be put in a modern cultural environment while retaining its black and eccentric humour.

For 16 November, the MGL announces Medusa, an original project by actress Karin Komljanec and Nebojša Pop-Tasić, a classical philologist by education, in which the ancient Greek myth will be set in the modern world, and also speak about body image.

Jean-Paul Sartre's famous philosophical one-act play No Exit will premiere on the small stage on 11 January next year in a new translation by Eva Mahkovic and directed by Jaša Koceli, who said he will use three actors of different generations.

Crime on Goat Island by Italian playwright Ugo Betti, a 1946 play that deals with manipulation, will be staged on 29 March, directed by Alen Jelen, while the season will be closed by the crime play Run, Maša, Run directed by Nina Šorak.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment', 'lifestyle and leisure']"
Issue raised about declining interest in Slovenian language abroad,"As representatives of Slovenians in Slovenia's neighbouring countries are worried about the shortage of Slovenian teachers and declining interest to learn the language, the relevant parliamentary committee has decided to recommend to the government to improve its support for the promotion of the Slovenian language and identity.","Ksenija Dobrila of the Slovenian Cultural and Economic Association (SKGZ), one of the two umbrella organisations of Slovenians in Italy, told the Commission for Slovenians Abroad that the number of Slovenians in Italy was declining.

She noted as a huge issue the shortage of the teaching staff and added that children were in contact with Slovenian mainly in organised environments, such as school or sporting and social events, but not also at home.

The head of the Union of Slovenian Associations in Croatia, Barbara Riman, also noted the shortage of teachers. The community has been striving since 2008 for the Slovenian language to be used in at least one kindergarten in Croatia, she said.

She thinks that one of the ways to preserve the Slovenian language in Croatia is to restore public transportation between the two countries.

Andrea Kovač, the head of the Union of Slovenians in Hungary, said that there were three bilingual kindergartens and two bilingual schools in the region of Porabje and that it would be a huge step if a teacher was hired in Szentgotthárd.

While there are around 3,000 Slovenians in the Graz area in Austria, only 24 children attend Slovenian classes there, said Susanne Weitlaner, the head of the advisory council for the Slovenian minority at the office of the Austrian chancellor.

She also noted that interest in Slovenian was also declining as part of the Slovenian studies course at the local university.

On the other hand, Mariana Poznič of the United Slovenia association from Buenos Aires said that a Saturday school of Slovenian had been in operation for more than 70 years, with thousands of children passing through it.

There are currently six Saturday schools of Slovenian in Argentina, attended by around 250 children. They are free of charge and the ""interest is growing because new generations are starting to get aware of their Slovenian identity,"" Poznič said.

Vesna Humar, a state secretary at the Office for Slovenians Abroad, said that teaching the Slovenian language abroad ""means entering the education systems of other countries, which means that good solutions require a lot of patience and dialogue.""

She said that the state should pay more attention to activities regarding the Slovenian language abroad, such as sports, through which children learn Slovenian indirectly.

Roman Gruden of the Ministry of Education said that work with teachers was key, while noting that there were 43 teachers of the Slovenian language and culture as part of additional classes abroad, of which 14 teachers had been posted from Slovenia.

Commission member Sara Žibrat of the ruling Freedom Movement agreed that extracurricular activities were important for the greater use of Slovenian, while also noting the importance of motivation, such as job opportunities in Slovenia.

The commission recommended to the government to support as a priority and increase funding for activities and projects to preserve and improve the use of Slovenian in people's homes and projects that involve inter-generational transfer of knowledge.

The government was also urged to promote systemic scholarships for learning of Slovenian and for education in Slovenia, and to establish a task force that would examine the possibilities for new courses of Slovenian to be opened around the world.

The commission would also like to see measures for improved teaching of Slovenian as a second and third language, and better relations with Austria in order to ensure consistent implementation of the minority education law for the state of Carinthia.",education,"['education', 'politics']"
Golob praises intelligence agency as SOVA turns 30,"PM Robert Golob issued a message on Tuesday to mark Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA) Day and the 30th anniversary of SOVA's establishment. He said the situation in Europe has changed with Russia's attack of Ukraine, which puts at stake not only the post-war order but also our values.","Looking at SOVA's beginnings, Golob said the agency was founded when the war was still raging in the area of former Yugoslavia and when the EU treaty was signed in Maastricht, while NATO launched the Partnership for Peace programme a year later.

SOVA was thus established when ""the foundations of the European security architecture were being laid"". And while they were to ensure long-term peace, the situation changed when Russia put an end to confidence- and security-building measures and arms control mechanisms in Europe with its invasion of Ukraine last year.

""Our continent is faced with the worst conflict since the Second World War, which has also led to the biggest refugee crisis since 1945,"" Golob said in the message, posted on the government's website.

This makes ever more critical the role of SOVA, which has over the past 30 years become a key pillar of the national security system which protects citizens, Slovenia's sovereignty and the Slovenian way of life.

Golob is convinced that SOVA has always kept up with the times, which it has also managed to do due to its cooperation with foreign partners and the excellent relations with allied agencies.

SOVA actively monitors the movement of sensitive goods, is involved in monitoring migration flows and has become an important player in ensuring the country's information security, he added.

And more than before, it is involved in counter-intelligence, but Golob said many could not imagine the country would witness the ""phenomena for which we only recently thought were part of fiction and film"", likely a reference to the arrest of two alleged Russian spies in Ljubljana.

Golob announced that the government will make efforts to ensure adequate financial support, improved legislation and the necessary infrastructure for SOVA to operate successfully.

He is confident that SOVA will remain a strong pillar of national security in the future, and congratulated its members on the jubilee, thanking them for their work.

""I want you to know that your contribution to the security of our homeland is recognised and appreciated. Just as the agency counts on you, Slovenia counts on the agency,"" wrote Golob.

He urged SOVA to be just like its symbol, the owl - ""confidently restrained, yet alert and always ready"".","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"
Petrol to digitise supply logistics,"Energy company Petrol plans to completely automate and digitise the process oil derivatives' logistics, including improving utilisation of fuel tankers and providing delivery times to customers. The EUR 7.4 million project for will be finalised by March 2024.","The project Digitalisation of supply chain Oil&Gas E2E, a collaboration with IT companies SmartCargo and Špica International, was successful in an open call launched by the Digital Transformation Ministry. The EU's recovery and resilience fund will contribute some EUR 1.4 million of the total.

The project aims to digitise and upgrade the basic processes of the company from the purchase of petroleum products to sales, said Petrol at Friday's presentation.

Special focus will be placed on efficient and digitalised logistics with the goal of complete control over Petrol's fleet and using as few vehicles as possible.

The project will entail complete automation, integration and digitalisation of processes of purchasing, logistics and sales, said Andrej Kovačič from Petrol.

SmartCargo will develop an advanced logistics platform for energy supply chain optimisation and automation.

Špica will develop a mobile app that will track deliveries to customers or retailers and connect vehicles to headquarters. This will enable Petrol to see when heating oil was delivered, in what state, and how full the tanker was.

The system will be able to suggest alternative routes in case of traffic jams. Respecting the agreed-upon delivery times and offering more flexible times will lead to a better consumer experience, the company says.

The complex supply chain has always presented a challenge for Petrol, said board member Jože Bajuk, adding that the company has invested a lot of energy and money in the past to modernise the system and that new possibilities are opening with the development of new technologies.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'economy, business and finance']"
Constitutional Court annuls act providing recourse for bailed-in bank investors (adds),"After staying it in 2020, the Constitutional Court has now annulled a law that would require the Slovenian central bank to cover all repayments to those who lost their investments during the banking sector bailout of 2013. The top court argued that tasking Banka Slovenije with paying lump-sum damages is at odds with the constitution.","The top court, which had ruled in 2016 that recourse needed to be provided for roughly 100,000 potential plaintiffs, both shareholders and holders of junior bonds, who were wiped out on instruction from the EU, decided on 16 February that the solutions provided in a 2019 law addressing this were unacceptable.

Having stayed the law in March 2020 after a challenge by Banka Slovenije, the top court now said that not all of the law's provisions were unconstitutional, but ""what counted is that a different ruling would have resulted in a splitting of the economic and legal liability for compensation to former holders into two separate entities, which cannot be assumed to be consistent with the legislator's intention"".

The finding highlighted by the Constitutional Court is that the law's Article 40, which stipulates lump-sump compensation and damage payments by the central bank, violated the constitutional principle of its independence as interpreted by EU law. Considering this provision as the core of the law that gives meaning to all the remaining provisions, the court decided to annul the act as a whole.

Echoing the central bank's argument that ordering it to tap into reserves and potentially rely on unconstitutional funding or loans from the state, the Constitutional Court said that Banka Slovenije would have potentially been subject to political pressure in exchange for funds needed for effective operations as well as for something that is not part of its obligations.

""Lump-sum damage payments are essentially a social corrective or a social policy instrument of the state, which should not be financed by the central bank,"" the Constitutional Court wrote about the payments that most estimates suggested could have approached a billion euro.

The top court, which had also turned in January 2021 to the Court of Justice of the European Union for the clarification of several issues, meanwhile rejected Banka Slovenije's argument that provisions on the publication of documents and access to data in the virtual reading room violated the constitutional right to business secrecy as interpreted in accordance with EU law.

A view against central bank financing of such compensation payments was also taken in a preliminary opinion issued in early 2022 by EU court Advocate General Juliane Kokott, who said this would mean running afoul of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The treaty must be interpreted ""as precluding national legislation under which [a central bank], as the resolution authority, must pay compensation to the investors of a credit institution whose capital instruments have been written down or cancelled as a result of a reorganisation or resolution measure ordered by it,"" says opinion of Kokott.

Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court moreover stressed in its ruling that the issue of a lack of effective legal recourse for the affected investors remained an unconstitutional void in the legal system, one ""that has been there for an unacceptable amount of time"".

As has also been noted by the European Court of Human Rights, a solution must be found as soon as possible, the court said, while stressing that the case should not become time-barred.

""It is difficult to conceive a constitutionally consistent legal regime that would place the economic burden for errors in the deletion of eligible liabilities on any entity other than the state as the guardian of the public interest in the pursuit of which the deletion was made,"" the court wrote.

A call for a prompt solution coming from the government and parliament also came from the Association of Small Shareholders, which said that the banks that have been bailed out are still in business and that a subordinated bond constitutes a loan that has not been repaid for nine years and 3.5 months.

A proposal for a solution was announced in a response by Banka Slovenije, which said the top court had validated its arguments. The central bank said the proposal, drawn up at its behest by a group of experts, would be presented to the public in the coming days.

The Finance Ministry said it had already started its own search for a solution while the court had still been deliberating. It highlighted the importance of the court okaying provisions allowing the disclosure of certain data, ""in particular information on the results of the stress tests and the bank asset quality review"".","economy, business and finance","['crime, law and justice', 'politics', 'economy, business and finance']"
Police investigating UKC Ljubljana employee over alleged violence against patient,"Police are investigating a report of violence against a patient at an intensive care unit of the neurology clinic of the UKC Ljubljana hospital. A nurse reportedly hit a patient on the head and threaten him, web portal N1 reported on Friday.","The incident reportedly happened on 20 August, as a patient in intensive care would not cooperate in a care procedure. The nurse was allegedly so angered by this that he hit the patient on the head and mouth twice and told him he would kill him if he did not stop shouting.

The patient shared his story with several members of the staff. Subsequently, the nurse was removed from the intensive care unit, but according to N1 he was back at work in a few days although the patient in question was still there.

UKC director general Marko Jug asserted today that the employee had been in contact with the patient only on 20 August and was on sick leave the following week. When the employee returned to work, he was working in a different part of the clinic. The employee was also under constant supervision, Jug said.

The incident was immediately reported to the police and a hospital inquiry would be introduced if necessary, UKC said.

A procedure was also launched for staff training on prevention of violent communication, which is organised regularly at other UKC clinics.

If the accusations against the employee are confirmed during the investigation, he will most likely be fired, Jug said.

UKC also noted that the long-term member of staff at the neurology clinic has never been involved in any incidents of violence before. ""We have not had a similar incident at the neurology clinic, but there have been several incidents of patients being violent towards staff,"" the clinic said, adding that the safety of patients was a priority so there is zero tolerance towards violence.

Prime Minister Robert Golob responded to the incident on X, saying that he had demanded explanations about the incident. He also called for non-violence, tolerance and solidarity.

The report of the incident comes after Slovenia was shocked earlier this week by the news of a student working at a care home in Trebnje who harassed the elderly and posted videos of this on TikTok.",health,"['crime, law and justice', 'health']"
Delo finds health minister's resignation belated,"The newspaper Delo suggests in Saturday's commentary that Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan should have been dismissed half a year ago, but Prime Minister Robert Golob had been playing for time because of the minister's popularity.","The paper notes that a number of experts had left the ministry because of Bešič Loredan, including those he brought along, citing rumours that he is difficult to work with and that he would not listen.

One of the minister's aides found ""refuge"" with the prime minister, which means Golob must have known back then things were amiss, but still he had been publicly protesting his trust in the minister until yesterday.

Still, in actions, such as his taking the body advising on health reform under his wing, Golob showed his distinct distrust of the minister, reads the commentary End of Ignorance Pretending over Health Minister.

""Golob's tactical stalling was certainly partly due to Bešič Loredan's popularity in opinion polls, where he trailed behind the minister.""

Surgeon Erik Brecelj, the chair of the government's strategic council for healthcare, has been an outspoken critic of the minister and he informed the PM a while ago that him and Bešič Loredan were not on speaking terms and that it was impossible to work that way, a position that Golob understood.

""Now he has taken action at last, making a move that he should have made about six months ago, when he was informed in detail about the wrong direction decisions were taking into privatisation, sources say.

""Golob has promised to take the planned reform forward, but the question is how and with whom. Who will dare step into the hot coals and take responsibility for the nation's health as the 18th in line,"" the paper wonders in reference to the long line of ministers that have taken turn at the health department.",health,['politics']
Global football event raises EUR 3.5m for flood victims,"Over EUR 3.5 million was raised for flood victims during a charity football game featuring a number of legendary names at the sold-out Ljubljana Stožice stadium last night. The match was won 5:4 in overtime by the blue team, featuring Zlatan Ibrahimović, Gianluigi Buffon and Miroslav Klose, among others.","""I would like to thank all those who have helped, all who bought a ticker, all who donated, and above all our friends on the pitch,"" Aleksander Čeferin, the president of Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), who initiated the idea, said before the match.

Some 16,000 spectators enjoyed the spectacle live at the stadium, but it was also broadcast in more than 100 countries around the globe, the organisers said. During half time, the event was addressed by the legendary Brazilian player Ronaldo in a video message.

The blue team was headed by Matjaž Kek, the head coach of the Slovenian national team. It included Buffon, Paolo Maldini, Eric Abidal, Vedran Ćorluka, Ibrahimović, Javier Zanetti, Davor Šuker, Zvonimir Boban, Clarence Seedorf, Miran Pavlin, Predrag Mijatović, Klose, Dimitar Berbatov, Boštjan Cesar, Levan Kobiašvili, Milivoje Novaković and Marcos Tavares.

The red team was headed by the legendary Italian coach Fabio Capello and it included David James, Dario Srna, Nemanja Vidić, Mikael Silvestre, Branko Ilić, Aljoša Asanović, Robert Pires, Luis Figo, Oliver Bierhoff, Andrej Ševčenko, Milenko Aćimović, Hamit Altintop, Mišo Brečko, Bojan Jokić, Robert Koren, Dejan Savičević, Mario Mandžukić, Giorgios Karagunis and Ivica Olić.

The players entered the pitch in the company of children from the Mengeš kindergarten who had to be evacuated as the floods hit on 4 August, the photos of the rescue efforts shaking the country. Moreover, some 1,600 members of the civil protection services, firefighters and soldiers were among the spectators.

Kek expressed gratitude after the game. ""A big thank you to all; for the idea, to the organisers, the fantastic spectators, everybody, including the global football stars for making their mark and helping to raise much-needed funds.""

Kek was honoured to lead a team of legendary footballers. ""A great privilege and a lot of respect. But, you saw it for yourself: some a bit on the heavy side, some with thinner hair, but all showed the will and this is yet another proof that they will always be masters of football.""",sport,"['sport', 'disaster and accident']"
Parties support heath digitalisation bill despite delay,"A day after withdrawing a bill considered a cornerstone of the planned healthcare reform from the agenda of this week's National Assembly session, coalition partners and the opposition New Slovenia (NSi), expressed support on Tuesday for the healthcare digitalisation bill in the wake of the resignation of Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan.","MPs of the Freedom Movement, the Social Democrats (SD) and the Left withdrew the bill from the agenda of an extraordinary session scheduled to start on Thursday. This will be the last session before the summer recess.

The coalition MPs said there was not enough time to study 49 pages of remarks to the bill by the parliament's legal services, and draft the needed amendments by Wednesday, when the bill was to be discussed by the parliamentary Health Committee ahead of the plenary.

Last week, the Information Commissioner questioned the constitutionality of the bill and two days later, the legal services issued its own remarks, listing a number of shortcomings, mostly regarding clarity and goals of provisions on data processing.

The same day Bešič Loredan offered his resignation due to what Prime Minister Robert Golob said were conceptual differences regarding the development of the healthcare system. Golob is to step in as health minister after Bešič Loredan is formally dismissed at the upcoming plenary.

Borut Sajovic, the head of the Freedom Movement's deputy group, said the delay does not mean the coalition was not working on solutions. He added that the bill had been passed at first reading without a single nay.

This indicates a strong awareness that Slovenia needs this bill, he said. ""The public debate provided a number of remarks, considerations and proposals to improve it. We are taking these seriously.""

Matej T. Vatovec, the head of the Left's deputy group, said that the minister's resignation meant ""the man who carries this vision is gone"". Nevertheless, the smallest coalition partner believes the bill is good enough to go through parliament.

Vatovec said that things will likely depend on the way Bešič Loredan's successor will approach the planned health reform. ""From this vantage point, it is perhaps sensible to wait. The month we will lose to the summer break will not jeopardise the process.""

The SD said that the bill is desperately needed, above all to provide good and prompt system oversight. This bill is the first step of the reform and must be carefully completed. The bill regulates a very sensitive field and quality comes before speed.

When the government sent the bill to parliament without having perfected it first, the National Assembly took on the responsibility to improve it, said the SD.

The biggest opposition party, the Democrats, was unavailable for comment today, but NSi expressed support for the bill.

While deputy group head Janez Cigler Kralj questioned the decision to withdraw the bill from the National Assembly's agenda, MP Jernej Vrtovec did not see a problem in this move.

Instead, he expressed scepticism over the ability to amend the bill without a health minister. Vrtovec also said that Slovenia was often trying to be too principled when it comes to data processing legislation.",health,"['politics', 'health']"
State secretary visiting Slovenians in South America,"State Secretary at the Government Office for Slovenes Abroad Vesna Humar is visiting Slovenians living in Brazil and Argentina. On Saturday, she met the Slovenian community in Sao Paolo, where she opened the community's first centre, and discussed business cooperation with the Slovenian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce.","The opening of the Triglav Slovenian Hall is a milestone for the Slovenian community in Brazil, because the Association of Slovenians in Brazil did not have its own premises until now, the Office for Slovenians Abroad said in Saturday's press release.

Humar opened it together with Martin Črnugelj, who served as the association's president for years, and with his successor Boris Krajnc Alves.

The community thanked the state secretary for the financial contribution the Office for Slovenians Abroad provided for the new hall.

The opening event attracted almost 120 Slovenians from around Brazil, who meet in-person once a year for St Martin's Day festivities, while often meeting online.

The association pays a lot of attention to the preservation of archival material about the community and its members, while it marks annually Slovenian Statehood Day and organises St Nicholas festivities for children.

Business cooperation and related challenges were in the focus of Humar's meeting with members of the Slovenian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce, which was founded in 2016.

Its president Matjaž Cokan outlined a project of interactive map and virtual catalogue of Slovenian products and services in Brazil, which they would like to expand to the US, Canada and Argentina.

Humar hailed a memorandum of understanding signed by the Slovenian chambers in Brazil and Argentina as a good example of connecting Slovenians around the world.

There is an estimated 5,000 Slovenians in Brazil. While they are dispersed around the country, the majority live in the federal state of Sao Paulo, while there are large communities in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.

On Friday, State Secretary Humar met Slovenian Honorary Consul in Sao Paulo Octavio Tavares de Oliva Filho and ex-Honorary Consul Štefan Bogdan Barenboim Šalej and his spouse Débora Barenboim-Šalej, Brazil's former ambassador to Slovenia.

Protestant to represent religious communities on new RTV council,"President Nataša Pirc Musar has nominated Klaudija Sedar, a 42-year-old representative of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, as a member of the new governing council at RTV Slovenija to represent the religious communities in the country.","Pirc Musar selected the representative of religious communities in line with the changes to the public broadcaster act endorsed in a November 2022 referendum and based on a public call to registered religious communities to propose their candidates.

The new council will have 17 members, down 12 from the previous programme council, and its appointment procedure has also been changed to exclude parliament from it.

Eleven members will represent various publics, including the registered religious communities, while RTV staff will select their six members among themselves.

Sedar holds a PhD in intercultural studies and currently heads Zavod Primoža Trubarja, a research and cultural institution set up by the Evangelical Church, Pirc Musar's office said.

Sedar has also published several books and edited a number of Evangelical publications, including the monthly Evangeličanski List.

The president is convinced that given her know-how, reputation and achievements in culture and education, Sedar will contribute to RTV's good functioning and reputation.

Sedar's term on the RTV council is four years, which is in line with a draw the president's office organised in January to set the terms of the RTV councillors she nominates.

Several dozen religious communities are registered in Slovenia, with the Roman Catholic Church being by far the largest.

According to the 2002 census, the last where citizens had to state their religion, almost 57.8% of Slovenians declared themselves as Roman Catholics, 2.4% as Muslims, 2.3% as Orthodox and 0.8% as Evangelical-Lutheran.",religion and belief,"['religion and belief', 'social issue']"

And the fact that the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy is declining, mostly due to high electricity prices, does not bode well either.

Even if Slovenia experiences only a mild recession, this could further undermine consumer and business confidence and create conditions for a deeper and longer decline in economic activity.

Delo calls for unity and solidarity with Ukraine on Europe Day,"As Europe Day is marked on Tuesday coinciding with the end of WWII on the continent, the newspaper Delo cites Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the headline of its commentary reading Return of Evil.

And today the Ukrainian nation is fighting for the same peace again.

On this landmark day for Europe, Zelensky said that ""unfortunately, evil has returned. Although the aggressor is different now, they have the same goal - enslavement or destruction.""

Zelensky also declared that Ukraine will celebrate 9 May as Europe Day to honour the unity of all Europeans who defeated Nazism and will overcome 'ruscism'.

""The war in Ukraine is a tragic reminder of the fragility of peace and freedom that most of Europe has enjoyed for nearly eight decades. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's words that it is necessary to fight for a democratic law-governed state every day ... should be taken as a serious warning and a call to us all.

""It is a historical coincidence that the colours of the Ukrainian flag are very similar to the colours of the European Union flag ...

Slovenian rescue team returning from Turkey,"A Slovenian team of rescue dogs and their handlers that was sent to Turkey to help locate earthquake survivors is returning to Slovenia on Saturday, the Defence Ministry said.","The team of seven rescue dogs, their handlers and four assistants was deployed to Turkey on Tuesday, under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, in the wake of one of the deadliest earthquakes in decades that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday.

The team joined the rescue effort on the ground on Wednesday to comb through the rubble in search of life.

It will return home today in cooperation with the Slovenian army.

Blaž Turk, the head of the team, said that the work had been very demanding. The team was highly motivated throughout their time in Turkey and even the dogs' injuries did not dampen their motivation, he said as quoted by the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.

The administration said that one of the seven dogs had not been able to take part in the rescue effort yesterday, adding that the dog's wound had been treated.

It also posted a video on Twitter in which one of the handlers said there was confusion as to which facilities had already been checked by dogs, so they were in contact with local representatives to make sure they were searching for signs of life in the right places.

The debris makes it very difficult to drive on the roads, which are impassable, so even a short journey in the same street can take half an hour, he said, adding that they would soon hit the 100th hour of the effort, meaning that time was slowly running out for rescuers.

He said there was still hope of finding survivors, ""but there is more and more of the smell of dead bodies buried in the rubble, which is quite stressful for us as well as the dogs.""

Earlier this week, the administration said they were expected to stay in Turkey for four or five days, as exhaustion usually set in after such a period.

Many international search teams are gradually withdrawing from the affected areas due to the deteriorating security situation, injuries and exhaustion, the ministry said in a press release.

A number of Slovenian relief and charity organisations, including Unicef Slovenia, the Slovenian Red Cross and Caritas, have launched donation campaigns to help people in the affected areas in Turkey and Syria. They opened dedicated accounts and donations are also possible via text messages.

Caritas Slovenia has so far raised more than EUR 120,000, the organisation said today as it called for additional support.

More than 24,000 people have been confirmed dead so far in the wake of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks that struck Turkey and Syria, and the death toll keeps rising.",disaster and accident,['disaster and accident']
NGO reported to police over referendum campaign funding from abroad,"The youth wing of the opposition Democrats (SDS) has reported the 8 March Institute to the police and the Court of Audit for having financed its referendum campaign against a waters bill with funds from abroad. The NGO has responded by saying it did get EUR 30,000 from a German foundation, but almost a year after the 2021 referendum.","Under Slovenian law, organisers of election and referendum campaigns cannot use funds obtained from foreign legal or physical persons to finance such campaigns.

The 8 March Institute campaigned heavily against the changes to the waters act, which were passed under the previous, SDS-led government but defeated in the July 2021 referendum.

Speaking to the press on Thursday, the Slovenian Democratic Youth (SDM) said that the NGO as an organiser of the referendum campaign had violated the law.

The SDM's vice president Nejc Brence said that the 8 March Institute had received EUR 30,000 from Guerrila Foundation and transferred it to its referendum campaign account.

He labelled the Berlin-based foundation as an ""organisation which encourages with its funds radical leftist activists"".

Nika Kovač, director of the 8 March Institute, rejected the allegations, saying they had received the funds but only in April 2022, almost a year after the referendum.

""The referendum campaign for clear drinking water was largely financed by the NGO Ekokrog, which raised donations from people, while the Institute spent only around EUR 3,000 on the entire referendum campaign,"" she told the STA and TV Slovenija.

She accused the SDM of an attempt to silence them, but stressed they ""won't silenced, it's just that our lawyers will have a bit more work to do, because we are already checking whether we can take the SDM to court for lies"".

The NGO is ready to give all the documents about the referendum campaign funding and the funds obtained from Guerilla Foundation to relevant authorities.

The SDM meanwhile expects the case to be thoroughly investigated, ""at least to the extent the SDS was investigated in all election campaigns - for every cent, for every step, the way it should be"", said Brence.",politics,"['crime, law and justice', 'politics', 'social issue']"
PM announces swifter aid for storm damage,"Prime Minister Robert Golob announced on Monday amendments to the Natural Disaster Recovery Act that will speed up the payment of financial assistance for storm-related damage. Based on a preliminary recovery plan, municipalities would be entitled to an upfront payment of 20%.","The government is expected to adopt the legislative changes at the first scheduled session after the summer recess, Golob told a press conference after a meeting with officials in charge of storm recovery and clean-up efforts.

Last week, government efforts were stepped up to finalise the amendments as soon as possible due to a recent wave of devastating storms and alarming forecasts.

The prime minister's announcement comes just after the Environment Agency issued an orange alert for the northern parts of Slovenia for Monday and for the entire country on Tuesday. The storms that are about to hit the country are forecast to be of similar intensity as those in the past week.

""The aim is that, once these legislative changes are passed, those entitled to the aid will be able to get part of their emergency measures funding paid out already this year,"" Golob said.

He listed the preliminary recovery plan and the partial cost estimate for the emergency measures as essential measures. Under the plan, municipalities will be entitled to a 20% upfront payment for such measures, while the partial cost estimate will allow action to be taken before a full damage assessment has been done.

The adoption of the legislative changes and damage assessment will go hand in hand, so no time will be lost, he added.

So far, procedures to pay out assistance for storm damage have been often very time-consuming, Golob said, and the aim is to make sure those whose entire harvest has been destroyed will get their aid much sooner. In the case of those affected by recent storms this will mean as soon as this year.

Weather protection and insurance are still very important, he said, noting that the legislation allows for de minimis compensation in the event of a 100% loss of crops. This now also applies to hail damage, he added.

The Association of Municipalities has proposed a solution under which a part of funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan would be redirected to help strengthen civil protection and firefighting efforts.

Golob said the idea had not been not discussed today since the solution was such that it did not enable swift action.

Civil Protection commander Srečko Šestan believes the planned amendments will make a difference.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'politics']"
EU activates Copernicus to help Slovenia monitor floods,"The EU's Copernicus Emergency Management Service has been activated upon the request of Slovenian authorities to assist them in responding to the ongoing severe floods and landslides in the country, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said on Friday.","The Copernicus monitoring system has been activated at the request of the Slovenian Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, the EU commissioner from Slovenia said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The satellite-supported monitoring of the situation will help disaster relief and other authorities in responding to severe flash floods that have affected most parts of the country.

Earlier Lenarčič said the EU Civil Protection Mechanism was ready to be activated if Slovenia asked for assistance.

In situations where the scale of an emergency situation exceeds a country's capacity to respond on its own, the country can request assistance through the EU's mechanism, which in effect means assistance from other EU countries and states participating in the mechanism.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'politics']"
"Central bank upgrades GDP forecast for 2023, downgrades 2024 and 2025 projection (adds)","Slovenia's central bank has upgraded the GDP growth forecast for this year by 1.2 percentage points to 2%, but it downgraded its prediction slightly for 2024 and 2025, to 2.2%.","""After brisk economic growth last year we expect moderate growth in the forecast period,"" vice-governor Tina Žumer told the press on Friday.

The projected growth rate for this year is more than double the eurozone average, while the forecast for 2024 and 2025 exceeds the latest forecasts for the eurozone by roughly half a percentage point.

""The relatively modest growth [for this year] is mostly the consequence of low growth at the beginning of the year, but as the year goes on we expect it to accelerate as inflation calms down and supply chains stabilise,"" Žumer said.

Growth will continue to be underpinned by domestic consumption, both private spending and investments.

In 2025, however, investments are projected to taper off as the existing EU financing period.

The projections are also based on ""tighter financing conditions, which will limit the growth of private investments,"" said Arjana Brezigar Masten, the head of the central bank's analytical department.

With employment remaining high and unemployment at record lows, the tight job market is projected to exert upward pressure on wage growth.

At the start of the year wage growth reached the highest rate in 20 years. By the end of the year, wages are projected to grow by nearly a tenth on the year before.

In the following two years wage growth will slow, but it will still outpace price growth by several percentage points, the central bank predicts.

This will fuel domestic inflation, both because of higher costs and more robust demand, according to her.

The central bank projects inflation to reach 7.5%, about a percentage point lower than it is now, before dropping to 3.6% in 2024 and 2.6% in 2025.

Inflation and geopolitical circumstances represent the main risk factor in the forecast.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'labour']"
Dewesoft unveils new development facility,"The high-tech manufacturer Dewesoft inaugurated on Friday a new development facility at its headquarters in Trbovlje, eastern Slovenia. The EUR 5 million investment has been fully financed by the company.","The new facility comprises two floors, each floor covering 400 square metres. The construction of the highly energy-efficient building with smart plumbing, which started a year ago, used 100 tonnes of steel.

""When a company is listed or ends up owned by a financial fund, it often loses passion and momentum. As soon as short-term profit becomes more important than long-term development, the company meets its demise,"" said the company's co-founder Jure Knez.

""We want to run Dewesoft differently, so we are constantly pushing the boundaries both in the development of measurement technology and in the co-ownership model,"" he told the inauguration ceremony.

Knez believes that this is the best foundation for many other Slovenian companies as well, since companies need stability. Local or family capital is much more patient than foreign owners' capital, he said, adding that this was the best recipe for making sure Dewesoft remained a healthy Slovenian company 100 years from now.

Higher Education Minister Igor Papič sees Dewesoft as a global company that helps set up new companies. He pointed to the Research and Innovation Agency's innovation pillar aimed at business development and improvement of knowledge transfer from academia to industry.

Next year, EUR 500 million will be available for investments in research for researchers and companies active outside the higher education sector, he added.

In the first half of 2023, Dewesoft, a maker of data acquisition systems, generated EUR 30 million in sales revenue, up 62% year-on-year, and its net profit increased by 66% to EUR 9.3 million. Some 85% of profit the company invests in development and infrastructure.",science and technology,['science and technology']
Treasury: Pay rise deals not jeopardising fiscal stability,"After a number economists have raised concerns about pay rise deals that the government has agreed with various groups of public sector employees, the Finance Ministry said the financial impact of the deals agreed this week was within the EUR 611 million pay deal agreed with public sector trade unions in October last year.","The financial effect of the EUR 600 gross in monthly bonus promised to judges and prosecutors is estimated at EUR 9.1 million annually, the ministry said on Thursday in response to the STA's questions.

The ministry described the bonus as a temporary measure, to be in force until the public sector pay system has been reformed. The funds will be secured through budget redistribution, it said.

The impact of the planned increase in salaries of kindergarten assistant teachers by four brackets and a pay rise for junior researchers is EUR 18 million in 2023, according to the ministry.

The ministry said the deal with the doctors' union Fides would have not financial consequences. Doctors' demands are to be resolved in a separate pay tier for healthcare which is to come into effect by next year.

""We would like to emphasise that the changes adopted do not jeopardise the sustainability of public finances,"" the ministry said.

Among those raising concerns about the latest pay rise deals was Davorin Kračun, the head of the Fiscal Council, who told the commercial broadcaster POP TV the public sector wage bill was EUR 5.5 billion or 11% of GDP.

""This means that each percentage of the rise in those wages accounts for EUR 50 million in additional borrowing,"" Kračun said.

""We're talking about irresponsible distribution of money that is in fact non-existing,"" Maks Tajnikar, the dean of the Ljubljana School of Business and Economics, told the newspaper Delo.","economy, business and finance","['labour', 'crime, law and justice', 'economy, business and finance', 'politics', 'social issue']"
Public presentation to be held on qualified majority in EU,The Foreign Policy Committee on Wednesday endorsed an initiative to hold a public presentation of opinions on changes to qualified majority voting in the EU after Slovenia joined a group of countries calling for a reform of this voting system.,"The initiative was put forward by committee chair Predrag Baković in an effort to involve the parliamentary working body more closely in the debate. Experts and other stakeholders will be invited, the debate will take place in autumn.

Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon welcomed the initiative saying Slovenia needed ""a thorough debate on what is going on concerning voting in EU foreign and security policies.""

The most important thing for Slovenia is EU unity and the need to have the voice of small member states heard, she said.

Slovenia recently joined the German-led initiative, with the caveat that for now it is merely keeping an eye on the developments.

The stance has been heavily criticised by opposition leader Janez Janša, who said a reform of the system would be damaging for small member states.

Fajon noted today that talks in the informal group were under way and one of the reasons Slovenia is taking part was ""to protect our own interests"".",politics,"['politics', 'human interest']"

Winter Festival of classical music starting,"The 6th iteration of the Winter Festival of classical music, held as part of the Ljubljana Festival, will be ushered in this evening at the Cankarjev Dom arts centre by tenor Rolando Villazon accompanied by the RTV Slovenija Symphony Orchestra led by Alfonso Scarano. This year the festival is combined with an international piano competition.","According to the organisers, Villazon's unique performances with leading international opera ensembles and orchestras have established him as one of the world's leading stars. He is one of the most versatile artists in the world, with a successful career as a theatre director, novelist and television personality in addition to his activities on stage.

In Ljubljana, he will interpret the music of Mozart, Verdi, Donizetti and other composers, accompanied by the Radio Symphony Orchestra led by Alfonso Scarano, who is the chief conductor of the Thai Philharmonic Orchestra.

The festival's second concert will be performed on 1 March by the Slovenian Youth Orchestra under the direction of Živa Ploj Peršuh. The orchestra, which has also welcomed some of the Ukrainian musicians now living in Ljubljana, will be joined by violinist Robert Lakatoš and clarinettist Arthur Stockel. The setlist includes Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in A major and Brahms's Violin Concerto in D major, as well as Brahms's Hungarian Dances.

The third concert, held a day later, will feature Hector Berlioz's magnificent Requiem performed by an expanded Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra and four choirs under the baton of conductor Charles Dutoit. The soloist will be Ljubljana Opera's tenor Branko Robinšak.

The festival will conclude this year with the final two nights of the first iteration of the Ljubljana International Piano Competition. On 3 and 4 March, six young pianists will showcase their musicality at Cankarjev Dom, performing a piano concerto of their choice with the RTV Slovenija Symphony Orchestra led by Ricardo Castro.

The performances of the competitors will be judged by a nine-member jury chaired by internationally renowned pianist Dubravka Tomšič Srebotnjak.

Večer urges unity for food self-sufficiency,"The storms that hit the country this summer culminating with the early August floods have not only washed away material goods but also indifference in which people lived, thinking that they would always be able to avoid the worst, Večer says in Tuesday's commentary. Agriculture has been affected as well, including its ability to grow food.","The newspaper praises President Nataša Pirc Musar for her recent statement at the AGRA fair that agriculture is not blocking change, it is a key player in the progress and prosperity of society.

Agriculture trade unionist Anton Medved added that how much food Slovenians produce ourselves will determine whether Slovenia will be a sovereign country.

Večer says this is about the question of true sovereignty which means that as a country Slovenia is able to provide for itself in times of need without depending on others.

""That is why a strong national food supply chain must be in place, even in times when there are no major threats,"" it says in Indifference Washed Away.

It says there have been enough warnings, starting with the Covid epidemic when supply chains were interrupted, then came the war in Ukraine when the energy crisis broke out, and ""the floods have come as the third major warning that the future will be full of uncertain situations and that it is better to be well prepared in all areas"".

"Details set on temporary checks at borders crossings with Croatia, Hungary","Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar signed on Friday an order determining the border crossings with Croatia and Hungary at which crossing will be permitted during the temporary border control Slovenia is introducing on Saturday. Only 14 crossings will be available to everyone who meet the conditions, regardless of citizenship.","The order comes as Slovenia is introducing control on the border with Croatia and Hungary until 30 October, with the possibility of extension.

Explaining the decision, of which the European Commission has already been notified, the government cited heightened security risks due to organised crime and the escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

Everyone who meets the conditions, regardless of their citizenship, will be able to cross into Slovenia at twelve border crossings for international road passenger and cargo traffic on the border with Croatia and two on the border with Hungary.

In addition, Slovenian citizens and other people who have the right to free movement under the EU law will be able to cross into Slovenia at another 18 border crossings with Croatia and Hungary, the Interior Ministry announced.

The ministry noted that those who have the right to free movement under the EU law are citizens of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and their family members, regardless of their citizenship.

These are also third-country nationals and their family members, regardless of their citizenship, who have the right to free movement equivalent to that of EU citizens in accordance with international treaties.

The ministry said it was a ""measure of last resort proportionate to the identified threat,"" adding that it would be implemented in a coordinated manner and in cooperation with the police forces of Italy, Croatia and Hungary.

The border crossings where everyone who meets the conditions, regardless of their citizenship, can cross into Slovenia are the road crossings Sečovlje, Dragonja, Sočerga, Starod, Jelšane, Petrina, Metlika, Obrežje, Dobovec, Gruškovje, Zavrč and Petišovci (Croatia) and Pince (motorway) and Dolga Vas (Hungary).

Govt council on ex-Yugoslav communities discusses potential abolishment of TV show,"The government council for ethnic communities from the former Yugoslavia discussed on Wednesday developments that could lead to a TV show for them being abolished, while also touching on state funds for the ethnic communities and on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the Culture Ministry said in a release.","Public broadcaster TV Slovenija launched the show NaGlas!, aired every other Saturday, eight years ago as the only such show for the Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian communities here.

In March, its editor and presenter Saša Banjanac Lubej said that the TV Slovenija acting director decided not to extend the contacts of the contributing journalists.

She said at the time that this would in effect mean cancelling the show although it is part of the national broadcaster's plan for this year.

The council members expressed concern over the announced termination of cooperation with the show's contributory, who are all members of the ex-Yugoslav communities.

They thus urged keeping the show's quality content, which they believe should not be impacted by the strained situation at public broadcaster RTV Slovenija.

The council will send its position to the government and urge RTV Slovenija to ensure conditions to keep NaGlas! within the current scope in the future.

Today's session was chaired by the council's head, Culture Minister Asta Vrečko, while ethnic Macedonian Ilija Dimitrievski was appointed vice-chair for this year.

The council also discussed the distribution of funds under the public call for cultural projects of ethnic communities and immigrants, which is the main source of the ex-Yugoslav communities' funding.

Vrečko announced that her ministry will provide an additional EUR 150,000 to the country's fund for cultural activities JSKD, to be available in two calls for proposals.

As for the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the council discussed recommendations regarding the council's activities and Slovenia's stance on them. The members agreed to ask the government to study the options for improving their status.

Golob: Protection of civilians more important than ceasefire terminology,"Protecting civilians in the Middle East is more important than how to technically call a ceasefire, PM Robert Golob said as he arrived at the EU summit in Brussels where EU leaders are discussing the crisis in the Middle East. He believes a clear stance must be taken to protect civilians on both sides and to establish humanitarian corridors.","He expects today's discussion to revolve around whether the EU should urge Israel and Hamas to a humanitarian ceasefire.

Given the latest draft conclusions, the leaders are to call for humanitarian breaks to enable delivery of humanitarian aid, rather than for humanitarian ceasefire.

""I think the word as such is less important. What is important is to protect civilians, and we will insist on this. We will insist that a clear position be taken as soon as possible, which is today, that civilians on both sides must be protected, that humanitarian corridors must be established,"" said Golob, adding that key infrastructure, such as hospitals and humanitarian infrastructure, should also be protected.

All sides must be called upon to respect international humanitarian law, he said. ""I think this is a point from which we mustn't detour.""

As for criticism that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not urge respect for international humanitarian law in her first reactions to the crisis, Golob said she will have an opportunity to explain her positions today, and urged the EU's unity.

""Today we're all striving for unity, and I believe that we'll try to maintain this unity, so I would rather look at today than at the past,"" he said, adding the Union should also be united in making efforts for the conflict not to spread through the region.",human interest,"['unrest, conflicts and war', 'human interest', 'politics']"

Balkan religious leaders urge joint efforts to overcome differences,"A two-day meeting of religious leaders from the Balkans started in Koper on Saturday. Addressing the meeting, which is hosted by the Slovenian Catholic Church, President Nataša Pirc Musar called on the religious leaders to help overcome differences in the region. The participants expressed support for the region's EU prospects.","The meeting is hosted by the Slovenian Bishops' Conference (SŠK) in cooperation with the Diocese of Koper.

Launching the Forum for Dialogue and Peace in the Balkans, the main segment of the meeting, SŠK president Andrej Saje said that in addition to the international community the commitment to peace in modern society involved other social entities too, in particular the Christian churches and other religions, as well as individuals.

""We are co-responsible for life on this planet, through small and everyday actions we are fellow workers in building peace,"" he said.

The commitment to peace is possible only through sincere dialogue and the ability to listen, Saje said, urging the forum to be an example of dialogue, listening, accepting differences and cooperation, ""so that we reduce divisions and conflicts and contribute to efforts to build peace and a better world"".

Also addressing the forum, President Pirc Musar said that due to acute political instability in the Western Balkans, crimes that took place in the region, and the rollback of democracy ""we witness everywhere today"", the timing of the meeting could not be more appropriate. The question of how to move forward is more pressing than ever, she added.

She stressed the need to continue with EU accession efforts in the region. ""I would like to see leaders in the region realise that they will be stronger if they are part of European integration, and that sometimes things have to be given up for this.

""Every candidate country, including Slovenia, has been tested in this way. The fact that we had to make certain compromises in moving towards the EU has paid off in many ways. In every respect, Slovenia is infinitely richer today than when it was not a member state,"" she said.

Aware that the region still faces many challenges, the president pointed to divisions and exclusion, including on the grounds of religion. She therefore called on the religious leaders to help overcome divisions in the region.

""If anyone, it is you, who can take a big, even decisive step towards cooperation, mutual understanding, the elimination of divisions and the acceptance of difference [...] You too are called to help the entire region move towards a path of forgiveness, acceptance of diversity, and an inclusive future.""

The forum is also attended by Prime Minister Robert Golob and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, who is taking part in the event as a delegate of Pope Francis.

The Balkan region was once called a powder keg, Parolin said, but at the same time there have been ""many remarkable examples of harmonious coexistence between members of different nationalities, cultures and faiths in the region"".

Nevertheless, challenges remain, including constant efforts to invest in a culture of encounter ""to avoid a culture of confrontation"", he said, highlighting dialogue as an important aspect ""that is essential in the current era of globalisation"".

Parolin also stressed the importance of interfaith dialogue, which Pope Francis also believes is ""an essential prerequisite for peace"". Interfaith dialogue is the duty of all believers and religious leaders, he added.

The Vatican's secretary of state sees efforts to move towards EU membership as one of the solutions to maintain peace in the region, and such efforts are supported by the Holy See.

The meeting in the coastal town of Koper is one of the most important religious events in Slovenia and the wider region this year.

It is attended by the leaders of the Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Muslim and Jewish communities from the region. In their addresses, they all stressed the need and their own responsibility for dialogue and constant active efforts to overcome differences. The challenges are many, but they are not insurmountable, they said.

At the end of the three-hours forum, the participants adopted a special resolution noting that peace is their common goal and calling on all individuals, especially those in positions of leadership, to promote and work for it.

They stress that extremism, terrorism and all other forms of violence and war have nothing to do with genuine religion, and must be rejected both in society as well as at the level of religious communities.

They note the need for regular meetings and efforts to seek joint solutions between the various religious communities in the Balkan region, where, due to their historical and current influence, the Catholic and Orthodox churches and the Islamic community have a particular responsibility.

What will follow in the afternoon is a Youth for Peace cultural meeting, and in the evening a gala organ concert will be held at the Koper cathedral.

Primorske Novice says border controls are turning back the time,"Slovenia is going back 16 years today, the Koper-based newspaper Primorske Novice says on Saturday about the reintroduction of border checks within the Schengen zone. As of today, Schengen, a key project of the EU, is buried, at least temporary, the commentary says under the headline Border Control: Back to the Future.","The escalation of the situation in the Middle East and the weak political will in the EU to reform the Schengen system have come in very handy for a number of countries, including Italy and then Slovenia, in their search for an alibi to reimpose stricter border controls.

""Under the guise of the growing threat of terrorism, they are introducing this more or less because of the increased flow of migrants. There have already been three times as many unauthorised crossings of the border with Croatia this year as last year, and since Italy is one of the final destinations of migrants, this can be seen with the naked eye in the Primorska region.""

The border controls will affect the everyday lives of the people in Primorska the most, where in Nova Gorica and Gorizia, a town located in two different countries, many people have cross-border professional, family and social ties.

The people have not yet forgotten the Covid times, when the borders were closed and people were cut off from their relatives, friends, the regional newspaper says.

The locals who cross the border with Croatia and Italy on a daily basis will get used to the new regime somehow. But the instructions given to police will determine whether there will be a human face at the borders in the days to come, or the settings for a potentially more repressive regime in the future will be discreetly tested.

People at the border rightly expect that the measure, if not already avoided, will indeed be temporary. Not in the Austrian style. If this will not be the case, Slovenia and Italy will go back to the future under the disguise of safety concerns. In this case the biggest price will be paid by those whom these measures are supposed to protect - the people.",politics,"['social issue', 'politics']"
Central bank to relax restrictions on crediting in July,"The Slovenian central bank will relax in July the macroprudential measure that restricts crediting of consumers, with the new lower limit of creditworthiness to be based on essential living expenses and certain additional factors.","After all monthly loan payments have been paid, an individual currently must have at least EUR 915 left each month, and now this threshold is to be lowered to EUR 745, the Bank of Slovenia vice governor Primož Dolenc told the press on Wednesday.

Dolenc said that the calculation of a consumer's annual income would also take into account the child benefit some other social security benefits that had not been included so far.

The central bank will introduce a uniform limit on the ratio between the annual debt servicing cost and the borrower's annual net income.

It will be set at 50% regardless of the amount of income, as opposed to the 67% ratio that is currently set for high incomes, while the share of permitted exceptions will be reduced from 10% to 3%, Dolenc announced.

""The basic idea of the move is to recognise the creditworthiness of the narrow circle of people who are currently officially not creditworthy, while in our expert opinion they are actually able to repay a certain loan,"" he said.

These are people whose net salary ranges from the minimum to the average wage and for whom the amount used to determine creditworthiness has so far been set at 76% of the minimum wage, Dolenc explained.

The changes eliminate the impact of a significant increase in the minimum gross wage on the creditworthiness of borrowers and address the issue of limited access to credit for borrowers with incomes up to the average wage, he said.

""While doing so, we maintain a balance between the protection of consumers and banks and the availability of loans,"" Dolenc noted.

The vice governor explained that the leap in the minimum wage had made it impossible for people with the lowest wages to get a loan. ""The Bank of Slovenia tried to address this segment of consumers last year by introducing the 10% exemption rule.""

However, the data from the central bank shows that banks utilised this permitted share of exemptions to a very small extent last year, while it increased to around 7% in the first quarter of this year when it comes to housing loans.

The Bank of Slovenia has calculated that the creditworthiness of potential borrowers with low incomes will increase, while there will be practically no changes for people with higher incomes.

The maximum instalment will be EUR 133 for those with a net income of EUR 878, around EUR 170 for those with a net income of EUR 1,000-1,500, while there will be practically no difference for those with incomes above EUR 1,800 net.

The maximum instalment for a couple with a net income that equals the net average wage and with one child may rise to EUR 898, for a couple with two children to EUR 678, for a couple with three children to EUR 521, and for a single-parent family with one child to EUR 262.

The central bank does not expect this measure to result in a significant increase in the demand for loans, as the number of borrowers with a very low income is relatively small. ""But we are giving them this option,"" Dolenc said.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'labour']"
"Committee okays changes to party financing, SDS abstains","The Home Policy Committee okayed on Tuesday amendments to the Political Parties Act which include a revised system of political party funding. Deputies of the Democrats (SDS) abstained, and the opposition proposal that parties could also get funds from sole proprietors and legal entities not owned by the state was voted down.","The amendments, which had been filed by the three ruling coalition parties and the opposition New Slovenia (NSi), and which are based on recommendations from the Court of Audit, were backed in a 10:0 vote.

The most important change refers to the financing of deputy groups and deputies from the national budget. Under the current rules, a party can win up to 50% of state funding intended for deputy groups and deputies, which would now be raised to 70%.

The current project financing would be changed to regular, monthly payments, which could be adjusted during the year.

One of the proposed solutions is also to abolish the ten-year-old system under which 25% of the funds intended for political parties is divided among the parties that have won at least 1% of the vote and the rest proportionally according to the election result. The initiators of the changes would like to reintroduce the system with 10% and 90% ratios, respectively.

Under the proposal, only parties that annually receive or are eligible for at least EUR 100,000 in budgetary or local communities' funds are subject to a mandatory audit by the Court of Audit.

The changes also lower the lowest possible fines for most violations and scrap the provision under which those breaking certain laws may be stripped of the right to be funded from the national or local communities' budgets.

Lenart Žavbi of the senior coalition Freedom Movement said today that one of the main goals was to ensure more stable financing of parliamentary and non-parliamentary parties and to eliminate administrative issues in parties' operations.

The committee rejected amendments filed by the SDS and NSi under which political parties could also obtain funds from sole proprietors and legal entities that are not directly or indirectly owned by the state.

SDS deputy Anja Bah Žibert said that such a solution would increase transparency.

The parliamentary legal service, meanwhile, raised issue with the proposal under which parties could use the budget funds intended for the functioning of deputy groups for their operations.

It said that in the system of separation of powers, the basis of the functioning of the National Assembly is respect for parliamentary autonomy, noting that deputy groups are not necessarily connected to the functioning of parties.

The legal service also noted the proposed significant reduction in the funding of political parties that win at least 1% of the vote while failing the reach the parliament threshold of 4%.

Unlike parliamentary parties, these parties would not be able to compensate for the loss of funding by raising the funding reserved to expert assistance to MPs or other financial resources, it added.

The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption pointed to the changes being fast-tracked in parliament, saying that the debate on such a systemic law should include broader public, and in particular non-parliamentary parties.

The changes concern these parties directly, the commission said, also noting that, as they concern the use of public funds, they should contain provisions that effectively address corruption risks.",politics,['politics']

Summer storms caused record damage on forest roads,"Summer storms have caused the greatest damage ever recorded on forest road infrastructure, the Forest Service said on Wednesday. About 15% of all woodland in Slovenia is currently inaccessible by road and repairs are estimated at EUR 50 million.","While the July storms with strong winds toppled trees, the heavy rain that hit Slovenia in early August mainly affected roads, the Forest Service said.

Damage is worst in northern Slovenia, in the basins of the rivers Drava, Savinja, Kamniška Bistrica, Sora and Mura. A total of over 1,500 kilometres of forest roads were damaged in 67 of Slovenia's 212 municipalities.

Most roads remain closed, preventing access not only to woodland but also to isolated farms, hamlets and tourist accommodation. This is the case above all in Koroška, the Upper Savinja Valley and Gorenjska, said the service.

Mostly, damage on forest roads was caused by debris flow, landslides and cave-ins. Bridges, retaining walls and other road infrastructure were also damaged.

""Still, many forest roads remain closed due to July windthrow."" This is the worst damage ever recorded on forest roads in Slovenia, the service added.

An initial estimate indicates that repair works worth EUR 50 million will be needed to make roads safe again, including for wood transport.

The service is worried above all that inaccessibility of woodland will contribute to the spread of bark beetle over the next years, causing further damage.

Forest owners are not eligible for compensation, but they are eligible for co-financing of repair works.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'human interest']"

Minister says conscientious objection may be introduced for state attorneys,"Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan has told the newspaper Dnevnik that her ministry is considering introducing conscientious objection for state attorneys. In an interview released on Saturday she also spoke about the reform of the judicial network, shortages of judges and prosecutors, and the plan to codify femicide as a crime.","The autonomy of the State Attorneys Office must be strengthened, she told Dnevnik's Saturday edition Objektiv, as the office should never again bring damages actions against protesters for reimbursement of the costs of protest policing.

This occurred under the previous government, which tasked the Office with bringing legal actions against protesters taking part in ""Friday anti-government protests"".

The case has reopened the issue of the regulation governing the work of the Office that is steered by the government's decisions, and last year the minister told the STA that she would like to see safeguards in the legislation that would prevent such an abuse of the institution as seen during the previous, Janez Janša-led government.

Now, Švarc Pipan revealed that a solution was in the making that would provide the state attorney with ""the possibility of some sort of conscientious objection"".

She reiterated that under the planned reform seeking to optimise the judicial network, the ministry did not intend to abolish individual courts. She believes that such a reform should be implemented in several stages and has vowed to take into consideration the opinions of local communities and the principle of balanced development.

She sees the withdrawal of an emergency bill that would have ensured a temporary bonus of EUR 600 for judges and prosecutors as a defeat, because she believes the proposal was good and could have been acceptable with a few adjustments.

The minister is concerned that pay issues are one of the reasons for decreased interest in pursuing a career as a judge or a prosecutor. If the ministry does not address this now, she believes that within a few years Slovenia will face a staffing crisis in judiciary similar to the one currently affecting healthcare.

Since killings of women have been on the rise recently, the minister would like to see femicide included in the Criminal Code as a crime. Efforts to make this happen will begin in the autumn, she added.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"

Delo rebukes Golob over latest comments,"The newspaper Delo writes about disappointment at the government's track record in Wednesday's commentary, lambasting Prime Minister Robert Golob over his stand on taxes and bear culling.","The paper notes that the government is facing a vote of no confidence today and although the opposition Democrats (SDS) are not expected to succeed, there will be additional pressure on the government in the form of a rally in front of the parliament building.

As the coalition says it will take the opportunity to present the results of its work, the paper finds analyses of its job have been mostly unanimous - ""mostly it is a disappointment after (too) high expectations and the actual delivery by a poorly operational government, with many promises and little in the way of substantive action"".

Rashness and personal vengeance are not statesmanlike, the paper says, noting the importance of proper communication, ""such that does not leave the public confused when the left hand does one thing and the right another"".

As an example the paper cites two interventions by Golob; ""Earlier in the week, he raised eyebrows when he said the tax reform was not meant to fill the budget, although the finance minister had previously been working on increasing the tax take.

""The latest one exceeded all expectations,"" the paper says about Golob's calling on the minister for natural resources and spatial planning to suspend the decision on the culling of brown bears to allow a reconsideration of the quota.

""It is no wonder, then, that the public is losing trust in almost all the country's institutions,"" the paper concludes under the headline Golob Putting Foot in His Mouth.",politics,['politics']
Delo lists why Lek investment is important,"The newspaper Delo hails Lek's US$400 million investment in a biosimilar production facility in Lendava in Friday's commentary, pointing out three of the aspects that make the investment important.","Firstly, the Sandoz division is in the process of spinning off from Novartis, and it is not yet clear how the process will affect Lek. However, Sandoz's biggest investment in Slovenia is a ""sign of its intention to create a strong core in Slovenia. The investment could also mitigate potential negative consequences of the separation at Lek's other Slovenian locations"".

Secondly, the paper points to the value added of the investment, which it says has become more important than how many jobs foreign direct investment creates. ""Value added is averagely too low in the Slovenian economy. It is thus good that the pharmaceutical industry as a high value added activity is developing in Slovenia. It is not just Novartis and Sandoz which invest, Krka is planning a new plant with several hundred jobs in Krško too.""

Thirdly, the paper notes the importance of the investment for Prekmurje as one of Slovenia's least developed regions whose population is the oldest. ""Slovenia's decentralisation is an important element of the country's future development. The gift that the Basel stork brings to the home plains will thus be a fine one. Economic development will see storks bring new babies to Prekmurje in their beaks more often,"" concludes the commentary Stork's Gift to Home Plains.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'human interest']"
Competition watchdog drops Telekom monopoly case after 20 years,"The Competition Protection Agency (AVK) has stopped a monopoly procedure against Telekom Slovenije nearly two decades after launching an investigation into alleged abuse of dominant position by forcing customers to buy ISDN technology, the telco incumbent said in a press release on Friday.","The procedure was launched in October 2004 upon a report by a consumer, as Telekom made the use of ADSL technology conditional on a prior purchase of ISDN technology.

In late October 2013, the AVK found Telekom had abused its dominant position between 1 December 2002 and 5 September 2005. Telekom challenged the decision, but the Administrative Court sided with the AVK.

Telekom then turned to the Supreme court, which annulled the decision, citing violation of substantive law, and ordered a retrial in December 2014. The second time around the Administrative Court sided with Telekom and ordered the agency to open the case again.

Today Telekom was informed by the AVK that the procedure had been stopped. In line with instructions from the court, the AVK was unable to find proof of an appropriate technical solution before 3 March 2005, as well as calculations of economic effects, the press release said.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice', 'economy, business and finance']"
"Golob, Zelensky talk Slovenia's role in post-war recovery of Ukraine","Prime Minister Robert Golob met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Friday to assure him that Slovenia wants to participate in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, especially the Kharkiv province. Golob and Zelensky also talked about Ukraine's progress in the expected accession to the EU and NATO.","The Slovenian prime minister said in the talks with Zelensky that Slovenia was interested in participating in the recovery of Ukraine, noting the readiness to work on the post-war reconstruction of the Kharkiv province, especially the city of Izium.

The city of Kharkiv and Slovenia's second largest city of Maribor have been twinned since 2012, and the building housing the Slovenian consulate there was destroyed by a Russian rocket in the very first days of the attack on Ukraine, the prime minister's office said.

Golob and Zelensky also talked about Ukraine's progress in the expected accession to the EU and NATO. ""Slovenia welcomes the European Council's decision to grant the candidate status to Ukraine,"" Golob said.

National security discussed as forces of disintegration gain ground,"Trained and dedicated staff are the foundation of national security systems, while disintegration forces are currently prevailing in the world, according some experts who addressed the opening event at National Security Days, the 7th conference on national security, held in Ljubljana.","The factors of disintegration have recently prevailed in the international community over the factors of integration, Iztok Prezelj, dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, said on Tuesday.

This can be seen in the marked acceleration of the conflict in Ukraine, the rise of China, the collapse of the European idea of peace in Afghanistan, the biggest terrorist attack in Israel since 9/11, and climate change.

Prezelj believes that these conflicts are all the more dangerous in the wake of the Covid pandemic, during which experts became just another voice in a mass of expert and non-expert opinions.

He said that apart from the mentioned problems, European society is polarising internally, as some want to use violence to regulate the existing social relations.

Igor Bernik, dean of the Faculty of Security Studies, agreed with Prezlej in that there is no efficient security system without dedicated individuals.

He sees the energy sector as a key challenge for the security of Slovenian society in the coming years.

The main question is how to tackle the challenges of the climate crisis and how to ensure that citizens live in a safe and healthy environment.

Digitalisation is another major challenge, which raises issues of cyber security, personal data, digital ethics and digital discrimination, Bernik said.

Defence Minister Marjan Šarec meanwhile believes that digitalisation will never fully replace humans.

He said this could be seen in the latest escalation of violence in the Middle East - while Israel's defence and security system was seen as one of the best in the world, ""it fell asleep"" this time.

In Šarec's view, investment in the defence and security system should be made at a time of peace, so that it is not too late when a conflict breaks out. ""Then those who wonder why we need this system, wonder why it has failed.""

He also noted positive staffing trends in the Slovenian army, saying that the number of staff arriving exceeded the number of those leaving in September.

Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar praised the police work during the floods, especially its protection of critical infrastructure and of property left behind by those who were evacuated.

Another important area of security is migration, where his ministry is working on a migration and integration strategy, he said, adding that it was essential for the country to respond to it in an effective and timely manner.

National Security Days are organised by the Institute for Security Culture, the Association for Safe World, the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty of Security Studies.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'environmental issue', 'politics']"
Finance sceptical there will be less administration for businesses,"The business newspaper Finance welcomes European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's announcement in her state of the union address that there will be less administration for businesses in the future. However, she intends to fight it with a new law, with new rules, which Finance says does not bode well for any real change.","Von der Leyen said in her address on Wednesday that one of the EU's three main economic challenges is how to make European business easier and less burdened by reporting.

She highlighted administration faced by SMEs, and announced a law to reduce their EU-wide reporting requirements by 25%, but added that this would not be an easy task.

She also said this would foremost have to happen at national level, but Finance says that the Commission itself should do its share of the job, as it is for instance introducing ever new laws and requirements for the green transition.

The reason Finance is sceptical about the outcome of von der Leyen's announcement is also a number of new requirements that Slovenian companies have to adhere to.

One case requiring a lot of administration is channels that companies must set up for whistleblowers to safely report violations of rules.

Large companies had to do it until mid-May, while those with 50 to 249 employees must do so by 17 December.

Finance also highlights detailed records of the working hours of all workers that companies must keep, and the planned mandatory solidarity post-flood contribution.

Another administrative ""highlight"" will be companies having to report job vacancies at the Employment Service, a solution abolished with a labour reform 10 years ago, says the commentary Administration Piling Up for Slovenian Companies while EU Promises Less Administration.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'politics', 'labour']"
Two health reform bills unveiled (adds),The Health Ministry unveiled on Tuesday two bills that form the first part of the health reform package. The health IT system bill creates a new state-owned company to develop and maintain a centralised IT system. The bill on the ZZZS centres around an overhaul of the management structure of the public health insurer.,"The healthcare IT system legislation envisages requires that all health care providers share documentation with a central IT system. A new state-owned company would be established to be in charge of the system's maintenance and development.

In place of the existing 80 or so databases, there would be only six broad databases covering all relevant healthcare documentation and other data. The new company would be financed by the national budget and from ZZZS and EU funds.

While the legislation will leave existing data at hospitals intact, it will prescribe standards for the flow of data and their structure. It will also give patients the right to determine which data they want to share and who has access to the data.

""I am confident that the majority of the people want comprehensive treatment, but some have valid reasons to conceal data about their health, for example due to stigmatisation in society,"" said Alenka Kolar of the Health Ministry's Digitalisation Directorate.

The bill reforming the ZZZS overhauls the management by reducing the existing assembly from 45 to 11 members, whereby the representatives of policyholders would retain the majority. The director general would be replaced by a three-member management board.

Health Ministry State Secretary Tjaša Vidic said the roles of all stakeholders are more precisely defined in order to mitigate a ""systemic conflict of interest"" and make governance more effective. The state's role would be ""more active"".

""We think the way the law is written it facilitates a much more active cooperation between the two stakeholders in the health system, the Health Ministry and the state,"" she said about provisions that she said were ""a key element"" of the reform.

Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan said the government was looking forward to the 30-day public consultation and is confident a broader consensus on the future of healthcare can be achieved.

He expects the debate to be ""exceptionally heated"" since the legislation requires a change of mindset but believes that ""we are at a point where society is mature enough to quickly recognise selfish vested interests and exclude them from public debate.""

The legislation was presented today to social partners at a session of the Economic and Social Council. Both employers and trade unions were critical, in particular about the overhaul of the ZZZS, where both groups currently wield significant power via their representatives.

""The desired changes are not a step in the right direction because they weaken the influence of employer organisations by reducing the number of members,"" said Blaž Cvar, the president of the Chamber of Trade Crafts and Small Business (OZS).

Jakob Počivavšek, the chair of the Pergam trade union and himself a member of the ZZZS assembly, similarly said that the reduction of the members of the assembly would reduce the ZZZS's autonomy as he accused the government of trying to co-opt the ZZZS.

""We think the concept must be fundamentally changed in order to achieve a consensus,"" he said.

There were fewer complaints about the health IT system bill as there is broad agreement that the health sector must be digitised. There were however questions about the state-owned company managing the system.

Representatives of employers wanted to know how high the cost will be, whereas trade unions questioned whether setting up this company is a way to give workers there higher wages than they would have in the public sector.

""We see it as a way to bypass the public sector wage system ... This could create a dangerous precedent and lead to privatisation,"" said Irena Ilešič Čujovič, president of the Trade Union of Health and Social Care.",health,"['health', 'politics', 'human interest']"
Večer says govt sending subtle messages to flood victims,"Commenting on the government's handing of the situation with the people of Struge, whose homes were damaged in the August floods and are still at risk due to a looming landslide, the newspaper Večer says on Monday that although people were advised to move at least temporarily no concrete instructions were issued for an immediate move.","Thus, the responsibility still, even after the government's visit to the Savinja Valley, lies with the people who have difficulty deciding what to do amid the many misleading information.

""Why has the government not made a decision? Because there is no legal basis for such a move and it does not want to get into trouble, some say, including those who still live in the flood-prone and dangerous areas and are said to be praying that this autumn will not be too wet.""

Personally the officials said they would not want to live in such areas, so if the locals can read between the lines they are already packing their bags and looking for places to move.

Some people from Trbiž, Rastke and other places need no convincing that they live in a danger zone. They know it all too well, as they nearly escaped death. ""But where to start fresh? With what? The government representatives have not paid them a visit. What could they tell them? There are still no promised substitute locations. The state has not approved them yet, because there is no legal basis.""

PM Robert Golob made it clear during the visit that people whose homes were flooded are not responsible for this, as some may have hinted, as all the buildings had construction permits, written by experts.

""This flooding has brought one big message to be read between the lines: water needs space and if it cannot find it in the fields where officials cannot reach an agreement with farmers ... it will find it among buildings,"" reads the commentary entitled Messages Between the Lines.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'social issue', 'politics']"
"Govt to discuss introducing border checks with Croatia, Hungary","After Italy announced checks on its border with Slovenia due to the changed situation in Europe and the Middle East, the government will discuss on Thursday introducing controls at the borders with Croatia and Hungary. Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar has already notified his Croatian and Hungarian counterparts of this.","The government will decide today on a notice to the European Commission about this which Slovenia is obligated to send to Brussels under the Schengen Code.

Italy is to introduce the border checks on Saturday for at least ten days with the possibility of extension. Several countries have recently introduced or decided to extend controls at the internal Schengen borders due to the migratory pressure and the situation in the Middle East.

Austria, which introduced controls on the border with Slovenia and Hungary in 2015 at the peak of the refugee crisis, notified the European Commission on Monday that it would extend it again, from 12 November this year to 11 May 2024.

Ahead of the government session on Thursday, the interdepartmental task force for counter-terrorism raised the level of terrorist threat in Slovenia from low to medium.

It said this was done ""due to the current heightened security situation in Europe and the Middle East and calls to carry out terrorist acts.""",politics,"['politics', 'human interest']"

"Poklukar wants to tackle corruption, manage migration, depoliticise police","The nominee for interior minister, Boštjan Poklukar, listed the fight against corruption; management of migrations; and the police force's depoliticisation, professionalisation and modernisation as top priories in a hearing before the parliamentary Home Affairs Committee, which then backed his nomination in a 9:6 vote on Monday.","Poklukar served as interior minister in the Marjan Šarec government (2018-2020) and is replacing Tatjana Bobnar after her resignation over alleged political meddling in the police force.

He argued his good knowledge of the field, including due to his experience at the Defence Ministry and the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, was a major benefit.

He welcomed the Interior Ministry's investment-oriented budget for 2023 and 2024, saying it was key that the modernisation of the police force be secured. He also argued in favour of increasing the number of people employed in the force.

The 51-year-old member of the senior coalition Freedom Movement said he would implement the coalition agreement-announced zero tolerance of corruption, effective prosecution of crime and effective investigation of suspect projects and investments, including the procurement of protective equipment during the epidemic.

One of his first moves will be issuing mandatory guidelines to the police to prioritise the tackling of corruption.

Poklukar announced the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) will again be autonomous and independent, with one of the changes to allow for it to be led by experts in law enforcement, criminal justice, intelligence and security, not just a police officer.

As regards the management of migration, he pointed to the changed circumstances following Croatia's joining the Schengen area last month and explained the aim is to have no more razor wire on the border with Croatia by the end of the year.

Poklukar also called for a prompt adoption a new migration strategy that will take into account the changing global context and developments in our neighbourhood, with absolute respect for human rights and with an emphasis on the protection of vulnerable groups.

He announced an overhaul of severals laws - the foreigners act, the international protection act, the act on temporary protection of displaced persons and the act on public assembly.

In the context for the depoliticisation, professionalisation and modernisation of the police force, he announced changes to the appointment process for the police commissioner, to the two key laws governing the police, which, he said, need systemic safeguards to ""prevent political intrusion into police affairs"".

He also intends to strive for a career ladder system for police staff, which has already been called for by the two police trade unions. Poklukar moreover feels that education and training programmes should be reviewed and imbued with a greater emphasis on the basics of the police code of ethics.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice', 'politics']"
Govt sets out budget expenditure for 2024 and 2025 (adds),"The government has endorsed a breakdown of budget expenditure for 2024 and 2025, reducing the 2024 spending cap by EUR 300 million to EUR 15.2 billion. The figure is to increase to EUR 15.9 billion in 2025.","Speaking after the cabinet session on Monday, Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič said it would be fiscally unsustainable and harmful to the country and citizens to finance all the wishes.

The government started working on budgets for the next two years in late May when the Finance Ministry said they were aiming to reduce the general government deficit below 3% of GDP in 2024 and then further.

Today, Boštjančič said overall budget expenditure in 2024 was projected at EUR 15.2 billion. The figure is about EUR 300 million lower than the 2024 budget passed by parliament in November 2022.

""Such a level makes it possible to address key development goals and government priorities over the next period on the one hand, while making sure fiscal spending is rational, on the other,"" he said.

He finds successful tapping on EU cohesion funds and the recovery and resilience fund crucial for investment projects.

Despite the decrease, expenditure in 2024 will still be 10% above that in 2022 and more than 50% higher than in the pre-Covid year of 2019.

Budget expenditure in 2025 is expected to increase to EUR 15.9 billion.

This would allow the government to pursue the key priorities of the coalition agreement, the minister said, listing healthcare, knowledge and youth. ""These three priorities can be seen in the budget,"" he said.

The government is also following the fiscal rules, which will return into force next year.

Boštjančič would not say which government departments saw the biggest spending cuts or which the biggest increase. ""There're no winners or losers,"" he said.

A comparison with the adopted budget is not possible because the ministries have been reorganised and funds for individual programmes are budgeted with different users.

A breakdown drawn up by the Finance Ministry suggests the Health Ministry will get EUR 192 million less in budget, but Boštjančič said part of the ministry's funds were currently still budgeted under the Finance Ministry's headings, mentioning EUR 300 million worth of measures. The same holds for long-term care.

Funds for all budget users together are being reduced by EUR 283 million and judiciary users by EUR 600,000, while all non-governmental budget users will get EUR 3 million more than planned so far.

More funds will be available for the president's office, the Constitutional Court and the National Assembly and less for the National Electoral Commission and the prime minister's office, for example.

Individual ministries now have until 22 August to come up with proposals for their financial plans, and Boštjančič said that all budget users were unhappy in a way but understood the situation.

Due to crises over the past two years, he said everyone got used to the idea that there were almost unlimited funds, which was obviously not the case.

The Finance Ministry has advised budget users to try to obtain funds for investment from EU funds, where there is a considerable amount of money for energy efficiency.

The government needs to adopt the budget documents and submit them to parliament by 1 October at the latest. The final estimates of budget revenue and deficit will be available then.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'politics']"
Evacuation under way in Meža Valley,"An evacuation started late Saturday night of the Meža Valley due to what local media report is a major looming landslide upstream of Črna na Koroškem, one of the towns worst hit by massive flooding that Slovenia has been experiencing since Friday.","The evacuation was first announced by the Mežica municipality late on Saturday and Večer newspaper reports that a helicopter evacuation was due to start this morning in an attempt to bring about 100 people who had previously been evacuated to a local centre for disabled persons to safety.

Večer says the helicopter evacuation effort is currently hampered by bad visibility and fog.

It took until yesterday for the army to reach Črna, located in a narrow valley close to the border with Austria, which had been cut off by landslides and destroyed bridges.",disaster and accident,['disaster and accident']
Civil initiative protests against expansion of production at Lesonit,"A civil initiative has come out against a government decision in favour of an environmental permit for a ramping up of production at Lesonit, an Ilirska Bistrica-based manufacturer of fibreboards and laminated boards.","The Eko Bistrc initiative said on Friday that the Environment Agency lists Lesonit as the country's number one emitter of the carcinogen formaldehyde. The local population has for years been enduring emissions of harmful substances, wood dust particles, along with stench and noise pollution.

The group said the government, having been contacted by Lesonit, told the Environment Ministry to issue a permit for a 30% production increase by 30 October even though the ministry has not yet established grounds to do so.

Moreover, in June the municipality if Ilirska Bistrica, south-west, ordered a review of noise measurement documents, which discovered so many discrepancies and errors that ""there is a justified suspicion of manipulation"", Maja Mejak of Eko Bistrc told the press in Ljubljana.

The case is also being followed by Eko Krog, an environmental NGO, whose Uroš Macerl said a review of all the documents had shown ""the impact on the quality of life and health is already so big there that things need to be remedied immediately, not made worse"".

Eko Krog successfully took on Lafarge Cement, the Slovenian subsidiary of the Switzerland-headquartered multinational LafargeHolcim, a few years ago and Macerl said that while he had seen much by way of pressure, fraud, passive inspectorates in that case, there had not been a government letter demanding a permit.

""This goes beyond all reasonable norms. This kind of political interference in the granting of a permit, where experts should have the main say, is unacceptable and takes us deep into the past,"" Macerl said, stressing that the letter hurts especially in the light of the pledges regarding the environment the current government made before the elections.

While hoping the ministry will stand its ground, Eko Bistrc announced an appeal at the Administrative Court in case a permit is indeed issued.",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'crime, law and justice', 'human interest']"
Locals stage protest as investors present Pohorje wind farms project,"Representatives of the company Energija na Veter, which plans to build 56 wind turbines in the Pohorje hills, presented the project to locals on Thursday together with experts who assessed the project's impact on the environment. The mayors or Slovenska Bistrica and Ruše were also invited, but did not attend. A few dozen opponents staged a rally.","Jana Habjan from Energija na Veter said that even though the wind farm in Pohorje was expected to have no notable negative effects on the environment and the people, the investor was open for talks with locals, who oppose the project.

She also highlighted the opportunities for developing green tourism, following the example of many other countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where wind farms are often placed near ski centres. ""Wind farms require much less space than solar farms. One requires an area of 40x70 metres, which is reduced to 30x30 metres when completed,"" explained Habjan.

She said that the project had been developed step by step for five years, and that the first thing checked was whether the area provided enough wind. According to her, expert analyses have shown that Pohorje is the only suitable location to provide almost 200 megawatts of electricity, which would flow into the grid at the substations in Ruše and Slovenska Bistrica.

""We are now at a very important point, where the project needs to be accepted by locals and politicians, which is very challenging, but we are ready for dialogue and seeking additional concessions,"" said Habjan, noting that the benefits for the locals included cheaper electricity, and even free electricity for those closest to the wind farm. It would also bring the municipality of Slovenska Bistrica EUR 2.7 million annually.

Geologist and hydrologist Jože Janež presented the impact on waters. The area of Trije Kralji and Areh, where the wind turbines are planned, is classified as a third-class water protection area, he noted.

Wind farms do not discharge any waste water or process water during their operation and the chemicals used to lubricate the drive parts are present in such small quantities that they would not end up in the environment, but inside the facility, he said.

However, greater care for local water sources would be needed during the construction works due to road and pit construction and the associated transport, said Janež, adding that any problems could be avoided if the construction site was well organised.

Concerns regarding the need to build new roads in Pohorje for the transport of materials and components for the wind turbines were answered by Jakob Muršak, assistant project designer for the construction part of the project, who said that the wind turbines would be set up mostly directly next to existing roads. Where this is not possible, temporary access roads of up to 100 metres long would be made that could be replanted with trees later on.

Chief engineer Marjan Bezjak, who was also involved in the construction of the two wind farms in the western Primorska region, answered concerns regarding the potential impact of electromagnetic waves around the wind turbines. He asserted that there was no electromagnetic waves outside the cables that exceeded the permitted levels.

Before the presentation, a few dozen locals and members of a civil initiative opposing the wind farms gathered in front of the hotel where the presentation was held, but they refused to listen to the arguments of the investors and experts.

""Even today, on an ordinary working day, quite a few of us have gathered. I believe that on a weekend or a day off, there will be many more. The state will get a resounding no and they will have to realise that Pohorje people do not want this in our environment. There are degraded areas available for this and they should do such things there,"" said Robi Lesjak, a representative of the civil initiative and a municipal councillor in Oplotnica.",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'human interest']"
Energy in focus as Croatian PM visits Slovenia,"Slovenian and Croatian prime ministers, Robert Golob and Andrej Plenković, agreed that the countries would sign a solidarity agreement on gas supply, as Plenković visited Slovenia on Tuesday. Moreover, Slovenia is interested in helping increase the capabilities of the Krk gas terminal and pipelines.","""All conditions are met and texts finalised so that we can sign a solidarity agreement on energy, above all pipelines, between our countries at the earliest opportunity,"" Golob told the press after his meeting with Plenković. The latter said the agreement could be signed during Golob's upcoming official visit to Zagreb.

The prime ministers also discussed the planned expansion of a liquefied gas terminal on the Croatian island of Krk. The terminal could become an entry point for joint EU gas supply, which means the project could be eligible for EU funds.

The capabilities of gas pipelines of the terminal with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary and Slovenia, as well as beyond, with Austria and Bavaria, are also to be improved.

The prime ministers also talked about the possibility of building a new nuclear unit at the Krško nuclear plant, which the two countries co-own. Both governments support a new generator, said Golob, adding it will be important to see whether nuclear energy will be deemed clean by the EU, making it eligible for EU funds.

Moreover, Golob and Plenković talked about illegal migrations, discussing how Croatia, Slovenia and Italy could perform joint control of corridors used by illegal migrants to reach Italy.",politics,"['politics', 'environmental issue']"
Most Slovenian tourist sites safe to visit (adds),"Some of Slovenia's tourism providers have suffered considerable damage in the devastating floods that hit the country, but tourism officials say that most of the country's tourism destinations are safe to visit.","""Most of Slovenia is now safe and open to tourists. In most regions, the tourism industry provides for a smooth arrival and comfortable stay of guests,"" Martina Gojkošek, head of corporate communication at the Slovenian Tourist Board (STO), told the STA.

The STO advises visitors to stay up to date on the developments by following information on the Slovenian-English portal Slovenia.info. Practical floods-related information for tourists is available at sta.si/qOrsUb.

Fedja Pobegajlo, the head of the Chamber of Tourism and Hospitality, has told the STA that the spa company Thermana Laško south of Celje and the campsites in the Savinja Valley in the north appear to have been hit hardest by the floods.

Thermana Laško's preliminary estimate is that material damage and damage to business will reach between EUR 3.5 million and EUR 5 million.

The biggest challenge will be repairing the pool engine rooms in the basement of Thermana Park Hotel, which are needed to open the swimming pools, and replacing the equipment and redecorating the ground floor of the Laško Spa Hotel. The spa park has also been destroyed.

The damage to the pool engine rooms is not known yet, ""but we assess that it will be extremely high"". Repairs will take several weeks, while hotel and hospitality services resumed on Monday.

For guests who have booked their summer holidays at the spa swimming has been organised at the nearby spas of Rimske Terme, Terme Olimia and Terme Zreče.

The damage sustained at campsites in the Savinja Valley will be inspected on Tuesday.

""Apart from direct damage, another problem is that tourists are coming back reluctantly even though business continues as usual at most destinations,"" Pobegajlo said.

The chamber is working with the STO to send out this message to the visitors and they expect bookings to start going up again in a few days.

STO director Maja Pak also underscored that most destinations remain safe and open for guests and visitors.

The Kamnik Tourist Board said that most of the tourism and accommodation providers in this municipality north of Ljubljana are open for business, including the Terme Snovik spa complex and Slovenia Eco Resort. The Arboretum Volčji Potok reopened on Tuesday but there will be minor repairs there at times.

Hiking trails and mountain huts from the direction of Kamnik are closed for the time being but access is possible to the Menina Planina plateau. The Velika Planina plateau and the Kamniška Bistrica Valley and Črna Valley are inaccessible, including the Tunjice glamping.

All tourism providers and sites are also open in Škofja Loka. The Selca Valley has not been affected by the floods, except for the Soriška Planina campsite, which is currently closed, the local tourist board said. They also advise against visiting the Poljane Valley and the town of Žiri, which was hit hard by the floods.

The STO listed several other places that are safe to visit, including the Julian Alps, and the Soča Valley although the river is closed for navigation at some sections.

The Bled municipality is also a safe destination, but the Pokljuka and Vintgar gorges are closed to visitors at the moment. The Vintgar Gorge will reopen on 15 August.

Caution is advised when hiking outdoors in the Radovljica municipality as sections of several mountain and theme trails are blocked by fallen trees or ruined by water. Some roads and sites are also closed in Begunje na Gorenjskem.",disaster and accident,"['lifestyle and leisure', 'disaster and accident']"
Migrant rights groups say systematic deportations to Croatia continuing,"NGOs and migrant rights groups from Slovenia, Croatia and the wider region told a public debate on deportations in Ljubljana on Thursday that no stop has been put to systematic deportations of migrants to Croatia, which then directly returns them to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They have called for a substantive processing of asylum applications.","Miha Blažič, a member of the Ljubljana-based Ambasada Rog migrant rights group, said the groups are calling on the Slovenian Interior Ministry to properly process asylum application and end the systematic rejections. He argued that the official figure of only eight persons being returned to Croatia last year did not reflect the actual number of deportation decisions issued.

Metka Naglič from Amnesty International Slovenija echoed Blažič's claims, adding that in Croatia the asylum applicants were subject to violence and to fast-track returns to Bosnia-Herzegovina. She said this is being confirmed not only by NGOs but also by institutions like the European Human Rights Ombudsman and the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

The public discussion also featured members of No Name Kitchen, an independent movement working alongside the Balkans and the Mediterranean routes, and the Croatian Centre for Peace Studies, while the Interior Ministry cancelled its announced participation.

Meanwhile, Blažič also took the opportunity to welcome the legislative changes allowing asylum seekers in Slovenia to enter the job market after three as opposed to nine months. However, to his knowledge, employers have been given discretionary right when it comes to the validity of work permits for asylum seekers without original documents, which Blažič said again meant uncertainty for the applicants.","crime, law and justice","['social issue', 'crime, law and justice']"
Thousands gather in Ljubljana city centre to demand decent pensions (adds),"Thousands of protesters gathered in Republic Square in the centre of Ljubljana on Wednesday to demand decent pensions, which they see as their right, as part of a rally organised by The Voice of Pensioners, a civil society group initiated by Pavel Rupar, a former MP for the Democrats (SDS). Several senior SDS members attended.","When Rupar announced the rally in January, he said that pensioners had been let down by everyone in the country.

Rupar told the STA today the rally was to send the message that pensioners were alive and demanded only ""what they had anticipated their whole life, what they had believed in and hoped for"".

He said pensioners had found themselves in a crisis and they struggled to make ends meet, so they wanted to talk to decision-makers. Given the number of people gathered today he expects these talks to take place soon.

He estimated that between 18,000 and 20,000 people gathered in Republic Square, but said the police would give the exact estimate. ""I'm very happy about the turnout,"" he said.

According to Rupar, the head of the national umbrella organisation of pensioners ZDUS, MPs, ministers, the prime minister, trade unions and other pensioners' associations had also been invited to the rally but did not turn out.

Unless the protesters' demands are heard, the rallies will continue, but not every week, since they are elderly people, but at the beginning of every month, Rupar said. ""I believe many expect us to run out of strength, but I personally believe the rallies will increase and we will achieve our goals.""

The group demands an immediate 20% rise in pensions that are below EUR 1,000 and a 15% rise in those between EUR 1,000 and 1,500.

The lowest monthly pension should not be lower than EUR 750, while an average pension should reach 75% of the average monthly pay in Slovenia.

The group also demands the 13th pension and an annual allowance in the amount of the pension be written down in the constitution as the pensioners' rights.

The state should moreover pay top-up health insurance for those on a pension below EUR 1,000, as well as the RTV Slovenija licence fee.

Against the backdrop of pop folk music, protesters, among them many old people, joined in with Slovenian flags and banners highlighting their demands.

Some of the slogans read ""We demand decent pensions"", ""Long live Janez Janša, the Slovenian hero in war and peace"", ""We made this country and we want to enjoy the fruits of our labour"".

Speakers addressing the crowd said those who are now pensioners used to wait in long lines for petrol and construction material, and protested in Roška Street against Slovenian citizens being tried in the Serbo-Croatian language.

They also said this generation of pensioners had the most merit for Slovenia's independence, so they wanted to live decently, as pensions were not a social benefit but a right.

ZDUS has meanwhile distanced itself from the rally, warning against populism and manipulation, while acknowledging that many pensioners cannot afford a decent old age.

The association said on Tuesday that pensioners ""are not being cheated in terms of pensions"", but some ""can still not enjoy many benefits because of the legislation that is truly not in favour of pensioners"".

A negative reaction to the appeal for today's rally has also come from Voice of the People, a civil initiative that campaigned against the previous, SDS-led government in 2020-2022, saying it amounted to ""a very harmful misleading of the general public"". It has also said the rally is not organised by the civil society but by ex-SDS MPs Rupar and Mojca Škrinjar.

On the other hand, the group of seniors at the opposition party New Slovenia (NSi) has expressed support for ""all activities and initiatives that promote decent living for pensioners and all other vulnerable groups"". It said yesterday that given the 12% rise in the minimum wage on 1 January this year, ""a 12% pension rise is also urgent"".",labour,"['labour', 'human interest']"
EU Commission okays state aid scheme for Slovenian companies affected by Ukraine war,The European Commission has approved a EUR 100 million state aid scheme in support of companies in Slovenia affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The aid will cover part of the salaries paid by the eligible beneficiaries to employees whose working hours have been reduced.,"The Commission, which said the scheme aims at preserving the employment levels and at avoiding layoffs, found that the Slovenian scheme is in line with the conditions set out in the Temporary Crisis Framework.

""The measure will be open to companies of all sizes and across sectors, with the exception of the financial and insurance one and the processing and marketing of agricultural products sector. In order to be eligible, companies must demonstrate that their energy costs have increased by at least 1.5 times compared to the reference price of 2021,"" the Commission wrote on Tuesday.

The aid will not be allowed to exceed EUR 250,000 per beneficiary active in the primary production of agricultural products, EUR 300,000 per beneficiary active in the fishery and aquaculture sectors and EUR 2 million per beneficiary active in all other sectors. It will be available until 31 December 2023.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"
450th anniversary of peasant revolt marked through art,An exhibition of artworks depicting peasant revolt motives is opening on Wednesday in the Božidar Jakac Gallery in Kostanjevica na Krki as part of a project marking the 450th anniversary of the Croatian-Slovenian Peasant Revolt of 1573.,"The exhibition, curated by Miha Colner and on show until 1 October, features works by many artists, mostly from Slovenia and Croatia, who reflected on peasant revolts in different periods and social circumstances.

One of the largest peasant revolts in the territory of present-day Slovenia was the Croatian-Slovenian Peasant Revolt of 1573, a 12 day rebellion that ended with defeat of the rebels.

One of the revolt's leaders, Matija Gubec, who was executed after the rebellion was quashed, became a symbol of a people's hero resisting foreign authorities for Slovenians and Croatians alike.

There are not many historical sources detailing the 1573 uprising, and it became part of Slovenian and Croatian collective memory only in the second half of the 19th century when Slavic nations were oppressed by the Habsburg and the Hungarian empires.

It was through art that peasant revolts were brought into the public discourse as a symbol of a fight for rights of the underprivileged, Colner said.

Depictions of peasant revolts and their leaders in art flourished when the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was founded, with the revolting peasants being perceived as fighters for freedom. During World War II, Gubec and the revolts were linked to the uprising against occupation.

The peak of artistic depictions of peasant revolts came in socialist Yugoslavia when the revolts were seen as a proletarian and socialist revolution. The largest number of artworks were created on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the revolt in 1973.

After the break-up of Yugoslavia and collapse of socialism, peasant revolts almost completely disappeared from public discourse and art, Colner noted.

The exhibition is part of a joint project of six museums in Croatia and Slovenia, titled Revolt 1573-2023. The activities that started in early 2023 include various art and museum exhibitions, lectures, excursions, film screenings and workshops in both countries.","unrest, conflicts and war","['arts, culture and entertainment']"

Reading literacy of Slovenian ten-year-olds deteriorates,"Slovenian fourth-graders have exhibited a drop in their reading literacy result after years of an upward trend, showed the latest PIRLS 2021 international study. With 520 points, Slovenia still placed above the mean value. Education Minister Darjo Felda says the ministry is drawing up an action plan to remedy the situation.","The drop in results can in part be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic but not entirely, Felda said of the study carried out in spring of 2021 after schools were closed for a longer period of time. He added that a lot can be done as early as in kindergarten.

The PIRLS study is conducted every five years and Slovenia has taken part since its inception in 2001. This is the first downturn in reading literacy for Slovenian pupils, who had previously been improving on their score.

The 6,400 ten-year-olds in the study scored 23 points less than in the 2016 cycle, reporters were told as the results were presented at the ministry on Tuesday. Girls still fared slightly better than boys, but the drop was the same in both genders.

Pupils who have more books, often speak Slovenian at home, and those with parents who love to read did better on the test, said the national research coordinator of PIRLS Eva Klemenčič Mirazchiyski of the Educational Research Institute, adding that results did not differ whether the participants were reading off paper or off the screen.

In Slovenia, the findings did not show major differences between individual schools, but did record huge result variations among the students attending those schools.

On an international level, out of the 57 countries, the majority saw a deterioration while only three improved their previous results. Slovenia's results were comparable with those of Germany, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, Malta, France, Serbia and Albania.

Decision-makers, including the National Council for Reading Literacy will be able to use the results in finalising the action plan to develop reading literacy, as well as include them in the upcoming curricula, Felda said, hoping for better results in the next PIRLS cycle.",education,['education']
Civil servants urged against using TikTok app,"The Government Information Security Office has issued a recommendation, advising all civil servants not to use the social networking platform TikTok on work phones over cybersecurity concerns.","The recommendation is based on analyses of Slovenian and foreign organisations, reads the statement obtained by the STA, which notes that there have been several warnings expressed in the public about concerns related to data collecting from TikTok users.

While many social network apps require permissions to control and access device data, TikTok is more persistent in obtaining them, the government office says.

Employees of the company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, can access user data, which has been abused in the past, the office said.

Tiktok has already been banned from staff devices in all three of the EU's main institutions and in public administration in the US and Canada. Many EU countries have recently issued similar warnings and recommendations.",social issue,"['social issue', 'science and technology']"
MPs pass changes to two energy crisis laws,The National Assembly passed on Tuesday changes to two emergency laws aimed at addressing the energy crisis. The changes will transpose EU rules on joint natural gas purchases and make some adjustments to the collection of the windfall tax imposed on electricity producers.,"In line with the EU regulation, amendments to the Act on Measures for Management of Crisis Conditions in the Field of Energy Supply will see gas suppliers that are balance responsible parties obligated to participate in joint purchases of natural gas at the EU level.

Each operator will be obliged to table a demand for 2.25% of the average annual consumption of the balance responsible parties over the last five years.

Under the proposal, the law no longer requires the establishment of community self-supply and solar electricity projects for companies in which the state or a local community has an equity investment, if the project involves installations with a capacity of more than 250 kilowatts.

The relevant ministry found that the obligation had imposed restrictions on companies in their implementation of community solar projects, rather than encouraging them.

Meanwhile, the changes to the Act on Emergency Intervention to Address High Energy Prices are amending the collection of the windfall tax imposed on electricity suppliers. Under the changes, only electricity producers and not traders anymore will be taxable. This will apply to providers whose installed capacity exceeds 100 kilowatts, and not only those with installation capacity of over 500 kilowatts as was the case so far.

Moreover, the changes introduce an exemption from the windfall tax for electricity generated by imported lignite.

The threshold for determining surplus revenue will be lowered from the current EUR 180 per megawatt-hour to EUR 160 per MWh. These windfall tax collection measures will apply to the 1 December 2022 - 30 June 2023 period.

The coalition parties Freedom Movement and Social Democrats (SD) and the opposition party New Slovenia (NSi) expressed support for the changes, whereas the largest opposition party, the Democrats (SDS), did not.

Freedom Movement's and the SD's MPs believe the changes will make transposing the EU regulations into Slovenian legislation easier. Miroslav Gregorič, MP for the ruling party, said that the proposed price cap for windfall tax had been balanced as the companies' investment capacity also had to be taken into consideration.

Meanwhile, SDS MP Zvonko Černač said that there was no valid reason for lowering the surplus revenue threshold and that this excluded large energy traders like the Gen-I company while putting more pressure on the smaller ones that were already barely breaking even. He was also critical of exempting windfall tax for imported coal, saying that excess market revenues would be collected from electricity generated from renewable sources, but not from coal-fired generation.

State Secretary at the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy Tina Seršen said that the ministry had found that there were a number of small hydro and solar power plants between 100 kW and 500 kW that were selling electricity at very high prices. These producers are part of a support scheme which has provided them with security and a return through public funds, so there is no reason why they should not have part of their revenue collected, she said.

As for traders, she noted that their revenue was already capped with the regulated prices, but they had the option of state compensation to cover the difference between the purchase price and the regulated selling price. Either way, it would turn out they have no surplus market revenues, she added.

Both sets of changes were passed in a 61:0 vote.","economy, business and finance","['crime, law and justice', 'environmental issue', 'economy, business and finance']"
"Slovenian businesses, tourism presented in Texas","Representatives of the Slovenian economy and tourism were presented to potential US business partners at the Texas Feels Slovenia business and investment conference in Dallas on Thursday. According to the organisers, Slovenia was presented as an excellent economic partner, a country of investment opportunities and a sustainable tourist destination.","As part of the conference, US and Slovenian companies and destinations held bilateral meetings to explore the possibility for business cooperation, the Economy Ministry, the Slovenian Tourism Board and the agency Spirit Slovenia said in a press release.

Among the more than 170 participants were representatives of a number of leading US companies in various fields. ""Texas, as the second largest economy in the US and the tenth largest in the world, is a place with great potential for cooperation with our highly export-oriented economy, as well as for the penetration of Texas-based companies on the Slovenian market. At the same time, it is an excellent place for the promotion of Slovenia as a tourist destination,"" said Mitja Blaganje, secretary general at the Ministry of Economy, Tourism and Sport.

Rok Capl, acting head of Spirit Slovenia, noted that the business and investment conference in Dallas was a continuation and an upgrade of a successful business story that started last year. ""We are delighted that so many American business people attended the conference and recognised us as an important business destination, both in terms of creating new partnerships and investment opportunities,"" Capl was quoted as saying in a press release.

Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynt Marshall and London Lions CEO Vanja Černivec stressed that ""with hard work, passion and focus, you can achieve anything in life"". Former Slovenian basketball ace Radoslav Nesterović, who presented Slovenia as a country of sporting champions, echoed this.

Today, the Slovenian delegation will visit several US companies in Dallas, and in the evening a green I feel Slovenia NBA match will be held between the Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls.

The conference organisers believe Dallas is a good starting point for Slovenian companies tapping into the 332-million US market because of the popularity of NBA team Dallas Mavericks star, Slovenia's Luka Dončić.

The conference, which is part of a broader, continuous and targeted promotion of Slovenia in the US market, is a joint project of the Government Communications Office, Ljubljana Tourism, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.

Dolphin centre to open in Piran in mid-June,"Morigenos, the Slovenian marine mammal association, will open a dolphin centre in Piran on 13 June for visitors to learn about the life of dolphins in an interactive manner and to get to know the marine world in more detail. An important mission will also be raising awareness about the role of science for sea conservation.","The association would like the Dolphin Education and Research Centre to become a meeting point of science and education on marine mammals, says Tilen Genov, Morigenos's founder and president.

He says the centre is intended for visitors from home and abroad, individuals and organised groups, including schools. It will host workshops and meetings of scientists.

""We'd like to create a centre that offers a new opportunity in terms of science and conservation. After all, it will be a place where young people can spend their spare time doing something useful and fun.""

The centre will feature multimedia content and exhibitions, while visitors will also be able to see a life-size model of a dolphin and parts of a skeleton.

In a sound room, they will get an opportunity to immerse into the sea world and listen to sounds made by animals but also by people.

The project won public and EU funds as part of the strategy of local development in the region of Istria in 2021, but to have the centre the way the association had imagined it, they have launched a fundraiser aiming to raise EUR 5,000 by the end of July.

Morigenos is an organisation that largely consists of volunteers who monitor and study dolphins in Slovenian and surrounding waters. For the past 20 years, their research has been contributing to the understanding and protection of dolphins and the conservation of marine ecosystems.

Looking at its beginnings, Genov said when he received the Prometheus of Science award for excellence in science communication for 2021 that his ambition to monitor dolphins had been met with doubt, as many had argued there were no dolphins in the Slovenian sea. Now the dolphin population in the Gulf of Trieste is one of the most researched ones in the entire Mediterranean Sea.",human interest,"['education', 'science and technology', 'human interest']"
Croatian Speaker Jandroković visiting Slovenia,"National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič will be hosting her Croatian counterpart Gordan Jandroković on Wednesday and Thursday. The official visit will be an opportunity to discuss the development of interparliamentary cooperation, bilateral relations between Slovenia and Croatia, and the situation in the Western Balkans.","In addition to Klakočar Zupančič, Jandroković and his delegation will meet Prime Minister Robert Golob on Wednesday and National Council President Marko Lotrič on Thursday.

Jandroković will also meet heads of deputy groups and chairs of certain committees or commissions in Slovenia's parliament, the National Assembly said.

Efforts to promote economic cooperation between the two countries are on the agenda as well, as are views on topical security and political issues in the international community.

Relations between Slovenia and Croatia are good, but there is an open issue of the implementation of the border arbitration award.

In March, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and Golob agreed on efforts to strengthen cooperation in energy and management of illegal migration while Plenković was visiting Slovenia.

Slovenia celebrates Sovereignty Day,"Slovenia celebrates Sovereignty Day on Wednesday, a national holiday commemorating the day in 1991 when the last soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JLA) left the country, more than three months after ceasefire in Slovenia's ten-day independence war.","The departure of the last JLA soldiers from the port of Koper on 25 October 1991 is considered one of the final steps in the independence efforts, coming after Slovenia declared independence on 25 June, a move that resulted in the war, which saw the JLA trying to stifle resistance from the Slovenian Territorial Defence and the Slovenian police force.

The armed conflict ended on 7 July, with Slovenia agreeing to a three-month moratorium on independence activities as part of the Brijuni Declaration, a ceasefire agreement. The negotiations also featured Croatia - which declared independence alongside Slovenia - and were mediated by the European Community.

Even before the moratorium expired, the Yugoslav authorities realised it would be impossible to keep Slovenia in the federation, and talks on the retreat of JLA soldiers from Slovenia's territory commenced. The final withdrawal was scheduled for 18 October but was delayed by formalities.

Marked for the first time in 2015, Sovereignty Day is a national holiday but not a work-free day. It was declared in order to strengthen the awareness of Slovenia's sovereignty, with ""25 October representing the day when Slovenia not only formally but actually became a sovereign state"".

Every five years a high-profile state ceremony is held in Koper to celebrate the event, with the next one scheduled for 2026, while this year a number of small ceremonies will be organised across the country by the Association of Independence War Veterans and the Sever union of police veteran associations.

The main ceremony will be held on Wednesday evening in Ptuj, with Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar as the keynote speaker. Defence Minister Marjan Šarec will also be in attendance.

President Nataša Pirc Musar's office posted ahead of the event that ""for the president, the departure of the last JLA soldiers symbolises courage, rebellion, victory, and the freedom of the Slovenian people that had been secured by fight"".","unrest, conflicts and war",['lifestyle and leisure']
Paper calls for a sea change in spatial planning,Primorske Novice urges the authorities in Wednesday's commentary to fundamentally change spatial planning in the aftermath of the massive floods. It says that adaptation to extreme weather is unavoidable and that prevention is better than having to deal with the consequences.,"""When he visited the Savinja Valley, the minister of natural resources and spatial planning tellingly said that in future 'we must see where we site and build, learn the lesson and give the water space'. These words must be followed by actions,"" says the commentary Water Lessons.

When the rebuilding starts in earnest, Slovenia must opt for different solutions that will be neither popular nor cheap. Infrastructure must comply with different standards of climate safety.

""It is time for a sea change in spatial planning that seriously considers flood safety - or the lack thereof. It has now become clear what the consequences are if we do not spend enough money on water infrastructure and flood mitigation.""",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'human interest']"
Climate activists in Ljubljana warn of the severity of climate crisis,Greenpeace activists staged a performance in Ljubljana's Prešeren Square on Saturday entitled the Earth Is on Fire as part of which they burned a several-metre Earth model to warn decision-makers that climate crisis should be taken seriously.,"The NGO also launched a campaign Climate Crime, during which individuals will be highlighted who showed with their actions, statements or intentions in the last year that they do not take the climate crisis seriously, Greenpeace said in a press release.

A vote on the nominees will be held online until 16 April and the ""winner"" will be announced on 22 April, Earth Day.

According to Greenpeace activist Sara Kosirnik, the NGO would like the campaign to open debate and raise awareness of the fact that some actions are inadmissible.

Global temperature is set to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius in the first half of next decade compared to pre-industrial times, the mid-19th century. This is expected to increase the severity of climate change impacts in the near future, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report last week.

The reality is worrying, but hope remains provided governments act now, Greenpeace said in response to the report. The only way forward is an energy transition, the organisation said.",environmental issue,['environmental issue']
Golob talks APCs with Poland's Duda as well,"Prime Minister Robert Golob met Polish President Andrzej Duda on the sidelines of the NATO summit on Wednesday to also discuss the option of Slovenia buying Poland's Rosomak armoured vehicles. Golob, who also broached Slovenia's APC purchase plans with the Finnish president on Tuesday, called for a competitive offer.","Addressing the press at end of the two-day meeting in Vilnius, Golob said ""we have reiterated our call on the Polish authorities to ensure that their bidder makes the best or most competitive offer"".

""After all, the Rosomak armoured vehicles with which the Polish army is equipped have proved to be among the most reliable armoured vehicles in past operations. That is why they are also interesting to the Slovenian Armed Forces,"" he said as in connection to Slovenia's plans to purchase APCs after the country withdrew from a deal with the OCCAR to buy eight-wheeled Boxers.

Just as he did after his talks with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on Tuesday, Golob stressed that the government is only discussing this with other governments, not directly with manufacturers or intermediaries.

Increasing defence spending was one of the central themes of the meeting of NATO leaders in the Lithuanian capital. They confirmed a new commitment on defence spending, under which 2% of GDP will be the lower limit and no longer the ceiling.

They also endorsed new regional defence plans for the northern, the central, and southern region, of which Slovenia is a part. Golob expressed his satisfaction that the defence plans, especially for the south, do not only cover Europe, but also the global south, i.e. Africa, as well as the fight against terrorism.

Meanwhile, Defence Minister Marjan Šarec today attended an informal meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of Defence Ministers where he hailed the approval of the historic package of defence plans to enhance the alliance's collective defence. He pledged for Slovenia to shoulder its share of the burden.

He noted the importance of the Western Balkans and the need to monitor the security situation and to be ready to maintain peace and stability.

On the sidelines, Šarec met Phillip Lavigne, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. They focused on the organisation of the NATO Innovation Challenge to be hosted by Slovenia in the autumn together with the Allied Command Transformation.

The aim will be to stimulate discussion on best practices for crisis response. The event will also provide an excellent opportunity for cooperation and raise the profile of Slovenian academia and research, and Slovenian companies, according to a release from the PM's office.

Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon attended the Leadership Matters meeting of women leaders, hosted by Irene Fellin, NATO secretary general's special representative for women, peace and security.

""We need more women in positions of responsibility. Those of us who have the privilege to be involved in decision-making, need to make it possible for other women to do the same,"" Fajon was quoted as saying.

She pointed in particular to the suffering but courageous women in Ukraine, who are not giving up. ""We must empower them to co-decide on the future of post-war Ukraine,"" Fajon said, outlining Slovenia's efforts on the Women, Peace and Security Agenda within NATO to the ministers.",politics,"['politics', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"
SDS wants accelerated timeline for Krško 2,"The Democrats (SDS) demand that the government speed up procedures related to the expansion of the Krško nuclear power plant. In a motion for an emergency session of two parliamentary committees, the opposition party says the government should make it clear whether nuclear has a future in Slovenia.","""The SDS endeavours to speed up construction of Krško 2, which enjoys broad public support. And yet, activities related to Krško 2 are proceeding too slowly,"" it said on Wednesday.

While the prime minister recently said Krško 2 could be built by 2037 or 2038 according to the most optimistic scenario, the party says Slovenia will face reduced reliance on domestic electricity before that as the coal plant in Šoštanj shuts down in 2033 and Krško 1 might have to be wound down as well unless it operating permit is extended again.

""We have to realise that without nuclear the transition to a carbon-free society will be longer and more difficult. Any delays concerning Krško 2 are damaging,"" the party said, adding that ""there should be no dilemmas concerning the acceleration of the Krško 2 timeline"".",politics,"['politics', 'environmental issue']"
Changes to RTV act discussed at EU Parliament round table,"Slovenian MEP Romana Tomc (EPP/SDS) hosted a round table at the European Parliament on Thursday to discuss the independence of media, which is at the centre of the European Commission's proposal for a European media freedom act. One of the main topics were the changes to the RTV act, currently awaiting a decision by the Constitutional Court.","The European media freedom act will for the first time enter into EU legislation the provision that governments are not allowed to interfere in the work of media, said Marie Frenay, member of the Cabinet of Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova.

The act would have national authorities choose objective criteria with which to name the management of public media, while the financing of public media would be transparent and predictable, said Frenay. The act will increase the transparency concerning media ownership, she added.

Peter Gregorčič, the president of the RTV Slovenija programme council, said that when drafting the changes to the RTV act the Slovenian government did not respect the objectives regarding the independence of public media set in the European media freedom act.

Gregorčič said that if the authorities in a country can end the terms of managing and monitoring bodies in public media without meeting the established conditions, the bodies lose their autonomy and responsibility. The bodies, which are the only guarantee of plural and independent information, are thus exposed to the distribution of political power of their founder, the country, Gregorčič added.

He and former editor-in-chief of the news portal Siol Peter Jančič were critical of the fact that European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova met with Constitutional Court president Matej Accetto when she visited Slovenia last week, as the court is currently deciding on the constitutionality of the changes to the RTV act.

Jourova already assured that she did not discuss the changes to the RTV act with Accetto during her visit, but rather the independence of the judiciary, said Frenay.

Jančič said that ""the European Commission is sometimes very curt in its politics and does not solve actual problems,"" adding that it solves ""relatively marginal problems"", using tools such as the media freedom act.

Former journalist Miro Petek said that the problem of media freedom in Slovenia ""lies in the media monopoly and the exploitation of legislation,"" adding that journalists are getting laid off as a consequence.","crime, law and justice","['politics', 'crime, law and justice']"

"Idea of orderly public finances dead, Delo says of new EU fiscal rules","Commenting on the European Commission's proposals for the long-awaited new economic governance rules, the newspaper Delo says in Friday's front-page commentary that this marks the end of an era as the EU tries to mend gaps in its monetary union and address the members' increasing debts.","""There will be no more belt-tightening, which would push a country in financial and economic distress into an even more difficult position,"" the commentary says, adding that provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact passed in the 1990s, before the common currency was introduced, often remained a dead letter.

Two decades ago, the EU failed to monitor infringements by strong member states, such as Germany and France. Then the debt crisis came, hitting Greece and other member states hard, and revealing construction errors in the monetary union.

Now, Brussels' new mantra is that in the future, reducing excessive deficits and debt will be tailored to each country. The Commission is tired of accusations that it is dictating the fiscal policies, budgetary cuts and the implementation of fiscal reforms of EU member states, Delo says.

It will be up to each country to take the responsibility for adopting the measures needed. ""The strain jacket put on public finances should not hold a country back in investing into digitalization and the green transition,"" the commentary adds.

With the new proposals, it will be even easier for Brussels to cut slack to member states. In a monetary union where the currency is shared by countries with different budget cultures, sticking to a one-size-fits-all model cannot work anyway, Delo says under the headline A Quiet Farewell of the Austerity Pact.

The notion that the common currency can be successful only if the public purses of member states are in order is indeed dead, the commentary concludes.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'politics']"

Dnevnik says Golob and Mesec failed to show maturity,Dnevnik is critical of changes to the labour legislation passed by the National Assembly last week despite strong opposition by employers. It says in Monday's commentary that Prime Minister Robert Golob and Labour Minister Luka Mesec displayed a lack of political maturity. The latter by pushing ahead and the former by not dismissing him for it.,"Under the headline Good, Bad and Worse News, the paper says that the passage of the changes was good news because they brought some good solutions. But the changes were not agreed on by the social partners, with employers strongly against some provisions.

The fact that a piece of labour legislation that had not been agreed on by social partners was passed in parliament is a precedent, the paper says. The last time such a scenario was looming was in 2015. But the then Prime Minister Janez Janša insisted on social dialogue and dismissed the labour minister.

Now Golob and Mesec failed to show political maturity displayed by their greatest political opponent. ""This is bad news,"" the paper says, noting that Mesec failed to respond successfully to the employers' decision to leave the negotiations in the summer.

""The fact that he remained minister is yet more proof of the lack of political wisdom in the prime ministers' office,"" Dnevnik says.

The changes failed to even touch on a number of much-needed reforms. The minister is promising a new round of talks, but it is uncertain whether employers will return to the table.

Moreover, Mesec is only talking about solutions that are on the ministry's and the unions' list of wishes and it is hard to imagine that there could be a reasonable outcome.

""But there is also an alternative scenario. One in which the Golob government will not be changing the legislation because an early election will be called .... There is no need for additional explanation why this would very likely be even worse news.""",labour,"['labour', 'politics']"
Dnevnik says Zelensky played his cards wrong in grain dispute,"The newspaper Dnevnik notes on Monday that Ukraine could soon have three aid-sceptical countries right next to its western border, arguing that its President Volodymyr Zelensky has played his cards wrong in the grain dispute with Poland.","One of the current challenges for Ukraine is the pre-election situation in the US, Poland and Slovakia, and it is not to be ruled out that this could go on after the individual elections in these countries. Neither is it to be ruled out that it could happen in other countries as well.

""The unilateral embargo on Ukrainian grain is clearly an election campaign move and a way to recruit farmers' support,"" says the paper, adding that the escalation of the dispute in the form of Poland's end to arms transfers to Ukraine indicates an assessment that this would be to the liking of many voters.

Slovakia will hold a general election this Saturday, and ratings are looking good for former Prime Minister Robert Fico, whose one of the main promises is to withdraw support for Ukraine.

If the ruling party in Poland and Fico's party in Slovakia win in the coming elections and form the government, ""Ukraine will have three aid-sceptical countries (also Hungary) on its western border, hence in the heart of central Europe"", whose bulwark against Russia Ukraine is supposed to be.

This outcome is not set in stone, but another problem for Ukraine is the situation in the US, where the two main parties have a hard time agreeing on anything and some politicians attempt to present aid for Ukraine as putting its safety above the safety of the US or above migration issues there.

Zelensky and his public appearances have been one of Ukraine's aces since the start of the war, but he played his cards wrong when it comes to the grain dispute.

Angrily singling out countries that have been helping otherwise was unnecessary, and there was no rush to file a lawsuit at the World Trade Organisation.

It is possible to understand him in light of the war, but Zelensky is not just a military commander, he is also a politician with sufficient international experience under his belt to understand ""the countries' internal dynamics"".

He could have avoided this outcome, also because it benefits Russia, which now has even less reason to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative, says the commentary Cannons and Grain.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'politics']"

UKC Ljubljana neurosurgery head resigns over personal fee,"Neurosurgeon Marko Bošnjak has resigned as head of neurology at the UKC Ljubljana hospital following a report he had charged a personal fee of EUR 6,000 to a patient from abroad that he operated on at UKC Ljubljana earlier this year.","UKC Ljubljana director general Marko Jug told the press on Friday that Bošnjak remains a surgeon at the hospital. In his resignation letter, Bošnjak said he was resigning because he did not want to harm the reputation of UKC Ljubljana. Jug said that the case opened a debate about a grey zone of medical consults.

Since the news report was aired on Wednesday evening, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) opened an investigation into the matter. Its investigators visited UKC Ljubljana yesterday and the hospital intends to hand over all relevant documents, Jug said.

The commercial broadcaster POP TV reported that Bošnjak had operated on a woman from North Macedonia, who paid the full price of the operation, some EUR 27,000, to UKC Ljubljana, but she also had to pay another EUR 6,000 to Bošnjak personally through an agency in Hong Kong.

POP TV started investigating after it received email correspondence between Bošnjak and the patient's family. Bošnjak sent the EUR 27,000 invoice for the surgery, bearing UKC Ljubljana's logo, from his private email account. This invoice and the personal fee were both paid on 18 January.

Bošnjak told POP TV that the family had reached out to him because they had heard of his good work and expertise. He said that he had reviewed the patient's medical records in his spare time and that the family offered to compensate him for his work. However, POP TV said the correspondence showed Bošnjak had been the one to bring up compensation.

He told the broadcaster that he had directed the family to an agency in Hong Kong that promoted his name and that the fee had been paid to the agency in Hong Kong for tax reasons. He also said it covered his annual ""membership"" of the agency.",labour,"['labour', 'health']"
65 authors featured at Frankfurt fair under slogan Honeycomb of Words (feature),Slovenia will feature 65 writers as the guest of honour at the 2023 Frankfurt Book Fair from 18 to 22 October. The country will organise 100 events at its pavilion and stall plus another 100 at 22 venues around Frankfurt.,"However, literary events will not be limited either to the fair or Frankfurt, as many will take place in other German towns as well as in Austria, but also in Slovenia, where they already started some time ago.

Priding itself as a country of beekeeping, Slovenia will present its literary gems and culture to global readers and publishers under the slogan Honeycomb of Words.

Curator Miha Kovač said at Wednesday's press conference that Slovenia would like to highlight its special geographical location where various cultures meet and the fact that global phenomena Laibach and Slavoj Žižek are merely the tip of the ice berg under which there is ""plenty of extremely good and interesting cultural products"".

Among the selected authors are 34 women and 31 men whose works have been translated over the past two years. Slovenia will thus be only the third guest country in Frankfurt to feature more women writers than man, said Kovač, one of the three curators alongside translators Amalija Maček and Matthis Göritz.

Some of them will be highlighted at the pavilion, foremost those with the largest number of German or other translations, including philosopher Slavoj Žižek and writers Evald Flisar, Drago Jančar, Goran Vojnović, Aleš Šteger, Lila Prap, to name but a few.

Slovenian ethnic minority writers from Italy and Austria are also on List 65, including Dušan Jelinčič, Florjan Lipuš and Maja Haderlap, alongside foreign authors living in Slovenia - Erica Johnson Debeljak and Noah Charney.

Special focus will be on some of the deceased greats, such as Slavko Grum, Srečko Kosovel, Tomaž Šalamun, Maruša Krese and Alma Karlin.

The selection is in line with the fair's practice of inviting German and other publishers to send their translations of Slovenian authors, which are then put on show together with translations into other languages, explained Kovač.

However, apart from these authors, others will take part in the project, either at other book fairs or at various literary events and projects, such as Slovenian poetry vending machines, literary tours and art residencies.

As Slovenian Book Agency director Katja Stergar put it, with all the activities as part the Frankfurt Book Fair, Slovenia is penetrating in various ways into the German cultural space and beyond.

Slovenian poetry and philosophy - quite demanding literary genres with relatively few readers which require attentive reading - are the flagships among the Slovenian works translated into foreign languages.

This is why the country will take the opportunity of the fair to highlight as its special feature deep reading, a topic of much debate in Europe and the US.

The headline event during the fair will be a concert by Slovenian band Laibach with its new project Alamut, based on the acclaimed 1938 novel by Vladimir Bartol. Appearance by UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin is also planned.

The country hopes the fair will be followed by increased translation of Slovenian literature into foreign languages and an awareness of what is needed for Slovenian books to enter foreign markets.

Culture Minister Asta Vrečko said Slovenia would present itself at the fair far beyond the parameters of a book fair, as an open country located at the meeting point of cultures oriented towards sustainability and solidarity.

Frankfurt Book Fair director Juergen Boos said Slovenia's preparations for the fair were running as the organisers wish, and pointed to what distinguishes Slovenia, from cuisine to sport and its geographical position.

Among the authors he singled out poet Srečko Kosovel (1904-1926), and contemporary novelist Drago Jančar, whom he labelled as his favourite author.

Architect Jure Sadar presented some details about the pavilion, which he designed, saying the country's slogan could be understand as integration, an exchange of ideas in the fields of knowledge, literature and culture.

The pavilion consists of the main area, which will also feature the Books of Slovenia exhibition of German translations, and of two smaller venues.

These will serve for various presentations and talks, while there will also be a cafe with a small stage for concerts and culinary events.

The book shelves in the main area will serve to highlight certain authors while also featuring digital content and works of art, Sader said.

The country's preparations for the fair began in 2016 when German publishers started making study trips to Slovenia. The project will cost the country seven million euros, provided by the Culture Ministry.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment']"
Govt to present bill on public sector pay system reform in coming days,"The government will be presenting to trade unions a bill on a new pay system for the public sector in the coming days, Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik said on Monday, after presenting to the unions changes to the negotiations guidelines, including a gradual roll-out of the new system, which the unions have criticised.","The government initially planned to present the pay system reform bill by mid-March, but the document is currently still in interdepartmental coordination, Ajanović Hovnik told the press after meeting public sector unionists today.

Before the bill is sent to the unions, it will also have to be okayed by the government. Nevertheless, trade unionists can expect to have it on their desks in the coming days. Moreover, the government intends to send to unions a proposal on eliminating pay disparities within the existing system.

After the proposals are presented, the talks will become more intensive, with government and union reps meeting twice a week to discuss the bill and once a week to address disparities by field. These field-specific negotiations will also address ""all other elements that affect pay policy, including titles and various bonuses"", the minister said.

The unions' negotiating group headed by Jakob Počivavšek partly understands the need for gradual introduction of the new system, but Počivavšek said that the dynamic is up for discussion and will likely depend on concrete proposals.

He believes the biggest problem is the delay of the overhaul of the lowest pay brackets to 2025. He is also somewhat sceptical that the two sides will be able to finish negotiations by the end of June, as agreed in October.

Ajanović Hovnik believes the timelines could be honoured if there is will on both sides to ""build a healthy foundation for the pay system"". ""At the end of the day, a consensus and good solutions for the next 10 or 15 years are more important than the date of 30 June,"" the minister underlined.

She moreover commented on the plan of Fides, the trade union of doctors and dentists, to go on strike unless a planned pay tier for their field is set up by 1 April. Ajanović Hovnik does not believe the union will have the grounds to strike. ""The tier in itself means nothing unless it is in the context of the bill, which is being coordinated with other unions with the deadline being 30 June.""

The unions have not yet received an estimate of financial effects and the minister did not want to talk about it today. Moreover, the two sides did not sign a statement about all elements of the pay reform being on the table, which was announced by Ajanović Hovnik last week.",labour,"['labour', 'social issue']"

Ministry pledges sufficient support to municipal housing funds,Officials of the Ministry for Solidarity-Based Future committed to adequate funding for the construction of much needed public rental housing as they met with representatives of municipal housing funds on Monday.,"""Our first commitment is to ensure a sufficient funding for construction, so I'm pleased to announce that starting this year, EUR 50 million will be available from the Recovery and Resilience Plan, along with an additional EUR 25.5 million from the budget,"" Minister Simon Maljevac told the press on the sidelines of a joint meeting held after visits to individual municipal funds and other organisations in this field were paid in recent months.

""We will continue this trend in the coming years,"" he added, explaining today's discussion would also serve as a basis for needed legislative changes ""to ensure smoother operations in the field.""

""Our plans are clear: to ensure the construction of as many homes as possible by 2026, the target being 5,000 units. From 2026 onward, the goal is a system that operates with an annual budget of EUR 100 million,"" said Maljevac.

Regional housing organisations were visited to gain insights into the on-the-ground situation, ""as we want to address local circumstances and specificities"". ""It is crucial for the ministry to establish connections and bring stability to the system, so I believe that today is the first step in that direction,"" he added, expressing the wish for meetings like this to take place at least twice a year.

The shortage of housing is practically ubiquitous. ""Due to the lack of housing policy over the past 30 years, housing funds have been left to their own devices, doing their best to address the situation. So we can be grateful to them for preventing the situation from deteriorating further,"" said the minister.

It was established that all generations are affected, with young people often bearing the brunt. There is also lack of appropriate data on the specific needs of different groups of people and regions, as well as acceptable rental rates.

The bill is to give priority to digital services such as electronic delivery and signing of documents, she said.","Implementing the 'digital first' principle, the new law will make sure that ""nobody will ask you to sign a document by hand any more but a digital signature will fully suffice"", the minister told the press.

E-signature is enough even under the current legislation but some still demand meetings in person or documents sent by regular mail, she said. The new law will enable documents to be safely delivered digitally, she stressed.

The draft bill is ready and will be finalised during the summer before it is sent to ministries for discussion. It is not clear when the bill could be passed, but Stojmenova Duh hopes it will be this year.

The minister also pointed to the European Chips Act, which aims to strengthen the EU's role in the production of computer chips. The EU is currently producing around 10-12% of all chips, but wants to raise this share to at least 20% in the coming years. The EU will spend more than EUR 40 billion to support this industry, and member states are also expected to invest in this field.

In Slovenia, the ministries of digital transformation, higher education, science and innovation, and economy, tourism and sport have joined forces with the Chip.SI Competence Centre, which brings together Slovenian research organisations and companies.

Together, they presented their plans, including funding, to the European Commission. ""The ministries will provide the funds ourselves within the possibilities we have in our budgets, and we will also help the competence centre to access EU funding,"" Stojmenova Duh said.

The ministries have also been successfully cooperating with Austrian counterparts. Several Austrian companies produce chips, while Slovenian companies are very good at designing and developing them.

The Ministry for Digital Transformation also plans to set up 222 Digi Info points around the country to offer support to citizens in using digital services.

A computer equipment renting scheme, envisaged by the changes to the Promotion of Digital Inclusion Act, is to be introduced this year.",education,"['crime, law and justice', 'politics', 'economy, business and finance']"

Boštjan Poklukar nominated for new interior minister,"Prime Minister Robert Golob has nominated Boštjan Poklukar for new minister of the interior, to replace Tatjana Bobnar, who resigned in December, the National Assembly confirmed for the STA on Monday. Poklukar already held this position in the government of Marjan Šarec (2018-2020).","Poklukar now awaits a hearing before the relevant parliamentary committee. If his bid is later endorsed by parliament, he will take over at the Interior Ministry once again, replacing Bobnar, who stepped down last December citing political meddling in the police force, an allegation which the government has dismissed.

Previously, Bobnar was appointed police commissioner during Poklukar's first term as interior minister from September 2018 to March 2020.

Holding a master's degree in public administration sciences, Poklukar used to be a member of the Marjan Šarec List (LMŠ), a party that was merged into the current ruling party Freedom Movement last year, so now he is a member of the prime minister's party.

Since 1991, he has been employed by the Defence Ministry and he is a member of the Slovenian Armed Forces, where he has served in various capacities. He was awarded the Bronze Medal of General Maister and the Silver Medal of the Slovenian Armed Forces, and he was also honoured as a veteran of the war for Slovenian independence.

He has worked for the Defence Ministry's Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, where he was the head of the Kranj Regional Information Centre. He also served as the administration's public relations officer responsible for migration and during this time he was actively involved in efforts to tackle the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016.

The issue of migration was also one of the priorities of his first term at the helm of the Interior Ministry.

Since June last year, he has been head of the Defence Ministry's Administration for Military Heritage.

The nomination comes after several NGOs wrote to Prime Minister Golob to take into account that the Interior Ministry was a key institution for people's security and prosecution of crime and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Katarina Bervar Sternad, the head of the Legal-Information centre for NGOs, told newspaper Dnevnik that Poklukar was one of the ministers who had listened but dialogue with him had not yielded any results.

Cinkarna Celje shareholders decide against dividend payout,"The shareholders of the chemical company Cinkarna Celje decided on Wednesday to carry over EUR 25 million in undistributed profit. The AGM voted down three dividend payout proposals, ultimately following the management's proposal. The company has received energy crisis state aid, meaning it cannot pay out dividends without being fined.","The management said in April that a dividend payout was not planned. If the company paid out even a part of the profit this year, it would have to repay the aid with interest.

Meanwhile, two small shareholder associations and Envestor, a company, each submitted their own counter proposals, all of which were voted down.

The Pan-Slovenian Small Shareholders' Association (VZMD) proposed EUR 23.4 million or EUR 3 gross a share be paid out in 2024. Small Shareholders of Slovenia (MDS) proposed a payout of EUR 21.69 million or EUR 2.776 apiece and reserving EUR 3.05 million to repay the state aid. Envestor wanted a payout of EUR 25 million or EUR 3.2 in 2024.

VZMD issued a press release saying the decision was ""yet another serious and damaging step backwards in the attitude toward investors and in the shareholder and corporate management culture"".

On the other hand, the management welcomed the outcome. ""Our competition has several plants outside Europe, where electricity and natural gas are significantly cheaper,"" CEO Aleš Skok said.

He added that estimates showed Cinkarna was to receive between EUR 5 million and EUR 7 million in state aid this year to mitigate the effects of the energy crisis.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Pirc Musar meets minority ahead of visit to Italy,"President Nataša Pirc Musar met on Monday with representatives of the Slovenian minority in Italy to discuss the current challenges they face, before she heads to Italy to meet with her counterpart Sergio Mattarella.","The talks revolved around efforts to guarantee seats to minority representatives in the Italian parliament. Ever since Italy adopted a constitutional reform cutting the number of MPs and senators, chances of ethnic Slovenians securing a seat are slimmer, the minority representatives said.

Discussing topical issues with the president were Senator Tatjana Rojc, a member of the Slovenian minority, Ksenija Dobrila, head of the Slovenian Cultural and Economic Union, Marko Jarc, the chair of the parity committee on Slovenian minority matters, and regional councillor Marko Pisani, the president's office said.

Pirc Musar pledged her continuous support to the European Capital of Culture 2025 cross-border project hosted by Slovenia's Nova Gorica and Italy's Gorizia, hopeful that the Slovenian minority in Italy as well as the Italian minority in Slovenia will, as much as possible, seize the opportunities the project has to offer.

""I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Slovenian ethnic minority in Italy for their dedicated work. Their participation in public life is key for a democratic society,"" Pirc Musar said.

The president also held talks with representatives of the Italian minority in Slovenian, MP Felice Žiža and the head of the Coastal Self-Government Community Alberto Scheriani. They touched on challenges for the economy and education, and support for the minority's media outlets.

The talks were an introduction to Pirc Musar's working visit to Italy, which she starts on Friday. She will meet with Mattarella in Rome, pay a visit to Slovenian troops in Naples and have an audience with Pope Francis in Vatican.",politics,"['politics', 'social issue']"
13th EuroBiotech biotechnology congress opens in Ljubljana,"The 13th EuroBiotech opened in Ljubljana on Wednesday as the Slovenian capital is hosting the biotechnology congress for the first time. The three-day event will see experts discuss progress and challenges of various fields of biotechnology, which is also rapidly developing in Slovenia.","Polona Žnidaršič Plazl of the Ljubljana Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, the organiser of EuroBiotech 2023, said ahead of the event that biotechnology was a promising field that addressed key challenges such as food, health, environment and energy.

Slovenian and foreign experts will thus discuss various fields of biotechnology, such as medical, food, agricultural, environmental, industrial, marine and water biotechnology, and talk about biocatalytic processes (biocatalysis).

As the event opened, Helena Prosen, vice-dean of the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, told the participants that biotechnology was developing rapidly and was considered to have very good future prospects also in Slovenia.

She singled out the pharmaceutical industry in particular as a progressive and recognisable field in Slovenia in which biotechnology is present.

""Pharmaceutical companies have definitely recognised the value of biotechnological processes and are developing them at an accelerated pace to produce medications,"" Prosen noted.

She added that there were many small companies in Slovenia that were active in this field, but have not yet managed to place their products in the market.

Maja Ravnikar, the director of the National Institute of Biology, sees the congress as an opportunity to raise awareness among stakeholders about biotechnology having high added value that ""needs to be cultivated in order to develop the economy"".

Roman Jerala, a biochemist and researcher at the Institute of Chemistry, said in his opening address that there was a lack of properly qualified staff in the pharmaceutical industry. He called for measures to make young people enthusiastic about it.

Jerala told the STA that the pharmaceutical industry was not the only well-developed field in Slovenia. ""Biotechnology is also developing well in medicine, especially in terms of cancer immunotherapy and treatment of genetic diseases,"" he said.

He expects even greater progress in biotechnology in Slovenia in the next five to ten years. ""Technologies such as machine learning, mRNA and others are being increasingly applied, which will enable more accessible treatment for patients.""

The National Council of Carinthian Slovenians (NSKS), another minority umbrella in Carinthia, wrote that it is paying close attention to the coalition negotiations on the new regional government and expressed an expectation that Carinthian Slovenians will be included in its programme.

Carinthia Governor Peter Kaiser (SPÖ) and Martin Gruber (ÖVP) said on Friday that the two parties will continue to work together and will form a coalition for the next five years.

The SPÖ won the regional election with 38.9% votes, which is a significant drop from the 48% it received five years ago. The Freedom Party (FPÖ) came in second with 24.5% of the votes, followed by the ÖVP with 17% and Team Kärnten with 10.1%.

Electricity price cap in 2024 for 90% of household consumption,"The government will continue to regulate electricity prices for households in 2024 but the current cap will apply only to 90% of their consumption, Minister Bojan Kumer, who is in charge of energy, told the STA on Wednesday. Gas prices and electricity prices for other consumers will no longer be capped.","Retail prices of electricity for households, small commercial consumers, protected consumers and small and medium-sized companies are capped until the end of the year.

Taking into account that VAT on energy products for heating returned to the higher level in June and that the contribution for electricity from renewable sources is charged again, electricity prices per average household consumer would rise by 30% in January on December when the cap expired.

However, the government has decided to extend the cap where it will also make a step toward phasing out regulation and encouraging households to save on energy.

Thus the price valid now will apply to 90% of the consumption and market prices will be charged for the remaining 10%. Both prices will be listed separately on the electricity bill.

A simulation at current prices shows the bill per average consumer, consuming 4,035 MWh a year of which 45% at higher and 55% at lower tariff, will go up by 3.7%, from EUR 70.3 in September to EUR 73 in January.

The regulated prices will apply to households and electricity consumed in communal areas of multi-apartment or multi-apartment and commercial buildings.

The decree on the regulation was endorsed by the relevant cabinet committee on Tuesday and is expected to be adopted by the government on 19 October.

The government will compensate suppliers for the difference between the regulated and market prices, which is expected to cost the budget EUR 29-36 million in 2024.

A total of EUR 350 million has been earmarked for all measures to mitigate high energy prices this year and the next, but Kumer said that at least EUR 40 million less would in fact be needed.

Prices will no longer be capped for other consumers. The EU framework for aid for businesses expired in May and companies had been urged to buy electricity for 2024 and going forward.

Kumer said that at current prices the price for a three-year purchase of electricity would be just slightly higher than the capped price.

Natural gas prices will also ceased to be capped. ""The situation on the market is different than last year, the stockpiles are full, the reliability of supply is much better and we don't see unpredictability during winter either,"" he said.

He expects market prices to be 10-15% lower than the regulated prices. The price for household consumers is capped at EUR 73 per MWh, and the new price could be below EUR 60 per MWh.

""We're counting on additional reductions during the year or after the end of the season and we don't see any need for capping prices for the time being,"" the minister said.

""However, if suppliers abused or raised prices due to potentially less competition on the market, the government will definitely cap prices,"" he added.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'social issue']"

Day of remembrance for victims of communism cancelled (adds),"Just hours before Slovenia was due to mark National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Communism, the government revoked late on Tuesday a decree by its predecessors that created the memorial day with the argument that it was declared without a ""public and expert debate"".","The national memorial day was created by the Janez Janša government by decree on 12 May 2022, when the previous government was already in caretaker capacity, and just days before its term ended and the Robert Golob government was sworn in.

The reasoning at the time was that communist violence left thousands of dead on Slovenian soil between 1941 and 1946, while affecting hundreds of thousands more in the subsequent decades of communist rule.

The date was picked in memory of the killing of 49 people, including 44 Roma, in the Iška Gorge, south of Ljubljana, in 1942.

The declaration of the memorial day was met with criticism by the left, which argued at the time that the underlying desire was to embroil the nation in an endless culture war.

The decision by the current government was expected given that the Social Democrats (SD), the junior coalition partners, said last week that the decree should be repealed since it is ""mostly about revisionism and does nothing to reconcile the people.""

Janša described the decision on Twitter as ""one of the most abhorrent and disgraceful acts in the history of independent Slovenia"" and an ""insult to all those who have at least a shred of sympathy for fellow humans.""

He accused the government of rehabilitating communist crimes and annulling ""exceptional reconciliation efforts by a generation that made Slovenia democratic and independent.""

The government is ""once again ready to fill pits and mining shafts with those who think differently,"" he said in a reference to mass graves of opponents of communism who were killed after the Second World War.

Matej Tonin, head of the Christian democratic New Slovenia (NSi) wrote on Twitter that many people alive today had suffered under communism and many lost their loved ones.

He feels this is not about being on the right side of history, it is about fundamental values and respect for the dead. ""Alas, the current government is not capable of such broad-mindedness.""","crime, law and justice","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'crime, law and justice', 'social issue']"

Dnevnik disappointed by legislation on recording of working time,"Commenting on the passage of the changes to labour legislation that aim to curb violations of working hours provisions by introducing recording of additional data on working hours, the newspaper Dnevnik says on Monday that many concessions were made to appease employers, which watered down the proposal and made it less effective.","Inspections show that violations of workers' rights concerning working time are still frequent, especially in industries where there is not enough workers such as the construction and the hospitality sector.

Recording arrival and departure, breaks and work in special conditions would be welcome, but remarks are also justified as to whether there should be a distinction between jobs where this is urgently needed and where employees have more autonomy in picking where and when they do the work.

A major slip by the coalition was to first say that only higher education professors and researchers would be exempt from the new rules. Trade unions, employers and law experts justifiably protested.

""Time will tell whether or not it will be possible to implement the law that now envisages no exceptions, but we can already say that it is problematic that employers will be able to keep records in writing or electronically.""

Originally, electronic records were to be obligatory for all, but the ministry led by Luka Mesec, the head of the Left party, agreed to a controversial compromise solution after an outcry of employers, which significantly lowers efficient oversight, as inspectors cannot act against employers who have papers showing that workers worked for eight hours from Monday until Friday.

""Even if it will be more detailed such record keeping will in practice be subject to the same risks and methods of cheating as so far,"" Dnevnik says.

A step forward is only mandatory electronic records of working hours for companies that have been fined for violating labour legislation. ""An important step forward indeed but it would be justifiably expected that this coalition, especially given the parties it consists of, would be more ambitions in protecting workers' rights.""",labour,['labour']

Commentator sees reshuffle as attempt to defuse tensions,"The coming government reshuffle is an attempt by Prime Minister Robert Golob to defuse political and social tensions, political analyst Tanja Starič told the STA after Golob nominated a new health minister and it was revealed two ministers are likely on the way out.","The political developments are turbulent but not unexpected given that the government's problems started before the summer, but these problems were then pushed to the background by the flooding, she said.

Neither is it unexpected that the opposition has decided to initiate an ouster motion against Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik given new revelations that have put her in a ""complex and difficult position,"" according to Starič.

The biggest problem for Golob concerning Ajanović Hovnik is that she is the chief negotiator with trade unions, where a billion euros is at stake. ""If the prime minister replaced a key minister in the final phase of negotiations, this is a big problem for him,"" Starič said.

Coupled with criticism that the post-flood reconstruction has been sluggish, Golob had no other chance but to opt for a government reshuffle, which will redirect public attention to other ministers.

""The fact is, however, that the prime minister has targeted his ministers. These are not ministers whose departure would complicate relations in the coalition,"" she said.

President calls for reform of UN,"A country being discussed in the Security Council or at the UN General Assembly should not have the right to vote or veto, said President Nataša Pirc Musar in an interview with the Austrian news agency APA on the sidelines of the European Forum Alpbach. She also believes that an African country should have a permanent seat in the UNSC.","""When as the aggressor you are sitting at the table in a debate, you should not have the right to vote on what the rest of the world has to say. I am convinced of that,"" the president stressed, saying that this would be ethically just.

She said that after the Second World War, the international community did not expect any of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to start a war. Now the veto power that these countries have must be discussed, she believes.

She pointed out that nothing could be done about the war in Ukraine because Russia will always veto Security Council resolutions and General Assembly resolutions are not binding.

""That is why we need to talk about a reform of the UN"", she said in the light of Slovenia's upcoming membership in the Security Council, while acknowledging this will not be easy.

Pirc Musar also believes a permanent seat on the council should be given to an African country, because 75% of the issues discussed by the body are Africa-related. ""Personally, I would support that because I think they should have a say,"" she said.

She pointed out that, in addition to the war in Ukraine, there are currently more than 30 wars in the world that should not be forgotten. ""We need to tackle conflicts, not just one - even though the war in Ukraine has caused problems all over the world. But it is a big world,"" the president said in the interview published today.

Govt urged to make primary education truly free of charge (adds),A children's charity has called on the authorities to fully enact the right to free primary education as enshrined in the constitution as it noted the various costs related to primary education that the parents have to pay.,"The Ljubljana Moste-Polje Association of Friends of Youth said in a statement on Monday that its humanitarian work with children and families showed that the right enshrined in Article 57 of the constitution was not fully implemented.

It noted that the parents of school children paid the costs of school meals, workbooks and other accessories, and the costs of compulsory optional content such as trips, excursions, shows and similar.

The dances marking the end of primary school are also becoming an increasing cost, the association noted.

""The work and programmes of primary schools should not be financed by parents and students,"" it said, adding that primary schools should charge only the material costs of the activities as part of the non-compulsory optional part of education.

As an example, the association noted outdoor education which are part of the compulsory programme under the primary school act, and should thus be fully covered by the state budget.

The charity has thus proposed amending the article of the organisation and financing of education act that stipulates that education is financed also from ""contributions of students"".

""This would abolish the legal basis in accordance with which primary schools implement programmes and activities and determine the obligation to purchase instructional materials financed from contributions of students and parents.""

The association concluded by saying that the letter addressed to the Education Ministry aimed at realising the commitment from the coalition agreement that public and free education must remain the foundation of solidarity-based society.

The Education Ministry responded by pointing to a number of systemic measures that it believes help ensure equal conditions for all students, regardless of their socio-economic status or other personal circumstances.

It mentioned free borrowing of textbooks, subsidised school meals, co-financing of outdoor education and adjusted programmes for children with special needs, and noted that the extensive network of primary schools ensured that children went to school close to their homes.

As for school meals, the ministry said it supported in principle the proposal to make these meals free of charge, as this issue is planned to be regulated as part of the coalition agreement.

During the second debate, the president focused on the need for joint response to climate change. In this context too, she highlighted the importance of solidarity and mutual help. She also thanked heads of state whose countries helped Slovenia after the devastating floods in early August.

Joint and immediate action is urgent in the face of climate emergencies around the globe, she said. ""Our duty is to act in line with efforts to mitigate climate change and take concrete action to make these aspirations reality.""

In climate action plans one needs to take into account the aspect of protecting human rights and gender equality and involve civil society in the debate. Climate and water security will be among Slovenia's priorities when the country serves as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2024 and 2025, the president said.

Regarding the 2024 European Parliament elections, Pirc Musar talked about disinformation and stressed the importance of the fight against it in order to preserve democratic processes in the EU.

She also expressed support for further efforts to strengthen a unified, solidarity-based, strong and resilient EU and called for the bloc's enlargement to the Western Balkans by 2030.

The Arraiolos Group, named after the first meeting held in 2003 in Arraiolos in Portugal, brings together presidents of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.

This is the first time Pirc Musar attended one of the group's meetings, which serve as an informal platform to discuss the situation in the EU and worldwide and are held once a year.",politics,"['politics', 'environmental issue']"
Photos of everyday life in Spain put on show in Ljubljana,A photo exhibition tracing Spain's non-tangible heritage between 1858 and 1988 will open at the Slovenian Ethnographic Museum (SEM) in Ljubljana on Thursday as part of a cultural programme of Spain's EU presidency.,"Intangible. Heritage and Collective Memory was prepared by the Spanish Culture Ministry, and executed by SEM in collaboration with the Spanish Embassy in Ljubljana.

The exhibition offers an insight into the Spanish collective memory through work, relationships, gestures, images of everyday life, celebrations and professions.

The photos put on show were taken by Jean Laurent, Mariano Moreno, Baltasar Cue, Aurelio de Colmenares y Orgaz, Pedro Ibarra, Eustasio Villanueva Gutierrez, Otto Wunderlich, Antonio Passaporte, Loty, Luis Escobar Lopez, and Cristina Garcia Rodero.

Photographers in Spain were commissioned to document movable and non-movable heritage, such as cathedrals, monasteries, museums or precious items, as early as in the 19th century.

Some of them were also attracted to non-tangible heritage - people and their way of living, an important segment of every culture and as such recognised by UNESCO.

The exhibition also testifies to the ability of photographers to observe everyday life.

Its curators Antonio Munoz Carrion and Maria Pia Timon Tiemblo say that their photos help better understand life in the past, what has been lost, and what has survived and/or changed.

The exhibition will be on until 19 November.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment']"
"Severe storms hit again, tornado develops in Ilirska Bistrica (adds)","Slovenia saw another stormy evening on Tuesday with heavy rainfall and strong winds that once again caused quite a few problems and extensive damage. Strong gusts of wind unroofed buildings and knocked down trees, with a tornado forming near Ilirska Bistrica (SW), damaging 15 buildings.","The cold front entered Slovenia from the north, hitting hard northwest Slovenia in the evening, while storms also caused some issues in the east.

Events that caused damage were reported to the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration from regional centres in Maribor, Postojna, Celje, Koper, Kranj, Murska Sobota, Nova Gorica, Ljubljana, Slovenj Gradec, and Ptuj.

Due to the heavy raining, several basements of buildings were flooded, and many watercourses have swollen. Two landslides were triggered, putting a number of buildings at risk.

A total of 36 firefighting units were on the ground, including three professional units, which responded to 75 incidents.

The firefighters removed the uprooted trees, provided temporary cover to damaged roofs, pumped water out of flooded buildings, secured buildings from flooding with sandbags and secured landslide areas, the administration said.

The heavy rains were accompanied by strong winds, with a tornado developing in the Ilirska Bistrica area in the south-west around 8pm. The rotating column of air lasted for a few minutes, with a local weather station measuring wind speeds of 107 km/h.

The wind speed in the middle of the tornado has been estimated to twice as much, said Sandi Curk, the commander of Civil Protection for the Notranjska region.

The tornado unroofed buildings and knocked down power lines and trees. At least 15 buildings have been damaged, but no one was harmed, said the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration.

According to Civil Protection, two houses were completely unroofed and their residents had to be evacuated. A total of five buildings were severely damaged.

Meteorologist Andrej Velkavrh from the Environment Agency told the STA that ""this is not a common phenomenon [in Slovenia], but it does happen now and then. There was a tornado some 50 years ago that caused a lot of damage from Hotedršica to Vrhnika"".

He also mentioned a tornado that developed in 2008 on the Črnivec pass above Kamnik to destroy a large chunk of forest.

The site of the tornado was visited today by Defence Ministry State Secretary Rudi Medved, who said that the state would cover the costs incurred by the local fire brigades, as was the case with last year's fire in the Kras region.

Luka Špilar of the local Civil Protection unit said that around 40 firefighters were still on the ground, in addition to 25 contractual workers from the civil protection system.

The Kranj Police Department was, meanwhile, notified that a tree had fallen on a tourist train by Lake Bled in the north-west at 6:30pm yesterday. There were four passengers on the train along with the driver, but no one was harmed.

The latest damage comes as the competent services are still dealing with the consequences of the storms from a few days ago.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'environmental issue', 'weather']"
Clocks switched to winter time,"Clocks in Slovenia were turned back by an hour at 3am on Sunday, as the country switched from daylight saving time to winter time to have more light in the morning. Winter time will be in place until 10 March 2024.","Although the general idea is that clock switching allows for better use of natural daylight, the move is becoming increasingly unpopular.

In 2018, the European Commission proposed its abolishment, but member states could not agree on the same time. While some favour winter time, other would like to keep daylight saving time.

"Audit finds some flaws in flood safety projects, minister says","An internal audit into flood safety projects included in the country's Recovery and Resilience Plan has shown some flaws, but they are not such that would jeopardise their implementation, Minister of Natural Resources Uroš Brežan told the press on Wednesday. The flaws will be immediately eliminated, he announced.","The audit was ordered on 31 March over allegations of irregularities and a lack of transparency in selecting the projects for the Recovery and Resilience Plan.

Apart from some administrative flaws, there were some inconsistencies with projects on the middle Sava and the Drava rivers, said Brežan.

The Water Agency will thus take another look at them by 1 August to see if they were not selected because of ""unequal treatment"".

State Secretary Matej Skočir said that the results should be known within a month.

Should any of these projects prove to meet the criteria to be included in the Recovery and Resilience Plan, the agency will seek to conclude contracts with local communities and put the projects in the final selection, said the agency's director Neža Kodre.

The audit, on the other hand, showed no irregularities in the projects for which contracts have already been concluded.

Kodre said that annexes to extend the contracts initially concluded with 34 municipalities in spring 2022 have been concluded with 24 municipalities.

At the end of 2023 when all documents are finalised, all projects will be assessed again to see if they meet all the criteria, she said.

At issue now are building permits, which no municipality managed to obtain by the 30 June deadline, so annexes have been signed to extend the deadline with those municipalities that believe will be able to meet the conditions in the coming months.

Kodre admitted that the timeline is tight, as the deadline to complete the projects under the Recovery and Resilience Plan is 30 June 2026.

Brežan added that with the government's changes to the plan adopted on Monday, the financial framework for flood safety measures is being adjusted.

The ministry proposed to cut the initially planned EUR 310 million in loans and grants to EUR 240 million. Loans were initially planned at EUR 280 million, while now they are at EUR 120 million.

Brežan said that the selected projects will be financed from the Recovery and Resilience Plan, while the ministry will seek alternative sources for the rest of them.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'economy, business and finance']"
Demokracija says NSi working against interests of its voters,"The weekly Demokracija is critical in its latest editorial of cooperation between the opposition Christian Democratic party New Slovenia (NSi) and the left-leaning government, saying that the younger generation of NSi politicians must have forgotten why this party was founded in the first place.","The NSi was founded to prevent a party with Christian values to serve the interests of post-Communist networks and its modern transitional derivates. The founders wanted to represent the interests of the part of the nation (and their descendants) that was systematically persecuted and marginalised in the previous regime.

The new generation of NSi politicians have forgotten that they must serve the interests of their right-leaning voters and not the interests of lobbies and leftist mainstream media and commentators who praise them if they take the role of ""useful idiots"" to serve the needs of the left, the paper says.

""The recent actions of the leadership of this party are unusual, as together with the Freedom Movement and the SD, they are proposing constitutional amendments that reduce the role of the National Assembly and increase the role of the president,"" the paper says, noting that Slovenia has never had a right-leaning president while it has had a right-leaning majority in parliament.

Moreover, by cooperating with the Freedom Movement the NSi undermines serious parliamentary oversight of the ruling left-leaning coalition and Robert Golob's controversial actions in exchange for few well-paid jobs in state-owned and partly state-owned companies.

SDS leader Janez Janša is right in saying that this type of cooperation with the government is even worse than if the NSi joined the government, as this would be more transparent and a lot fairer than this double game.

The fact is that the coalition needs the NSi as an opposition ally to maintain the image of a parliamentary democracy, prevent serious parliamentary oversight, and strengthen long-term efforts to isolate the SDS.

But strategically the most important goal is to implement the key priority of this government, which is to amend the constitution to cement the absolute power of the left in judiciary, demotivate voters in the countryside to vote in election and introduce a semi-presidential system, the paper quotes Janša as saying in the commentary entitled Cementing the Rule of Transitional Left.",politics,['politics']
Slovenia looking for ways to evacuate its citizens from Israel (adds),"The Foreign Ministry has been in contact with 29 Slovenian citizens in Israel. Ten have already left the country, while the ministry is still looking for ways to evacuate the rest, including with the help of other European countries, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said on Monday.","According to the minister, Slovenia is constantly in touch with its citizens in Israel. ""Currently, we have the information that 29 citizens approached us, 10 have already returned, and we are looking for ways to help the rest to return to Slovenia,"" she said on the sidelines of a meeting of the Slovenian-Vietnamese intergovernmental commission on economic cooperation.

The ministry is in talks with ""EU partners and partners in the region"", she said, adding that she was also in talks over the phone with counterparts from Palestine, Israel and Jordan on ensuring a safe return of Slovenian citizens.

The Foreign Ministry said in a press release that Slovenia was not planning to offer own evacuation flights to the citizens. The ten Slovenians who have returned to the country arrived on commercial flights.

Some Slovenian citizens in Israel have not expressed the desire to return to Slovenia, the ministry said, adding that the citizens the ministry was in contact with were not in the most critical spots such as Gaza and the West Bank.

The key priority is for the situation to de-escalate, for ""any kind of violence to be stopped as soon as possible, to prevent any new outbreaks"", Fajon said.

She called for immediate release of hostages, and for negotiations. Intensive diplomatic talks are currently under way and EU foreign ministers will also meet, Fajon noted.

The minister said the two-state solution, which she herself supports, had become a distant goal now. ""But as soon as the situation calms down, we need to actively start tackling the situation and revive the two-state initiative.""

She said that this was also discussed on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York in September.

Currently, the biggest concern is the escalation of the situation in the wider Middle East, she said. ""Intensive diplomatic efforts are under way to stop new outbreaks of violence in the region, especially to prevent a new war in the Middle East.""

""Many see any kind of escalation of tensions in the Middle East as being connected to many things,"" Fajon said, adding that at the moment ""war is all around us"". She pointed to the war in Ukraine, violence in the Middle East, and a potential war in the unstable Western Balkans.

""All these sources of crises, armed conflicts are of great concern"" and as an observer state in the UN Security Council, Slovenia is intensively following the talks, gathering information and is in constant contact with other countries, the minister said.

She again condemned the ""terrorist hateful activity of Hamas"" and the attacks on civilian targets, and expressed her condolences to the relatives of the victims.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war']"
Reporter wonders who rules the country,"The magazine Reporter writes about the powers pulling the strings behind those formally in power in the latest editorial, finding that incumbent Prime Minister Robert Golob has soon realised he will not able to be autonomous as he might have naively thought.","The paper notes that Borut Pahor was the first to hint at ""uncles from behind the scenes"" pulling the strings after his stint as PM more than a decade ago, and now even former PM Miro Cerar talks of influential informal groups.

Compared to Cerar, the paper finds that Golob is playing his political game in a more sovereign way, but not independently; ""the scandal cooked up by (former) Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar was obviously a big lesson to him ... that in exchange for political peace he will have to grant certain concessions to 'uncles from behind the scenes'"".

As examples the paper cites Golob siding with Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković in his row with Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan, his yielding over the military honours granted to former secret police chief Janez Zemljarič at his funeral and the government's support for the merger of the Museum of Slovenian Independence and the Museum of Recent History.

""The Sun King as Golob is named by some people also made tactical concessions to the opposition New Slovenia (NSi) on the other side of the political spectrum,"" the paper writes, noting that some of the party staff remain at supervisory and management boards of state-owned companies because Golob counts on the party's support for constitutional reforms.

PM announces bank tax,"Prime Minister Robert Golob announced late on Monday that a tax on bank assets would be imposed. ""All across Europe, new taxes are being introduced and Slovenia is headed in that direction as well. Most likely in the bill on reconstruction and development, entailing a 0.2% tax for banks,"" he told the public broadcaster TV Slovenija.","""We all know that the banks have in a way been the winners, not of the floods, but of the past few years, also in terms of extreme profits,"" he said by way of responding to speculation how banks would contribute to the reconstruction effort following the worst floods in Slovenia's history.

Appearing in the current affairs show Odmevi, he said that he and Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič had been discussing with managements of banks a way in which they could contribute to the reconstruction.

""At the moment, we see a 0.2% tax on banks' total assets as something that would not undermine the financial sector and also as a fair contribution of the sector to the reconstruction and development of the flood-hit areas,"" he then told the late night news show of commercial broadcaster POP TV.

The government expects to collect EUR 100 million annually and EUR 500 million in five years through this tax, said the prime minister.

All available sources will have to be ""scraped clean"" to ensure enough funds for reconstruction, said Golob, adding that state-owned companies would contribute through a change in dividend policy.

""The gap between EUR 4.7 billion in direct damage and EUR 6.7 billion in the planned reconstruction funds, meaning EUR 2 billion, will be covered by loans."" One of the ways to do it would be long-term treasury bonds, if needed.

He added that the first official damage assessment would be known in the coming days. So far data has been collected from 110 municipalities, meanwhile nearly 70 municipalities have not yet sent the figures, missing the deadline, which was set for 1 September.

""We've extended the deadline, but this really is the latest possible date, to 5 September. We really need the data by then. Only then will we be able to talk about preliminary damage assessments,"" said Golob, adding that the business sector had sent in damage claims worth EUR 340 million.

He underlined the need for transparent use of funds, saying the second batch of emergency legislation would entail a clear obligation that every euro used in flood relief and reconstruction would be public knowledge.

Refugee centre encourages integration through music and play,The Debeli Rtič refugee centre has unveiled a new addition to its playground. The 28 children staying there will be able to pass time by playing an outdoor wooden percussion instrument donated by the International Women's Club Ljubljana (SILA IWCL). Slovenian Philanthropy volunteers expressed gratitude for the gift.,"Last year International Women's Club Ljubljana held a charity concert in Ljubljana that many foreign diplomats attended. They raised funds for Ukrainian refugees and allocated them in agreement with the Slovenian Philanthropy and the government office.

They chose a musical instrument ""to spread the melody of friendship everywhere,"" said SILA IWCL president Lali S. Ilic. The instrument has a wooden frame with many accessories that emit different sounds when tapped.

This will enrich the children's outdoor activities and help them make friends, said Vesna Krošlin Grlj from the Slovenian Philanthropy, who volunteers at the centre daily. Most days they organise games and other activities for children and prepare performances. The children also performed at the presentation of the instrument.

Krošlin Grlj is one of three volunteers that help Ukrainian children in the Ankaran primary school. She noted that the cooperation between the Slovenian Philanthropy and the government office has been perfect.

The municipality of Ankaran ""opened its doors wide, not only for accommodation but also the school, kindergarten and social inclusion of the [refugee] children,"" said Ankaran Mayor Gregor Strmčnik. Currently, 25 children attend primary school in Ankaran, two are enrolled in kindergarten and one in high school in Koper.

Trade unions reiterate demand for social dialogue,"Trade union representatives stepped up on Wednesday their criticism of the government's attitude to the Economic and Social Council (ESS), the country's main industrial relations forum. They fear the current standstill in the forum's operations will be used by the government for the filing of new bills uncoordinated with social partners.","After both employers and trade unions have been critical of procedural violations on the part of the government, the unionists pointed to PM Robert Golob's failure to attend an ESS session scheduled for last Friday and the employers making further talks conditional on Golob's presence.

ESS chair Jakob Počivavšek of the Pergam trade union confederation told the press that Golob was called by the unions to respect social dialogue. The prime minister was asked to inform them about possible dates for talks, but has failed to respond in what have been about two weeks.

Počivavšek said trade unions have come across reports that the government could use the standstill to by-pass the forum and push through more legislative proposals without it.

The head of the ZSSS trade union confederation Lidija Jerkič confirmed the government was inconsistent in its approach to social dialogue. Meetings are being convened at the eleventh hour or cancelled as they are about to take place. Also, the content of proposals changes during sessions or even after they are held.

Celje fail to make it to UEFA Conference League,"Having drawn 1:1 with Maccabi Tel Aviv on their home ground on Thursday in the return leg of the last round of qualifications, Celje have failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League.","The tie comes after Celje lost 4:1 to the Israel side in the first leg of the qualifier in Tel Aviv, meaning that the latter advanced with a 5:2 aggregate score.

Heading into yesterday's match, Celje knew that a spot in the Conference League was mission impossible, but the players performed well in the first half. Aljoša Matko scored in the 12th minute after Yegor Prutsev defeated the Israeli club's defence only to hit the post.

What prevented Celje from staging an upset was too many missed opportunities. Maccabi Tel Aviv capitalised on that in the second half, and it was Gavriel Kanichowsky who equalised in the 49th minute, propelling his team to the UEFA's third-tier competition.

The only Slovenian club now left in the European club competitions is the national champion Olimpija, whose 1:1 tie against Azerbaijan's Qarabag FK yesterday means it failed to make it to the Europa League and will play in the Conference League group stage.

Country-wide transport pass available as of today,"Slovenia launched a country-wide public transportation pass on Thursday, allowing passengers including tourists to use all public transport except city transport, the integration of which is planned by the end of the year. The passes considerably reduce travel costs for those who use public transportation on a regular basis.","The Slovenia-wide monthly pass costs EUR 70, a notable decrease compared to regular passes valid up until now: for example, a monthly train pass between Ljubljana and Celje would set passengers back EUR 200.

The new yearly pass now costs EUR 560. A transferable monthly pass costs EUR 90 and a transferable yearly pass is EUR 720.

The new system also includes passes for a single day (EUR 15), three days (EUR 20) and a week (EUR 35) with unlimited number of rides.

None of the new passes are currently valid for city transport. The Environment Ministry hopes to integrate the public city transportation by the end of the year, but the plan will depend on the budget for next year.

Judges and prosecutors to get EUR 600 gross bonus from January,"Attending Tuesday's general assembly of the Association of Judges, Prime Minister Robert Golob announced the plan to set up a special judiciary pay tier within the single public sector system. To show that it is serious about this, the government has decided to introduce an immediate EUR 600 gross monthly bonus for judiciary officials.","The nominal EUR 600 bonus will be put in place from 1 January and both judges and prosecutors are expected to be entitled to it.

The move is a gesture to show that the government is not just making promises, Golob told the meeting, adding that the bonus was a starting point for the planned reform.

He reiterated that 2023 would be the year of reform, not only when it comes to the pay system but also regarding efforts to ensure autonomy in judiciary. Since 2008, judges' wages have dropped by 5% in real terms while those of other public sector officials have increased by 15%, Golob noted.

Today's general assembly was convened to highlight judges' expectations and dissatisfaction with their pay. Supreme Court President Damijan Florjančič said that the back and forth over this matter had been going on for a decade and that judges were not being listened to.

One of the core prerequisites for judicial autonomy is an environment where judges are paid enough to be able to devote themselves solely to their work in judiciary, he said, adding that decent wages were also a bulwark against corruption risks.

Also attending the meeting, ex-judge and current parliamentary Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič backed judges' push for higher pay.

Before the general assembly, government representatives and members of the Judicial Council discussed the matter, including pay disparities between judges and prosecutors and officials in the remaining two branches of government - the government and parliament.

Vladimir Horvat, the council's chair, was happy that both Golob and Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik had said the government would put into motion efforts to tackle the long-standing pay issues.

"PM Golob to discuss minority, Schengen as he visits Vienna (background)","Prime Minister Robert Golob will embark on his first official visit to Austria on Tuesday, meeting Chancellor Karl Nehammer and National Assembly President Wolfgang Sobotka. Talks will expectedly focus on Slovenian minority in Austria, bilateral relations, energy, the future of the Schengen zone, war in Ukraine and the Western Balkans.","Golob's office has said ahead of the visit that the prime minister and the chancellor will pay special attention to issues important to the Slovenian minority.

Earlier this week, Golob has met the representatives of the Slovenian minority and reassured them of the country's support for their efforts for the implementation of their rights, as guaranteed by the Austrian constitution.

During that meeting Golob also underlined the importance of a bilingual justice system in the Austrian province of Carinthia, the home of most minority members.

Recently, a Council of Europe report called on Austria to strengthen the use of the Slovenian language in courts and in education. These are also the top priorities of the minority.

On the day of Golob's visit to Vienna, Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan and Minister for Slovenians Abroad Matej Arčon will be in Klagenfurt discussing the use of the Slovenian language in Carinthian courts.

In their meeting with the prime minister last week, the minority representatives also talked about negative effects of Austria's border control, which has been in place since the 2015 refugee crisis.

Slovenia has been arguing that the successive extensions of what is supposed to be a temporary, last-resort measure went against EU law and expects Austria to abandon the measure.

Golob and Nehammer are also expected to talk about energy, as the countries are interested in building a gas pipeline from the LNG terminal in Krk, an island off the coast of Croatia, toward Slovenia, Austria, Germany and Hungary.

Golob has already discussed this with his Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenković, while the Austrian chancellor has also expressed interest in the project, which is to be co-funded by the EU.

Following a meeting between Slovenia's Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and her counterparts from Croatia and Austria in April, Fajon said that Slovenia and Austria were in talks about solidarity gas supply measures, similar to that Slovenia had already signed with Italy.

The prime minister and the chancellor are also expected to talk about the Western Balkans. The countries share the view that the region was a part of Europe and want to see the EU speed up the process of expanding onto the Western Balkans.

Moreover, Golob and Nehammer will talk about the topics of the upcoming EU summit, which will expectedly focus on Ukraine. Slovenia and Austria have been providing aid to Ukraine and taking in refugees.

Golob's visit to Austria will be the third by a top Slovenian representative this year. National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič has been in Vienna twice this year, while President Nataša Pirc Musar visited in April.

Relations between Austria and Slovenia are friendly, with cooperation in culture, science and arts, as well as international organisations.

Austria is one Slovenia's key economic partners. Official data show Austria was Slovenia's the fourth biggest goods trade partner last year, with the value of goods trade reaching EUR 8.4 billion.

Slovenia exported EUR 3.6 billion worth of goods to Austria and Austria exported EUR 4.74 billion in goods to Slovenia last year.","crime, law and justice","['social issue', 'crime, law and justice', 'politics']"

Bird flu cases identified in black-headed gulls at Lake Ptuj,"Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been found in black-headed gulls on a tiny island on Lake Ptuj in northeastern Slovenia in what is another outbreak in the area. About 40 dead birds were removed by local firefighters on Monday morning, the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief said.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 was confirmed in samples taken from three dead black-headed gulls after a two-month spell of zero confirmed cases, the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary Sector and Plant Protection said on Tuesday.

Previously, bird flu cases were confirmed in the local black-headed gulls in March.

This time around, after spotting a large number of dead birds on Monday morning the locals informed the relevant authorities of the situation.

The Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary Sector and Plant Protection has called on poultry farmers and captive bird owners to heed preventive measures, which are important to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus from wild birds to poultry or pets.

The measures, which apply to the entire country, recommend keeping poultry or captive birds inside or preventing any contact with wild birds. The farmers or owners are also urged to immediately seek veterinary assistance if they notice any irregularity or bird flu symptom in the animals.

In 2022-2023, the first confirmed case of bird flu in poultry in Slovenia was recorded at a poultry farm near Cerklje na Gorenjskem, north of Ljubljana, in February, and it was contained not long after.

Committee okays 2040 resolution on military development,"The parliamentary Defence Committee endorsed on Tuesday a resolution on the long-term development of the Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) by 2040. Some MPs are concerned that a rise in defence spending by 2% of GDP is not ambitious enough, but the only party to oppose the resolution was the Left.","Defence Ministry State Secretary Damir Črnčec told the committee that the key reason for the new resolution only a year after the previous had been adopted was the changed security landscape, pointing to the Ukraine war, and Sweden and Finland joining NATO.

Among key innovations, he listed the formation of two battalion battle groups that will take place at the same time and not in stages, the purchase of medium-range air defence systems, efforts to step up helicopter capabilities by replacing existing helicopters and buying four additional aircraft, and investment in research and development.

Rajko Fajt from the National Council welcomed the new document as he expressed the hope that the 2% of GDP target is reached as soon as possible. The upper chamber of parliament is also in favour of Slovenia building up its own ammunition production capacity.

Democrats (SDS) MP Jožef Lenart is concerned that the 2% goal is not ambitious enough because if the economy starts to cool down, the numbers can quickly decrease. Nevertheless, the largest opposition party intends to vote in favour of the new resolution in the National Assembly.

Representing New Slovenia (NSi) on the committee as an MP, the opposition party's leader and former Defence Minister Matej Tonin regrets that the document does not envisage the possibility of reintroducing mandatory military service or the development of a military higher education institution.

Despite the downsides, his party will endorse the resolution in parliament as it supports the rise in defence spending.

MP Miroslav Gregorič from the ruling party Freedom Movement said that the document lacked sufficient ambition when it came to funds and the target number of soldiers. Still, the party will vote in favour.

He joined the calls for domestic ammunition production and he would also like to see Slovenia producing military equipment.

The junior coalition Social Democrats (SD) will also support the resolution in parliament. MP Damijan Zrim agreed there was the need for ammunition production.

Črnčec told the MPs that the Defence Ministry had called on Slovenian companies to explore the possibility of producing ammunition.

The only party that is expected to vote against the resolution is the Left. MP Miha Kordiš criticised the planned purchase of a second Spartan transport aircraft. This will be used to supply SAF members on missions abroad, however the existing Turbolet aircraft is used for 80% of its flight hours for this purpose already, he said.

Wondering why such an important document was being adopted at an emergency session, Kordiš said that money spent on buying weapons was money polluting the environment.

The resolution was endorsed in a 10:1 vote as was the decision to urge the National Assembly to vote on the matter in March.",politics,"['politics', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"
Boxmark Leather in the green again,"Boxmark Leather, the Kidričevo-based car upholstery maker, saw its sales revenue rise in 2022 by some EUR 8 million to just under EUR 60.5 million, despite global supply problems in the car industry. For the second year in a row, the company operated with profit, which reached EUR 2.2 million.","In 2022, the automotive industry faced a shortage in semiconductors, which led to factories closing down and to disrupted deliveries, Boxmark director Marjan Trobiš wrote in the annual business report. He expects that the supply chain will stabilise in the second half of 2023 and that the sector will recover at the start of 2024.

Boxmark has nonetheless managed to keep the core business in the automotive sector and increase its presence in other sectors, such as aircraft, ship and train upholstery.

In 2019, it turned to more profitable processes and decreased the labour intensity in certain processes to raise the added value of its products in the long run.

The company was able to absorb the loss from previous years with the increased efficiency and end 2022 with a profit of EUR 2.2 million, compared to EUR 1.5 million in 2021.

The shortage of semi-conductors in 2022 delayed the launch of many new models for leading European brands, including Volkswagen, whose serial production of the VWT7 model was delayed, which has also affected Boxmark.

The company, which has around 530 employees, will continue production in programmes with a higher added value to meet its goals in 2023.

It will also continue to restructure its programmes and decrease dependence on the automotive sector by increasing aviation programmes. A major project was secured some time ago with Fly Emirates to equip airline seats with leather seat covers.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the company employed some 1,400 workers and generated just under EUR 150 million in sales in 2019.","economy, business and finance","['science and technology', 'economy, business and finance']"
Faculties grind to a halt as pay disparity solution is sough with govt,"Lectures, exams, and thesis defences were cancelled and libraries closed at Slovenia's three public universities for the second in two weeks on Tuesday as part of a strike accompanying talks on pay disparities in higher education.","The rally, whose central venue this time was the Ljubljana Social Sciences Faculty, is a continuation of a strike that the Higher Education Union began in March 2022 to demand proper valuation of labour, elimination of pay disparities and normal working conditions.

The union's head Gorazd Kovačič said the strike was continuing because the negotiations will lead nowhere without the mass support of the strikers gathered today.

He acknowledged that the proposal presented by the government to higher education teachers had not been bad, but he added that the problem was the valuation of other professions in the sector, such as lectors, librarians, IT specialists, accountants and services staff.

With the talks taking place against the backdrop of government efforts for a pay reform of the entire public sector, Kovačič noted that gaps of four pay brackets have occurred in relation to healthcare workers and that the government-proposed adjustments for the higher education sector were insufficient.

He was also critical of the government introducing ever new angles into the talks, one of them being a reduction in the number of days of leave.

Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Igor Papič and Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik had been invited to attend today, but they ended up being replaced by two puppets seated in chairs in front of the strikers, who shared their stories with them.

The strike will continue on Wednesday, with various events taking place at individual faculties. Further strike action is planned for mid-October, followed by strike weeks in November, December and January if needed, Kovačič announced.

As for the reform of the public sector wage system, Kovačič believes that negotiations on separate wage pillars will be long and difficult. That is why, according to him, the higher education trade union is likely to demand ""solo negotiations"" to try to resolve the most glaring pay disparities in the field.",education,"['labour', 'education']"
Judge Kogovšek Šalamon disqualified from RTV Slovenija case,"The Constitutional Court has disqualified one of the judges, Neža Kogovšek Šalamon, from the high-profile case concerning public broadcaster RTV Slovenija while rejecting two more disqualification motions, the STA has learnt. One judge having disqualified himself before, it will now be up to seven judges to reach a final decision.","The motion to disqualify the judge was made by Peter Gregorčič, the chair of the RTV Slovenija programme council, because she continues to work part-time at the Peace Institute, which took part in the campaign for the referendum on the RTV Slovenija act late last year. Kogovšek Šalamon also proposed that herself.

Two other disqualification motions were rejected on the grounds that they were not tabled on time. The government and National Assembly proposed the disqualification of Klemen Jaklič, who advocated the existing 2005 act on RTV Slovenija at the time, while the director of the broadcaster's TV arm, Uroš Urbanija, sought to disqualify court president Matej Accetto.

The disqualification motions have been interpreted by media and jurists as attempts to sideline judges that are deemed either as too leftist, such as Kogovšek Šalamon and Accetto, or too conservative, which is the charge often levelled against Jaklič.

The court is now left with seven judges to decide the fate of legislative amendments, confirmed at last year's referendum with a clear majority, that the government says will depoliticise the broadcaster after it was staffed with people close to the previous, rightist government of Janez Janša.

The leadership appointed during Janša's term meanwhile claims that the amendments would repoliticise the broadcaster, which is only now ""ideologically balanced,"" having previously been a stronghold of leftist parties.

The new leadership has been in a long dispute with a significant portion of the news staff, who have formally been on strike for almost a year and recently staged a 24-hour work stoppage.

The journalists argue the new management has been bringing in new staff with close links to rightist parties, bullying journalists, silencing critical voices, and destroying the outlet with low-quality shows headlined by inexperienced staff.

The amendments would reform the governance structure and if they take effect, senior staff would be replaced, including the entire programme council and the top tier of management.

The Constitutional Court has been deliberating the case since the beginning of the year and in February stayed key provisions of the amendments before they could take effect.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice']"
Finance critical of govt reform abilities,"Finance expresses doubt that the government will be able to carry out reforms it has announced, pointing to a high level of uncertainty in the country. The business newspaper is worried because it seems like the government does not know what it is doing.","It seems Slovenia can forget about the tax reform for a while after Prime Minister Robert Golob announced he was taking over the project. How he will do this remains a mystery, the paper says. ""How is he going to communicate the reform in which taxpayers had believed until he himself started causing confusion?""

Confusing communication accompanied by uncertainties in business and a high inflation rate cause concern for the taxpayers, entrepreneurs and investors. And this is just in relation to taxes. There is also uncertainty in healthcare, about additional contributions for pensions and long-term care.

Will people get what they are entitled to by paying more for healthcare and long-term care. Or will the higher contributions be spent on higher pay for doctors? Will the government be able to address the issues in the public sector?

""Uncertainty is a fact. Not just because businesses and people cannot know what is coming ... It is worse that it seems like the government does not have a clue either. It seems like it is only putting out fires it started while creating smokescreens,"" the paper says under the headline Fiscal and Administrative Pay Slurry.",politics,"['economy, business and finance', 'politics', 'health', 'social issue']"
Atlantic Grupa inaugurates its biggest solar plant in Rogaška Slatina,"Atlantic Grupa, a Croatian multinational that owns Slovenian food company Droga Kolinska, has inaugurated a EUR 900,000 solar plant on the roof of a beverages production facility in Rogaška Slatina, east Slovenia, on Tuesday. The group's vice president Enzo Smrekar said it will generate 1 gigawatt of electricity annually.","Slovenian Minister of the Environment and Energy Bojan Kumer said on the occasion that investment in renewable electricity is the right way to decarbonisation.

He welcomed investment by businesses into sustainable operations, saying that a major shift towards renewables is what will take us on the path of green transition.

Last year, the energy crisis led the government to increase investments in the electricity distribution centre and a few months ago, through a public call for tenders, EUR 80 million from the recovery and resilience plan was made available in grants to reinforce the voltage level of the distribution networks.

The new electricity plant, Atlantic Grupa's biggest, will produce 31% of all electricity the Rogaška Slatina facility needs, thus reducing dependency on external sources, optimising costs and contributing to environmental protection, said Smrekar.

At the same location there will be two solar-powered filling stations for electric vehicles, he said, adding that sustainability has been an important part of Atlantic Grupa's business strategy for more than a decade.

Asked why the mineral water Donat is not bottled in glass bottles, Smrekar said they are heavy, which raises the cost of transport and emissions. And when the bottles are returned, a lot of water is used to wash them, so Atlantic Grupa decided on recyclable plastic bottles.

Atlantic Grupa executive director Darja Teržan said this year marks 115 years since the Donat magnesium-rich mineral water spring was discovered in Rogaška Slatina.

Production director Dušan Lorenčič said the soft drinks plant, which opened in 1972, has 73 workers and produces Donat, Cockta and Cedevita in three shifts five days a week. 50 million litres were produced last year, and the plan for this year is 60 million. Since its capacity is at only 75%, they are considering producing new drinks here.",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'science and technology']"

"Slovenia, Croatia focussing on investment in railways","Slovenia and Croatia are increasingly focussing their infrastructure investment on railways, the two countries' infrastructure ministers Alenka Bratušek and Oleg Butković said after meeting in Croatia's Opatija on Wednesday. The ministers also signed an agreement on the construction of a road bridge.","Bratušek and the Croatian minister of maritime affairs, transport and infrastructure signed the agreement on the construction of a road bridge over the Kamenica stream between the villages of Božakovo and Obrež Vivodinski. This took place on the sidelines of the Slovenian-Croatian business forum on public investment in construction, hosted by the Slovenian and Croatian media companies Delo and Hanza Media.

Addressing the forum, the ministers praised cooperation in construction projects, both at the state and company levels. ""Cooperation is key for development. We currently have nine joint projects,"" said Butković, praising construction companies from Slovenia that are participating in transport and water and utilities projects in Croatia, and Croatian companies that are participating in projects in Slovenia.

Forum participants discussed the impact of higher prices on the industry and the digital transformation, investments in railway infrastructure and construction opportunities in the Ukraine reconstruction programme. Bratušek said the biggest challenges this year would be higher prices for both clients and contractors, and medium- and long-term investment planning.

She presented Slovenia's key road infrastructure projects, highlighting the third development axis and the completion of the second tube of the Karavanke tunnel on the border with Austria, which is to be completed by 2025. ""There is a two-year delay here. The key thing is that we are working well with Austria, so no further delays are expected,"" she said, noting that upon completion traffic would continue to flow only through one tube, as the renovation of the old tube would start immediately.

A major investment segment is the renovation of existing motorways and expressways, she said. ""We plan to renovate 55 kilometres of motorways and expressways a year on average, for which more than EUR 80 million have been set aside annually,"" she said, noting that EUR 342 million had also been set aside for the maintenance and construction of other roads this year.

""The priorities are green projects, safety and digitalisation,"" she stressed, adding that the main priority was rail infrastructure, with EUR 423 million earmarked for these investments. In sustainable mobility, she highlighted some EUR 100 million in investment in cycling infrastructure this year, and measures to promote public passenger transport. ""With limited financial resources available, a compromise must be found between investment in transport infrastructure and measures for sustainable mobility,"" she said.

Noting Croatia's accession to the euro and Schengen zones, the construction of the massive Pelješac Bridge, expansion of the LNG terminal on the island of Krk, and investments in road links, airports and a number of ports, Butković acknowledged that investments in rail infrastructure have so far been neglected. ""Now the big investments will focus on railways,"" he announced, mentioning plans to digitise the payment of tolls, with the prospect of a very good tourist season.

He said the construction sector still faced challenges, especially price hikes and staff shortages.

Participants of the panel said the prices of some materials had stabilised, but were much higher than before autumn 2020. Mirjana Čagalj, advisor to the Croatian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on construction and transport, said they were 30-60% higher. Kristjan Mugerli, CEO of company Kolektor CPG, said wages in the construction sector had gone up by 20%.

They also pointed to the lack of adequate staff. According to Mugerli, the interest in studying engineering had increased, but was still far lower than decades ago. He hopes that projects such as the Koper-Divača railway track will encourage young people to take up engineering as a career.

Stojan Petrič, CEO of Delo, the co-host of what is the second Slovenian-Croatian forum on public investment in the construction sector - the first one was held last year in Portorož - said that Slovenian companies, working together with their Croatian counterparts in the construction sector, were capable of carrying out any project in the Western Balkans.

The support of relevant ministries is important, but a long-term strategy to maintain the stability of the construction industry is also needed, he said.

He believes drawing EU funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan, where the construction industry plays an important role, will be a challenge. ""The challenges will be investments that will help the two countries reduce the differences in infrastructure compared to other countries and develop opportunities for the development of those sectors where they have natural assets, i.e. tourism,"" Petrič said.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance', 'human interest']"
Petrol prices up on Tuesday,"Petrol prices will increase on Tuesday, also due to the government's decision to reintroduce a renewables tax on petrol, which was temporarily scrapped last year due to the energy crisis.

New prices will be in place at pumps outside the motorway network until 17 July, the Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy said on Monday.

"Shows for minorities struggling with staff, finance","Editors of media content dedicated to minorities spoke about the challenges they face in a round table debate on Wednesday, pointing to staff shortages and financial issues. They noted the importance of minority-focused media in the broader recognition of minorities in Slovenia and in connecting with the majority population.","At the event hosted by the Institute for Ethnic Studies, Saša Banjanac Lubej, the editor and presenter of the TV Slovenija show NaGlas! for ethnic communities that hail from former Yugoslav states, spoke about the issues faced by the show.

Banjanac Lubej said that the recent decision by the management of the public broadcaster to terminate cooperation with freelance journalists of the show had left her as the only remaining contributor as of the end of March.

According to her, the decision means that the show for the Albanian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Croatian, Macedonian and Serbian communities in Slovenia is being cancelled in the form it was conceived eight years ago.

""Although limited, the show is still on the air but it cannot fulfil the conceived vision,"" Banjanac Lubej said, noting that the added value of the dismissed freelance journalists was that they spoke the languages of these respective communities.

Sandi Horvat, the editor of shows for the Roma community at RTV Slovenija, said he faced similar challenges, especially regarding the radio show, where he is the only employee and many times he has to prepare and host the show on his own.

Damian Fischer, who is a contributor and editor of the Koper-Capodistria Regional RTV Centre and a member of the RTV programme committee for the Italian minority, noted that the team had to cover multiple areas of work.

Fischer, who currently edits the prime time news show twice a week and a special 20-minute current affairs show on Fridays, highlighted the shortage of staff and finances as the largest issue.

""It is difficult to develop our culture because of the financial issue, but we work because our mission is to inform,"" he said.

Young people are interested in working as a journalist, but the problem for most of them is that they have to know Italian and Slovenian, and sometimes also Croatian. It is difficult to find someone with all these skills, he added.

Sandor Kovacs, a long-time contributor for the Hungarian radio station in Pomurje, said that the station could use a few more employees to function normally. ""In Ljubljana, three people perform the work that is done here by one person.""

The participants also noted that, in order to reach young generations, the minority media have created communication channels on the internet and social networks because ""there is no future in the long run without this"".

There were also calls to Slovenian counterparts from the mainstream media to more frequently cover minority-related topics and issues.",social issue,['social issue']
Carer stole money from mentally disabled in Črna na Koroškem,"An employee at a care facility for persons with mental disabilities in Črna na Koroškem (N) stole money, reportedly EUR 18,000, from five persons who had been entrusted to her. The centre has filed a criminal complaint and fired the carer.","The CUDV Črna na Koroškem centre, where some 260 staff take care of around 300 persons, discovered the theft in November and immediately took action, its director Dalja Pečovnik told the STA on Monday.

They agreed with the employee to end her employment, initiated a procedure for her to return the money, stepped up oversight and filed a criminal complaint with the state prosecution service.

The carer worked at the centre for several years, and part of her job was taking care of the personal belongings of those in her care.

While the director declined to reveal the amount of the stolen money, the newspaper Slovenske Novice said that it was at least 18,000 euros.

""We have zero tolerance to such events, which are unacceptable,"" Pečovnik added, adding they constantly monitored developments at the centre, keeping an eye on the money of their residents and checking the documentation. However, she believes that in this case, the situation ""somehow got out of control with various sick leaves and such"".

Pečovnik now expects an investigation to be launched as soon as possible, but police in the region of Koroška are not yet investigating the case.

The Celje Police Department said they had not been yet informed of the incident but will check whether there were grounds to suspect foul play and act accordingly.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice']"
Anti-graft commission echoes call for stricter provisions on lobbying,"Nodding to an appeal by the Slovenian Association for Legal Lobbying, the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption said on Thursday that changes are necessary to legislation governing lobbying in Slovenia.","The association responded on Wednesday to reports about the ""actions of self-proclaimed lobbyists"" - presumably a reference to a whistle-blower accusing Rok Snežič, convicted in the past for tax evasion, of corrupt practices related to motorway company DARS - to ""condemn corruption, bribery and all other unacceptable practices undermining democracy in the country"".

The lobbyists underlined their commitment to transparency, integrity and ethics and called for the institutionalisation of the lobbying profession. They publicly called for an urgent meeting with the Ministry of Justice and the anti-graft watchdog. They believe that systemic corruption should be penalised properly.

The deputy head of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption David Lapornik told the STA the commission agreed with the need for stricter provisions, including the introduction of the condition of suitability when registering as a lobbyist.

""All exceptions to who can lobby in addition to a registered lobbyist should be thrown out,"" he said.

Lapornik moreover highlighted the commission's limited scope for action that was further narrowed with legislative changes in 2020.

The commission may take infringement proceedings against lobbyists for any lobbying offences and may impose administrative sanctions, but it may only do so where there is no indication that a criminal offence has been committed. If the latter is the case, the commission must refer the matter to other authorities.

Things are additionally complicated by the commission not being able to simultaneously pursue administrative and infringement proceedings, while the same also applies for infringement proceedings and criminal proceedings. Were the anti-graft body to pursue infringement proceedings against a lobbyist in criminal procedure, it could undermine the latter, Lapornik explained.","crime, law and justice","['social issue', 'crime, law and justice']"
Coalition tables declaration on Palestine and Israel,Coalition deputies have tabled a 16-point declaration on the current situation in Palestine and Israel in which they condemn Hamas's attack against Israel while also denouncing any attacks by both Hamas and Israel on civilian targets and urging all sides to an immediate ceasefire.,"The draft declaration expresses deep concern at the escalation of violence and conflict and the worsening humanitarian situation in the Middle East, which it says threaten and undermine stability, peace and security in the EU's immediate neighbourhood.

It condemns in the strongest terms the attack on Israel by the ""radical armed group Hamas"" and stresses that terrorism and violence are unacceptable.

It also condemns any attack by Hamas or Israel on civilian targets and stresses that attacks on civilians, UN personnel, medical workers and journalists constitute a serious violation of international law.

The declaration recognises that Israel has the right under the UN Charter to defend itself and protect its citizens. However, it calls on Israel to respond to Hamas's attacks ""in accordance with international and humanitarian law since the Palestinian civilian population cannot bear the consequences"" of Hamas's terrorist acts.

Stressing the importance of distinguishing between the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspirations for a state of their own, and the radical armed group Hamas and its terrorist acts, it also expresses Slovenia's ""unwavering support for a negotiated two-state solution based on 1967 borders"".

It also calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the non-targeting of civilian objects, the establishment of a ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, the immediate establishment of humanitarian corridors, and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.

MPs urge the Slovenian government to continue its humanitarian activities in the Gaza Strip and to continue to support efforts in the international community to resolve the conflict.

The draft declaration was signed by all coalition MPs except the Left's Miha Kordiš, known for his radical pro-Palestinian views, and Mojca Šetinc Pašek, who was recently expelled from the Freedom Movement.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'politics']"

Slovenia supports joint ammunition purchases for Ukraine,"Slovenia is among the 22 EU countries that support joint EU procurement of ammunition for Ukraine, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said after Monday's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. She said defence ministers will discuss establishing an EU purchase mechanism at an informal meeting in Stockholm in early March.","A proposal for EU countries to jointly purchase ammunition for Ukraine was outlined to foreign ministers by their Estonian counterpart Urmas Reinsalu.

""The goal must be a million 155 millimetre calibre artillery shells, and the cost will be around EUR 4 billion,"" Reinsalu told the press before the ministerial.

The role of ammunition supplies for Ukraine was also highlighted by the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.

""It's crucial for the Ukrainian army to have an uninterrupted supply of 155 millimetre artillery shells at the moment,"" he said before the meeting.

Fajon outlined to her counterparts at the meeting an initiative to sign an international treaty on cooperation in criminal law that would facilitate cooperation in prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine.

The initiative by Slovenia, the Netherlands and Belgium for the treaty that would enable EU and third countries to cooperate in prosecuting these crimes had been met with ""nice support"", she said.

Fajon also invited her counterparts and their criminal law experts to attend an international conference Slovenia will host on this initiative at the end of May.

"Floods should bring reckoning in siting and engineering, experts say (feature)","The recent floods, deemed the worst on record, have created a massive challenge for hydrology experts, who will have to prepare more effective flood safety measures. Experts believe these are relatively good, but no match for an event like last week's. Reconstruction will take a long time and autumn rains will come with additional risk this year.","The floods were not completely unexpected, the STA learnt from hydrology experts, as the Environment Agency has issued warnings about this kind of danger. But still, nobody was able to imagine a disaster of such proportions.

Hydrologist Jošt Sodnik, the director of Tempos, a company specialising in waterways, landslides and erosion, underlined reconstruction will not be possible before autumn rains.

Most urgent measures will be carried out, and beds of rivers and torrent streams will be cleared out, he said, adding that the most affected areas will take priority.

""We must not forget that autumn and winter rains are still coming. Critical locations will have to be identified where urgent works will be carried out in the event of strong rainfall. Autumn will not be easy due to a greater vulnerability of infrastructure.""

Meanwhile, strong storms and rainfall are expected to become increasingly common, as the atmosphere continues to warm up, said Nejc Bezak, a hydrotechnology expert teaching at the Ljubljana Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering.

A one-percent deviation in temperature increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere by 7% and increases the potential amount of rain by 15%, said Bezak, warning that preparations must be made for the future.

Bezak believes that flood safety in Slovenia is relatively good, but some infrastructure is inadequately maintained. Moreover, the majority of infrastructure is planned for an average period of 100 years between the occurrences of inundation events, he said.

""The recent flood event was truly extreme. Some analyses we conducted for certain precipitation stations and waterways have shown some return periods of over 1,000 years, which means that such an event may take place ten times in every 10,000 years.""

""These estimates are rather uncertain,"" he added, ""given that measurements have been made only for the past few decades. It is hard to be certain about water volumes with return periods of 20, 50 or 100 years, let alone 1,000 years.""

What is more, climate change means that return periods for flood events are becoming shorter, Bezak said, adding that hydrology experts had been neglectful of climate change, especially in terms of infrastructure planning.

Relevant services should create guidelines for the determination of water volumes in engineering, which will take into account the potential effects of climate change, he said.

Sodnik said that virtually no building was designed for return periods attributed to the most recent floods, except maybe the Krško nuclear power plant. ""Flood safety measures do not provide an adequate degree of flood safety in the face of such extreme events.""

He believes the floods were all the more severe due to poor maintenance of some waterways over the course of the past 20, 30 years. ""The monitoring of erosion in torrential streams was neglected. Now towns in the Upper Savinja Valley and Koroška, above all, are literally buried under grit from torrential streams.""

No measure can ensure 100% flood safety, but a comprehensive approach in planning measures for entire river basins can significantly lower the risks, said Bezak.

First and foremost, torrential stream beds will have to be cleaned out, he said, adding that flood debris must be prevented from entering waterways.

Bezak also pointed to water reservoirs as being effective protection for densely populated areas, while green surfaces in cities are very good at absorbing precipitation.

Bezak and Sodnik believe Slovenia needs to change the approach to siting, so that building in flood zones is avoided.

""Despite the fact that good flood charts are available, flood zones are attractive to investors, perhaps because this land is somewhat cheaper than plots further away from waterways,"" said Bezak, expressing hope that the devastating floods will have served as a lesson.

Comparative analysis of areas that are flooded very rarely shows that over 50,000 buildings are located in such areas, he said. But in reality the number is higher still, because flood charts have not yet been created for all waterways in the country.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'environmental issue']"
Goran Forbici appointed head of new RTV council (adds),"The new governing council at the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija met for its first session on Monday and appointed Goran Forbici, a representative of the general public, its president with 15 votes, while 16 councillors attended.","Forbici, the director of the CNVOS centre of Slovenian NGOs, had been put forward to serve on the council by the country's Ombudsman of Human Rights.

His deputy will be Špela Stare, secretary general of the Slovenian Association of Journalists (DNS), who had been put forward by the Information Commissioner upon the DNS's proposal.

The pair are two of the 11 council members representing the general public, while the remaining six come from the RTV staff.

The session is ongoing as the councillors expanded the agenda after confirming their terms, including to appoint a commission to prepare a call for applications for a new management board.

The management board has been introduced by the changes to the RTV Slovenia Act, which took effect last December.

Its chairman will be appointed by the council, which will also appoint another two members the new chairman will put forward, and the fourth member will be the works' director to be selected by RTV staff.

Just before the session, acting RTV director general Andrej Grah Whatmough wished the council ""a successful term marked with a lot of wisdom, tolerance and pluralism"".

He also thanked for their work the programme council and the supervisory board, which the new council has replaced as part of the government's overhaul of management and oversight at RTV.

Only 16 councillors attended the session, as Aleš Novak, who had been put forward by the National Council of Culture, had excused himself.

Today's session comes after the Constitutional Court lifted on 26 May its February stay of the new RTV legislation, challenged by the outgoing RTV leadership, while the final decision on its constitutionality is yet to be reached.",politics,['politics']

Survey: Concern over floods higher than ever during Covid,"The level of concern among Slovenian residents following the floods is higher than at any time during the Covid-19 epidemic, shows a survey conducted by Valicon. The pollster noted that the floods have directly or indirectly affected more than half of the country's population.","Almost a third of the 856 respondents surveyed on 7 August experienced the floods in their place of residence, almost one in seven of them experienced the floods in their own home.

Some 27% of the people polled said that they have a relative or acquaintance outside their place of residence whose home has been flooded.

The level of concern is at 79, seven points above the highest level measured during the Covid-19 epidemic in late March 2020, and nine above the highest level of concern related to the war in Ukraine, measured last March.

A higher level of concern was recorded only with regard to the increased cost of living, i.e. inflation, which has been fluctuating between 83 and 93 since March 2022, Valicon noted.

The index that monitors the personal experience of the current situation reached -43 the day after the floods, which is only one point higher than its value during the epidemic in November 2021.

The respondents rated firefighters and rescuers as the groups who have best responded to the disaster and taken action, with 97% of them assessing the action by the former as exceptional or very good, and the share being 94% for the latter.

Some 40% of the people polled said that the protection and rescue system at the national level is organised and managed very good, and 54% said it was good.

On the other hand, the respondents are not so sure about the government response and measures taken so far in relation to the floods, with 43% saying that they have been ""partly adequate and partially inadequate"".

The survey also shows that 43% of the respondents participate in the flood relief efforts, and that an additional third of them are willing to help, while currently not participating in the effort.

Almost 30% of the people polled believe that they probably or definitely live in an area at risk of floods and landslides.

"Country's sole velodrome fixed up, ready for reopening soon","After the airdome cover of Slovenia's only velodrome in Češča Vas, near Novo Mesto in the southeast, collapsed in January, the damage has now been repaired and a new inflatable cover installed. Cyclists will be able to resume training in the velodrome soon, its operator announced on Thursday.","The cover had collapsed due to the weight of water collecting on the top of the dome as the heavy snow cover was melting. The damage was estimated at up to EUR 100,000.

The new inflatable membrane cover was put up by the airdome maker Duol with the help of members of the Slovenian Armed Forces.

After the water had been pumped out, repair and cleaning work is now being carried out at the venue and a new fence is being installed.

Aleš Makovac, the head of the Novo Mesto municipal company operating the velodrome, told the STA today that cyclists could resume training there within a week, while those practising track and field would be able to start their workouts by the end of the summer break.

After the national championship in velodrome racing had to be cancelled after the incident, Makovac now said competitions are planned to resume in autumn.

The velodrome operator also said that it will now have full access to the velodrome's roof, which had previously been limited. This will allow for a quicker response in case of emergency.

After the original velodrome, built in 1996, became dilapidated, the Novo Mesto municipality, together with the relevant ministry and several sports associations, committed to making the new velodrome ""an nationally and internationally recognised sports venue"" for cycling, athletics and triathlon.

The investment was worth around EUR 4 million, with the ministry and the Slovenian Sports Foundation chipping in some EUR 600,000. The airdome was erected in 2019.

The municipality is also building a swimming pool next to the velodrome with the aim of establishing an Olympic training centre in the future.",sport,"['disaster and accident', 'sport']"
"Flooding continues in Gorenjska, Koroška (adds)","Flash flooding continues in the northern regions of Gorenjska and Koroška, the region hit hardest on Friday, as heavy rains pounded the country throughout the night. In south Slovenia, the Sava spilled over as the water surge travelled downstream, the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration said on Saturday.","The Poljanska Sora, which flooded Škofja Loka yesterday, continues to flood. The same goes for the Kamniška Bistrica, which caused massive flooding yesterday around Kamnik, Domžale, Komenda and Mengeš.

The situation is particularly dire in Koroška, where Črna na Koroškem, a town in a narrow valley, remains cut off without power, water or telecommunications as bridges collapsed and roads were swept away, according to local civil protection.

""The only connection we have with Črna na Koroškem is via the emergency lines with the firefighters, all other connections have been severed. We still don't know the true extent of the damage there,"" Alan Matijevič, the regional civil protection commander, told the STA this morning.

""The top priority is getting to Črna so that we can ship aid, people and machinery there. We have to brig them food and water, they are also running low on diesel to power the generators,"" he said.

Elsewhere in Koroška the situation remains serious in the Mislinja Valley, where multiple bridges have collapsed. In the upper Drava Valley landslides are the main problem but infrastructure has not been damaged as badly, he said.

In the south of the country The Sava, of which all Gorenjska rivers are direct or indirect tributaries, continues to swell and is not expected to reach its maximum level for the next few hours.

The water surge reached the lower Sava, north of the border with Croatia, last evening necessitating the evacuation of a campsite in Čatež ob Savi, a popular spa and water park.

The Krka, a Sava tributary which joins the rive near Brežice, is swollen as well but is not expected to flood outside the areas that it typically floods.

The Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration said most other rivers, including the Mura and Drava in eastern Slovenia, are swollen but water levels are slowly receding.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'environmental issue']"
More ambitious draft of national energy end climate plan ready,"The government approved on Thursday a second draft of the updated national energy end climate plan, which it says brings some more ambitious goals. The required share of renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption in 2030 is being raised from 27% to 30-35%, depending on the relevant measures.","The latest draft was compiled after the public consultation in spring and will now be sent to the European Commission for evaluation, Environment, Climate and Energy Minister Bojan Kumer told the press after the government session.

The current national energy end climate plan, which was adopted in February 2020, covers the 2021-2030 period with a view until 2040. It pays special attention to the 2030 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and interconnectivity of the electricity production sources.

Kumer said that the planned updates brought more ambitious goals, including on the required share of renewable energy sources in the final energy consumption in 2030. It is now set at 30-35%, ""depending on what measures will be taken"", up from 27%.

The minister noted that, when it comes to traffic as one of the largest consumers of energy and one of the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, the expected emission growth was being reduced to 3% from the current 12%.

The new draft also envisages a greater reduction of emissions in industry. While a 43% contraction is planned in the current document, the updated version aims at a 55% contraction. In the energy sector, a reduction of 48% is planned (up from 34%).

""When it comes to connectivity, Slovenia is an exemplary and above-average member state, which is connected to the neighbouring energy systems,"" Kumer said.

He noted that the proof of this was the past winter, when Slovenia was able to import all the energy it needed in some moments to ensure energy security.

Asked when Slovenia could reach carbon neutrality, the minister noted that a long-term climate strategy had been adopted by the previous government, which set the timeline for this at 2050. Other strategic documents must follow, he added.

The existing energy end climate plan needs to be updated due to the decision to phase out coal by 2033, the higher climate and energy targets until 2030 at the EU level, and the need to accelerate the green transition, Kumer added.

The Youth for Climate Justice meanwhile held a meeting in front of the government building to note that the plan did not take into account the seriousness of the climate crisis, the binding goals of the Paris accord and the findings of scientists.

Its member Sara Štiglic called on the government to amend the plan so as to take into account expert opinions, environmental organisations and the broader public, as the movement wants more ambitious goals to prevent climate breakdown.

""The document should prevent the green transition from going into the hands of capital, set more specific goals for energy saving, improve the powers of public stakeholders and focus on the true well-being of people and the environment,"" she said.

The plan should also feature a chapter devoted to the restoration and preservation of biodiversity, which is a key factor in mitigating climate change, with an emphasis on ecosystems, Štiglic concluded.",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'social issue', 'science and technology']"
Golob and two ministers attending NATO summit,"PM Robert Golob will attend a two-day NATO summit that starts in Lithuania on Tuesday and focuses on bringing Ukraine closer to NATO. His delegation will also feature Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and Defence Minister Marjan Šarec. As part of the summit, the NATO-Ukraine Council will hold its first meeting.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to take the opportunity of the NATO-Ukraine meeting to urge the allies to invite Ukraine into NATO, and the summit is expected to confirm that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance.

Golob said on the sidelines of an EU summit at the end of June that one of the conditions for the launch of talks on Ukraine's NATO membership was lasting peace in Ukraine. He said there was no doubt that Ukraine was on the Euro-Atlantic path.

An issue in the debate on Ukraine's NATO membership is how to ensure that Russia does not simply take a break and then attack its neighbour again, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last Friday. He welcomed the consultations of individual allies with Kyiv on security guarantees at bilateral level.

The Slovenian Foreign Ministry has told the STA that Slovenia does not intend to participate in providing bilateral or multilateral security guarantees to Ukraine until it joins NATO. ""Slovenia remains committed to assisting Ukraine in all respects to the best of its ability, as it has done so far,"" the ministry wrote.

In the light of Russian aggression against Ukraine, Stoltenberg announced that NATO leaders would endorse a new defence spending commitment, under which 2% of GDP would be the lower limit and no longer the upper limit for defence spending.

This year, 11 of the 31 members will spend 2% of GDP or more on defence, and next year this number will increase significantly, Stoltenberg said. Slovenia will spend 1.35% of GDP on defence this year, according to NATO's estimates.

According to the resolution on the long-term development and equipping of the Slovenian Armed Forces, endorsed by the National Assembly in March, defence spending is to increase to 2% by 2030.

During the part of the meeting dedicated to strengthening NATO's defence and deterrence posture, the leaders are also expected to approve new regional defence plans today. The plans for NATO's northern, central, and southern regions, which also include Slovenia, envisage having 300,000 NATO troops on high alert.

The second day of the summit will be partly dedicated to talks with the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, as well as the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, respectively.

Apart from Golob, the Slovenian delegation will include Foreign Minister Fajon and Defence Minister Šarec, who will take part in meetings with their counterparts.

On the sidelines of the summit, Golob will meet Finish President Sauli Niinistö today and Fajon will meet her Romanian counterpart Bogdan Aurescu.","unrest, conflicts and war","['politics', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"
Public sector trade unions ready to suspend protest rally,"The negotiating group of public sector trade unions is ready to temporarily suspend the ""protest rally for decent pay"" that was announced for 24 February. Since the government has started talks by presenting proposals for the pay system reform, the trade unions are willing to give the negotiations a chance.","""If it turns out that adequate solutions cannot be reached in negotiation, if the government enforces its own solutions or sets unreasonable conditions, the negotiating group of public sector trade unions will carry out the protest without hesitation,"" the negotiation group leader, Jakob Počivavšek, wrote in a press release on Tuesday.

The key points for the group are the elimination of pay disparities and the uncompetitive wage policy.

Although the negotiating group is sceptical about the proposals, at least some of them partly meet their expectations, so they are willing to give the government an opportunity at the negotiating table, Počivavšek wrote.

The trade unions find most problematic the proposals to suspend promotions and job performance pay-outs, the pay tiers that would lead to different treatment of employees in different activities and unclear ratios between those tiers. These measures ""do not bring any added value and will not address any of the problems of the current pay system but they might complicate the negotiations on its reform,"" the trade unions said.

""It remains unclear what will be the exact substantial proposals for elimination of pay disparities and to what extend the government recognises these disparities and is willing to eliminate them,"" Počivavšek wrote.

The trade unions sees as positive the suggestion of increasing the lowest salary to minimum wage, which ""actually shows the willingness to eliminate pay disparities"".

The negotiating group will insist on a unified pay system, based on the principle of equal pay for equal work even in different activities. The group noted that the government has pledged that the trade unions must concur on the fundamental questions of the pay system, adding that all solutions must be reached through dialogue and implemented through collective bargaining agreements at least to the extend that this is done today.

The negotiating group will respond to the proposals in detail at a negotiating meeting scheduled for Monday.",labour,"['labour', 'economy, business and finance']"
Former ministers critical of situation in the country,"Several former senior officials, including Slovenia's first prime minister Lojze Petrle, and long-serving foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel, offered their critique of the course Slovenia is taking in a debate held in Ljubljana on Wednesday by Cathedral of Freedom, a libertarian association.","The debate touched on topical issues such the cancellation of the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Communism and the initiative for a memorial to Slovenian independence, which the speakers said should unite rather than divide the nation.

The initiative for the monument, to be erected in the Republic Square in front of the parliament building, has most recently been made by Slovenia's first President Milan Kučan, after Peterle presented a similar proposal to the then President Borut Pahor as the country marked 25th independence anniversary.

Peterle insists that such a monument should be based on a law and a call based on national consensus. Rupel agreed that a solution should be sought which would unite and avoid what divided.

However, tackling the monument issue alone would not do with Peterle arguing the education system should do a better job teaching about independence.

He accused the government of attempting to return Slovenia to a world the country abandoned when it went independent. He listed the decisions to abolish the Museum of Slovenian Independence as an independent institution and cancel the day in memory of communism victims as well as a minister's appearance at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the 1937 inception of the Communist Party of Slovenia.

Jurist Peter Jambrek, a former minister and president of the Constitutional Court, believes the situation in the country is cause for concern, mainly because the values of Slovenian independence are neglected.

Jambrek believes that despite those tendencies, Slovenia is in good shape. ""Private business, free enterprise, is on the rise, and state-owned enterprises and public ownership are increasingly proving inefficient and not very beneficial for people, a process that is unstoppable.""

""The current bizarre calls to halt these democratic and economically libertarian, free-thinking processes"" show the ""major concern of the old forces,"" he argued.

Žiga Turk, another former minister, think the situation in the country is worrying, but people do not see this because nothing dramatic is happening. However, there is a visible gap between Slovenia and other East European countries.

""The gap between Slovenia and the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia was narrowing at first, but now it is widening again, because these countries are progressing much faster than Slovenia. They are progressing because they have adopted values, institutions, systems, recipes that have been proven to work,"" he said.

He added that the values of the former state were being preserved in Slovenia, but there was an absence of an equal confrontation of ideas. Equal weighing of ideas, he said, is essential for democracy.

""Actions, not statements, undermine what the republic is based on, what we fought for,"" said former Finance Minister Janez Šušteršič. In his view, there is a lack of understanding of what the state is based on, and that in 30 years Slovenians failed to learn how to manage their state.",politics,['politics']
Most international rail transport generated with Austria,"Most people who travelled from or to Slovenia by train last year did so on rail links with Austria, which recorded 164,300 passengers, the Statistics Office said this week. Passenger numbers reached almost 14.9 million, up by almost 26% on the year before, when railway transport was still affected by the Covid pandemic.","According to the data, 98% of Slovenia's entire international railway passenger transport was conducted with Austria. Croatia follows with 97,100 passengers, Germany with 39,300, Italy with 27,700, Hungary with 16,800, and Switzerland with 12,700.

Domestic railway transport figures stood at some 13.5 million, (91% of the total), which is 18% more than in 2021, while just under 1.4 million people travelled on international links and in transit, which is almost four times more than in the year before. Transit figures alone stood at just over 989,000, a five-fold increase on the year before.

Domestic and international railway transport racked up a total of 835 passenger-kilometres on the annual level, up by 54% year-on-year.

Domestic transport accounted for almost three quarters (some 612 million passenger kilometres) of the total, up by 25%, and international transport accounted for nearly 223 million passenger kilometres, over three times more than in the previous year.

Pirc Musar underlines importance of CoE at Reykjavik summit,"The Council of Europe (CoE) may play an important role in establishing responsibility for international crime, and international cooperation will be key in this, Slovenia's President Nataša Pirc Musar said at the outset of the CoE summit in Reykjavik on Tuesday.","Alongside Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Pirc Musar hosted a round table debate dedicated to the need to establish responsibility for atrocities in Ukraine.

In her opening remarks, she said the CoE continued to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and show solidarity with the people of Ukraine, while condemning the Russian aggression. Support for multilateralism, based in international law, is as important as ever, she underlined.

The president also welcomed the warrant recently issued for the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged illegal deportation of children. ""Sexual violence and illegal relocations of millions of children must not go unpunished.""

She noted that the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression had been established in the Hague and that an investigation had been launched with the support of Eurojust and cooperation of ICC.

The president also pointed out that the Reykjavik CoE Summit would produce the Enlarged Partial Agreement on the Register of Damage Caused by the Russian Aggression. She believes an efficient connection must be established between the register and the future general mechanism for the prosecution of the crime of aggression.

On the sidelines of the summit, Pirc Musar held several bilateral meetings, among them with the CoE's Human Rights Commissioner Dunja Mijatović. The president said human rights were among the top priorities of Slovenia's foreign policy, adding that the country ascribed great importance to the European Court of Human Rights.

Mijatović and Pirc Musar also discussed gender equality, with the latter saying that meaningful actions of women must be at the centre of all peace-related activities to ensure sustainable peace and security. This will be a key principle for Slovenia if the country is elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2024-2025 in three weeks, she said.

Pirc Musar also met her Icelandic counterpart Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson. The pair affirmed friendly relations between their countries and shared the view that finding like-minded partners was very important for geographically small countries such as Iceland and Slovenia.

Pirc Musar also talked to her counterparts from Slovakia and Czechia, Zuzana Čaputova and Petr Pavel, inviting them both to attend Bled Strategic Forum this year.

She held separate meetings with them during their shared flight to Iceland. The meetings affirmed good relations and stressed the importance of unity among European countries in advocacy of basic values, such as human rights and the rule of law.

Today, Pirc Musar will address the general discussion of the summit and participate in the closing debate, where leaders are expected to adopt a political declaration.

Govt provides EUR 150m to enhance renewables,"The government adopted on Thursday a regulation to facilitate introduction of renewable sources of energy, putting in operation an emergency law which brought a legal basis for incentives for renewables investment. A public call to investors to apply for a total of EUR 150 million in available incentives will be ready in September.","The regulation comes just days after the European Commission greenlit Slovenia's renewables incentives scheme.

Environment, Climate and Energy Minister Bojan Kumer said he is happy that Slovenia is one of the first EU countries to get the approval.

Eligible to receive incentives will be new energy production facilities, facilities to store electricity and heat and facilities to produce heat from other renewables.

The government will thus encourage electricity production from solar, geothermal and hydro power stations with an installed capacity of up to one megawatt, or up to six megawatts if the plant is 100% owned by small or medium-sized companies or by a renewable energy community which is a legal person.

Electricity from wind farms with an installed capacity of up to one megawatt or up to 18 if the plant is fully owned by micro or small companies or by a renewable energy community which is a legal person will also qualify.

Incentives will moreover be available for co-generation of electricity and heat from wood biomass, geothermal energy, biogas, landfill gas and gas from sewage treatment plants, as well as for production of heat from wood biomass, solar and geothermal energy, including heat pumps.

The construction of facilities to store electricity or thermal energy will also be eligible for support, with legal persons, cooperatives, physical persons owning a business, and municipalities being allowed to apply for the funds.

The regulation was adopted based on the Act Regulating Emergency Intervention to Address High Energy Prices, which was passed last December, setting down energy saving, incentives for renewables investments, a windfall tax for energy companies, and heating prices regulation.",environmental issue,"['environmental issue', 'politics']"
Golob and Bettel call for walls-free Europe,Prime Minister Robert Golob and his Luxembourgian counterpart Xavier Bettel called on the EU to look for common solutions to migrations as they addressed reporters after their meeting at Brdo pri Kranju on Wednesday.

Minister calls for swift efforts to mitigate storm damage,"Having gotten briefed on damage caused by recent severe storms, Agriculture Minister Irena Šinko warned against visiting damaged woodland areas and expressed support for swift restoration efforts. Friday saw another batch of storms accompanied by strong gusts of wind and hail in certain areas. The northern Koroška region was hit hardest.","Visiting the Naklo area near Kranj in the north, the minister warned against further spread of bark beetle infestation in Slovenian forests, which are vulnerable to these pests in the wake of storms or drought.

The damage in agriculture is significant, she noted, but she finds some solace in knowing that it could have been even worse and is hopeful that the country will now get a reprieve from storms.

Gregor Danev, head of the Forest Service, believes that priorities must be set in recovery and clean-up efforts to prevent additional bark beetle attacks, ensure clean water supply and avoid floods. Cooperation with forest owners is vital, he added.

According to rough estimates, some 450,000 cubic metres of timber in the country's forests has been damaged recently. The 13 July storm hit the entire northern Slovenia, and all the storms that followed only exacerbated the situation. The worst hit are the northern Gorenjska and Koroška regions, he said.

Initial estimates show that at least 150,000 cubic metres of timber has been damaged in state-owned forests, which is more than 10% of the annual production, the state-owned forestry company SiDG said. Recovery efforts are underway, but it will take a long time to clean up the mess the storms left in their wake. State-owned forests account for 20% of all Slovenian forests.

Together with experts, the minister cautioned citizens and tourists against visiting the affected woodland areas. ""Even when recovery efforts are seemingly done and the mushroom foraging season opens in autumn, instead of looking for mushrooms it would be wiser to look out for broken branches,"" Danev said.

Šinko also visited affected farming areas in the north-east of the country. The state will provide aid, she said earlier, pointing to more than EUR 7 million available through several funding sources.

Under existing legislation farmers are not eligible for aid in the event of hail-related damage since they can purchase crop-hail insurance, but since in certain areas the entire harvest has been destroyed, the government is preparing changes to the Natural Disaster Recovery Act to provide dedicated aid.

The Environment Agency issued a red alert for the central and western parts of the country for this afternoon. Storms with hail and strong gusts of wind hit certain parts of the country, causing additional damage.

The Črna na Koroškem area in the north was hit hardest with raging torrents causing floods. Several roads are closed and 20 people had to be evacuated due to the risk of landslides, the local unit of civil protection told the STA.

Showers and storms will persist on Saturday, but they are not expected to be as severe as today. The weather will offer a reprieve on Sunday and Monday, when sunny skies are forecast.",disaster and accident,"['disaster and accident', 'politics']"

Following Russia's exclusion from the CoE in March 2022 over the country's aggression against Ukraine, the CoE remains ""the conscience of Europe"", the tweet reads.

The ministry moreover posted a brief video on Twitter with Minister Fajon and Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan's statements on the occasion of the 30th anniversary.

Švarc Pipan said that with its rulings the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) significantly contributes to the efforts to strengthen human rights and the rule of law as well as to the effectiveness of court proceedings in Slovenia.

""Slovenia enjoys a reputation among the member states as a country that effectively and consistently implements ECHR judgements,"" she said, adding that Slovenia currently ranks fourth among the member states in this respect.

The CoE was founded 75 years ago, and it became the first European organisation Slovenia joined after declaring independence in June 1991.

This was a key step in the process of gaining international recognition, helping the country on its way to achieving one of its main foreign policy goals - EU membership.

Slovenia applied for membership on 29 January 1992 and was admitted to the oldest pan-European organisation promoting human rights and democracy on 14 May 1993. It has also joined all key CoE conventions.","crime, law and justice","['human interest', 'unrest, conflicts and war']"

Dnevnik says strengthening NATO logical development,"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO has got its original purpose back, which can be seen at the ongoing summit in Lithuania, where its deterrence has been strengthened in several ways, Dnevnik says in Wednesday's commentary Deterrence in Vilnius.","After the fall of the Iron Curtain, NATO wandered a bit, expanding without an obvious opponent and embarking on missions far from its borders.

Now it is back on the terrain for which it was created, and it is strengthening there, which is the result of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions.

With all the problems and failures of his war in Ukraine, it is hard to believe that Russia is really capable of a serious invasion of Eastern Europe.

Nevertheless, Putin has turned the unthinkable into the real by aggression on European soil, so strengthening NATO's deterrence is its logical consequence, including new strategic plans for NATO's north, east and south wings, increased financial commitments on defence investment and the admission of new members, all of which also enjoy quite comfortable public support, at least in most of its members.

Dnevnik also says that several US media have recently reported about contacts and communication of official and unofficial US representatives with Russia's representatives, which shows that ""something seems to be going on behind the scenes"".

It would not be unthinkable if the US tested the situation to find the way to end the Ukraine war before the US presidential campaign is in full swing and before a potential change of power takes place at the White House.

If so, the Ukrainian leadership faces very difficult decisions and dilemmas, more difficult than NATO, unless Donald Trump happens to win the election, because Russia will stay where it is even if and when peace comes, which is probably also true for Putin.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war', 'politics']"
Interior Ministry to get less funds under revised budget,"The Interior Ministry will get less funds than initially planned under the revised 2023 budget proposed by the government due to Croatia's accession to the Schengen area, the parliamentary Committee on the Interior, Public Administration and Local Self-Government learned on Friday. The Public Administration Ministry will also receive less funds.","The Interior Ministry will have EUR 552.3 million at its disposal this year, or EUR 22.3 million less than initially budgeted, the ministry's State Secretary Tina Heferle told the committee.

The cut in funding is mainly the result of Croatia's accession to the Schengen area from 1 January 2023, which means reduced workload for Slovenia's border police. The work of the ministry and the police will not be impaired in any way as a result of the cut, she added.

More than EUR 14 million initially allocated to protecting the Schengen border is now being redistributed, and will go to cover the wages of police officers transferred from the Slovenian-Croatian border areas to the interior of the country.

Not a single Slovenian police officer who protected the EU's external border before Croatia joined the Schengen area will be let go, and their status will not worsen, Heferle said.

The ministry's funds regarding migration and international protection have been decreased, as delayed implementation in this area will postpone the disbursement of European funds. Heferle assured the MPs that these funds are not lost but merely carried over to the next year.

The overall drop in funding under the supplementary budget mainly affects the police's budget and to a smaller extent the ministry's, while the amount of the funds projected for the Internal Affairs Inspectorate remains the same.

Some opposition MPs expressed concern about less funding to tackle illegal migration despite upward trends in this area.

Meanwhile, the committee also learnt today that the Public Administration Ministry will receive EUR 58.4 million less than initially planned mainly due to the transfer of its ICT competences to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, which is the result of a government reshuffle completed in January.

The Public Administration Ministry will get EUR 202.2 million under the revised budget, the ministry's State Secretary Jure Trbič said.

The Ministry of Digital Transformation is also projected to receive less funds under the supplementary budget proposal - down by some EUR 10 million to EUR 114 million, said the ministry's State Secretary Miroslav Kranjc.","crime, law and justice","['economy, business and finance', 'politics']"

Govt adopts bill to boost air connectivity with new subsidies (adds),"The government adopted on Thursday a bill envisaging EUR 5.6 million in state aid to secure better air connectivity, which Infrastructure Ministry State Secretary Alenka Bratušek said experienced substantial decline in the past two years. The aid scheme remains to be approved by the European Commission.","The move comes after the state already provided air connectivity schemes involving subsidies for airlines in 2021 and 2022.

While Bratušek, scheduled to become minister, spoke during her confirmation meeting earlier in the day of a bill that would enable the subsidising of passengers as opposed to airlines, the government press release states aid would be allocated to carriers for new routes or more frequent flights on existing routes in line with European Commission guidelines on such aid.

Only direct links will be financed via the scheme, which will consist of subsidies amounting to up to 50% of the airport charge to the carrier.

The legislation was drawn up jointly by the Economy Ministry and the Infrastructure Ministry, which Bratušek said would also determine together a list of destinations to be included in the scheme on the basis of their significance for Slovenia.

""Our financial estimate is EUR 5.6 million per year, based on the assumption that we will secure ten daily connections for about 255 days of the year,"" Bratušek told the press after the government's session. She added the estimate was also based on the assumption that there would be between 120 and 130 passengers on board.

Detailed criteria, the rate of co-funding for individual routes and the routes entitled will be laid down in a special programme. After the programme's adoption a public call will be published by the Infrastructure Ministry, the government explained.

A carrier will only be eligible for aid if the new route or a new schedule of existing routes with increased flight frequency had not been established or planned within 12 months of the publication of the call.

Given that the scheme constitutes state aid, an approval is needed from the European Commission. ""We have already forwarded the bill to it. We are acting fast because we want to get there before the summer season, which already starts at the end of March,"" Bratušek said.

Economy Minister Matjaž Han agreed the bill was important. ""We have secured a source of funding for air links in Slovenia for a period of three years,"" he said.

Better connectivity is vital for Slovenia to be well integrated into global currents, Han said. ""Slovenia is an export-oriented economy, we have quality tourism and therefore we need good air connections,"" he added.

The Government Communications Office pointed out that Slovenia recorded the biggest drop in air traffic in the EU in 2020 compared to the previous year, according to data from Eurostat.

Nineteen scheduled routes operated at Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport in the summer season 2022, compared to 29 in 2019, while 42% fewer flights were recorded last August than in August 2019.

""Slovenia also does not yet have a flag carrier, which is another reason why we are facing a slow recovery in air traffic,"" the government added.

Bratušek explained that a task force continues to examine the feasibility of the state starting a new flag carrier following the bankruptcy of the privatised Adria Airways. ""I believe that somewhere by the middle of the year we will be able to come up with an answer based on sound facts and data,"" she said.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
General govt deficit in Q1 up y/y to EUR 544m or 3.6% of GDP,"The general government deficit amounted to EUR 544 million in the first quarter of 2023, or 3.6% of Slovenia's GDP, up by 0.5 percentage points year-on-year, the Statistics Office said on Friday. At the end of March, the general government debt stood at EUR 42.19 billion, or 69.5% of GDP.","The general government deficit in the first quarter of this year was up from EUR 416 million or 3.1% of GDP from the same quarter last year.

The general government sector saw an increase in total revenue in the first quarter of 2023 for the ninth consecutive quarter. It amounted to just under EUR 6.27 billion, EUR 486 million or 8.4% higher year-on-year.

The total revenue was increased the most by revenue from social contributions, which was up by EUR 223 million or 9.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. Tax revenue was up by EUR 182 million or 6.5%.

In nominal terms, expenditure on employees increased the most, by EUR 156 million or 10%, while subsidies to businesses and households were up by EUR 152 million or 97.6%.

Investment in gross fixed capital formation was up by EUR 152 million or 24.1% compared to the first quarter of 2022, and expenditure on social benefits increased by EUR 120 million or 4.7%.

However, the general government expenditure increased even more than revenue, totalling EUR 6.81 billion, EUR 613 million or 9.9% more than in the first quarter of last year.

At the end of the first quarter of this year, the gross general government debt stood at EUR 42.19 billion, or 69.5% of GDP. In nominal terms, it was up by EUR 946 million or 2.3%, while as the share of GDP it was down by 5.1 percentage points.

The central government debt accounted for the largest share of the gross general government debt - EUR 41.39 billion or 68.2% of GDP, while the total debt of municipalities stood at EUR 1.02 billion or 1.7% of GDP.

The pension and health insurance funds were without debt at the end of the first quarter.

The Finance Ministry has estimated that the general government deficit will increase to EUR 2.62 billion by the end of the year, or 4% of GDP. The general government debt is also expected to increase slightly in nominal terms, to EUR 44.61 billion.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
PM and National Assembly president shut door to pensioner rally head after offensive statements (adds),"The office of the prime minister and National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič joined on Thursday the condemnation of offensive statements by the leader of pensioner rallies Pavel Rupar and ruled out the possibility of future dialogue with ""individuals and groups spreading hate speech"".","The reaction came after Rupar, a former MP for the opposition Democrats (SDS), took issue during Wednesday's rally with an adviser to President Nataša Pirc Musar, saying that Biserka Marolt Meden ""must be removed"" over her involvement in a proposed bill enabling assisted dying.

As Rupar led the mass of what were mostly disgruntled pensioners from the square in front of the parliament building to the Presidential Palace, he also said that ""even Hitler in the German Reich would have been be happy about such an adviser"". ""The Nazis helped the mentally handicapped and then the elderly to an early death,"" Rupar added.

A response was issued immediately by Pirc Musar, who spoke of reprehensible and ""brutally hateful words coming from someone who has a long history of doing this"", to add she would expect other state institutions and individuals to speak out against what she considers an attack on the aides and the institute of the president.

The office of Prime Minister Robert Golob, whom Rupar said he had already met in the past month and was promised ""equal partnership"", indeed wrote today that there will be no cooperation with those manipulating and misleading the public.

""Political propaganda based on manipulation and misleading the public through the use of inappropriate visual elements and hateful rhetoric is inappropriate and undermines democratic dialogue in the country. Such practices are harmful to the social climate and unacceptable. Thus, the government will not engage in dialogue with such individuals and groups,"" the office wrote after the rally, whose participants also put on show stuffed birds of prey and a dead pigeon (golob in Slovenian).

The door to Rupar was also shut by Klakočar Zupančič, who said she was calling off a 16 May meeting with him she had previously agreed to, as there is no room in parliament for the kind of trampling on dignity witnessed at Wednesday's rally in Ljubljana, the forth in as many months.

She said that the National Assembly supported decent and respectful communication and a critical, even harsh, confrontation of opinions, but not insults and ""blows going ever lower below the belt"". Nor must there be tolerance for hate speech, which can very quickly escalate into physical violence. Freedom of speech, she added, reaches to where the freedom of the other begins.

While a condemnation of Rupar's statements was moreover issued by the senior coalition Freedom Movement, which Klakočar Zupančič said had been established precisely as a response to such practices, a reaction also came from the junior coalition Left, the only party to have so far explicitly backed the assisted dying bill.

The Left described Rupar as ""a figurehead resurrected from political isolation, installed to exploit pensioners' discontent and to take on the political opponents on the right"". Rupar ""is no more concerned about the elderly than he was when he still had an active political career at a time when the SDS was in power pursuing neoliberal and anti-social policies"", the party added.

Strongly condemning Rupar's statements, the coalition Social Democrats (SD) said hate speech has no place in society, adding that such practice of ""manipulation, deception and trampling on human dignity"" was inappropriate and an extremely bad example.

Only inclusive society will seek compromises and solutions in a respectful social dialogue for a better life for everyone, including pensioners, the party said, expressing support for Marolt Meden in her efforts for debate and change regarding rights to euthanasia.

Rupar was also condemned by the non-parliamentary Pensioners' Party (DeSUS), which said that he had crossed all boundaries of human dignity and mutual respect, expressing the hope that Rupar will assume moral and criminal responsibility for the uttered words.",politics,['politics']
"Eight Slovenians leave Sudan, ministry says","Eight members of an extended Slovenian family have safely arrived in Slovenia from Sudan, where an ongoing armed conflict between two military forces has been taking place since mid-April, the Foreign Ministry told the STA on Tuesday.","Out of some ten Slovenians, two groups of four have left Sudan, where clashes broke out between the commander of the Sudanese army, Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman al-Burhan, and his deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the RSF paramilitary group.

One family is from the conflict-stricken capital of Khartoum, the newspaper Večer writes.

The other Slovenians are in Port Sudan on the Red Sea, in the north-east of the country, from where it is much easier to leave the country, head of the Slovenian Foreign Ministry's consular service Andrej Šter said.

The UN estimates that at least 700 people have been killed so far, 190 of whom were children. An additional 6,000 people have been injured and over a million forced to leave their homes.

After the US and Saudi Arabia stepped in, the two opposing sides signed a seven-day humanitarian ceasefire agreement on Monday, with the possibility of extension. Because the six previous ceasefires have been violated, the current one will be monitored by a 12-member cross-party committee.","unrest, conflicts and war","['unrest, conflicts and war']"
Ministries commit to taking on overcrowded closed wards of psychiatric facilities,The ministries responsible for the field committed as part a meeting at the Supreme Court on Tuesday to immediately start addressing the continuing acute shortage of space and staff at the closed wards of long-stay psychiatric facilities in the country.,"The meeting was initiated by Supreme Court president Miodrag Đorđević as the latest in a string of efforts and decisions by the judiciary that began in 2016. They have included the Constitutional Court ruling in 2019 in a complaint regarding the conditions in a closed ward facility that the current law on mental health is at odds with the constitution and that adequate capacities need to be secured without further ado.

Secure wards however remain overcrowded and and there are still no specialised wards for seriously perilous individuals and for children.

In addition, due to overcrowding and inadequate conditions, institutions are refusing to admit the most dangerous patients, which poses an extreme problem for the courts, as judges have nowhere to put people who would best be cared for in secure wards, the Supreme Court said in a press release.

In line with a Supreme Court decision from 2019 that is also being followed by other courts, individuals that cannot be accommodated at long-stay facilities are being being sent back temporarily to psychiatric hospitals.

""However, this is constitutionally inadmissible because it means that there is less space in hospitals for people who need acute inpatient psychiatric treatment,"" the court added.

The meeting was attended by Minister of Labour, Family, and Social Affairs Luka Mesec, Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan, Deputy Human Rights Ombudsman Ivan Šelih and representatives of the ministries for a solidarity-based future and for health. They agreed that the acute issue needed to be solved as soon as possible and committed to introducing concrete measures.","crime, law and justice","['social issue', 'health']"
"Finance urges rational debate on minimum wage, income inequality","The business daily Finance calls for a rational debate about the minimum wage and, more broadly, wage inequality in Monday's commentary, drawing on international comparisons showing that Slovenia already has some of the most equal wages in the world, one of the lowest income inequalities, and one of the lowest at-risk-of-poverty rates.","""I know that everyone wants more - and often they deserve more. This does not mean we have enough for everyone. The problem is that we keep falling into the chasm of poverty and wealth where ideology, not rational arguments, underpins the debate,"" says the commentary Slovenia, the Best Country for Poor People.

Piecemeal wage changes destroy established pay ratios. The minimum wage has a particularly significant impact because the higher it is, the more people will earn close to minimum wage. ""And this triggers another round of wage hikes due to imbalances that occurred the last time [minimum wage] rose,"" the paper says.

Slovenia behaves as if ""we are not integrated in the world economy, which dictates not just the competitiveness of our economy but also the value added that forms the basis of our wages.""

""No, it is not good to be among those who are poor. But in any distribution some will always fall into that group, whether in Slovenia or Switzerland. Politicians refuse to understand that according to this logic, the fight against poverty never ends. As a result, everyone is approaching minimum wage and poverty.""

According to Finance, economic logic is ""virtually powerless against populism and the ideology of greater equity in Slovenia. Do we have enough strength to break this spell after decades?""",social issue,"['social issue', 'labour', 'economy, business and finance']"
Ministry to fund extra PE classes in primary school,"The Education Ministry has published a call for co-financing of additional physical education classes in the school year 2023/24. The EUR 1 million grant will help finance PE teachers in first through third grade of primary school. To be eligible for funding, schools will have to offer at least one additional PE class per week.","The money will also help cover costs of sport facilities, said Education Minister Darjo Felda at a press conference last week, explaining that could also mean swimming pool entry fees or ski passes.

The application deadline is 12 May, said State Secretary Boris Černilec. Each school will be eligible for up to EUR 10,000 per school year.

During the pandemic motor skills in children decreased by 17%, showed research by the SLOfit group at the Ljubljana University. Sport is the solution and a relief in the education system, said Freedom Movement MP Robert Janev, who is advocating for additional PE classes.

Every year children return to school after summer vacation in worse shape than they left it, said Felda, adding that this shows schools are the place where everyone can be sufficiently active.

SLOfit analyses show that additional sport programmes offered by schools are ineffective as they are often not taught by PE teachers and have large class sizes. The group has proposed that the ministry requires these programmes be taught by PE teachers.

Beloved emperor's visit remembered with exhibition in Kranj,"The regional Gorenjska Museum is launching an exhibition on Tuesday remembering a 1883 visit by the very popular Emperor Franc Joseph to what were then Styria and Carniola, hereditary lands of the Habsburg empire.","In July of 1883 the visit brought the emperor to Ljubljana and what is now the region of Gorenjska in nortwestern Slovenia.

During his 68-year rule, Franz Joseph enjoyed his subjects' affinity as the most popular member of the Habsburg dynasty, and Slovenians were no exception.

Running until 1 October, the exhibition titled Our Emperor Is Here, Gorenjska Bows to Him sheds light on how the ruler shaped the lives of the nations living in his empire.

He toured his lands to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the Habsburg's rule and was greeted by cheering crowds in Gorenjska.

Being the biggest celebrity of that time, newspapers published a detailed itinerary of his visit and reported his every move, as attested by the exhibition at the Prešeren House in the Kranj old town.

The emperor started his visit in Laibach, now Ljubljana, which was the capital of Carniola. He stayed there for five days before relocating by an open chariot to Gorenjska for two days, stopping in Cerklje, Šenčur and Kranj along the way.

According to a folk legend, he dined on the staple Carniolan Sausage in Naklo, but there is no record of that happening. However, documents exist proving that the pork delicacy was part of his diet at his court in Vienna and was supposedly imported from Carniola.

The only other memento of his visit to Gorenjska is a marble commemorative plaque that was built into the wall of the church in Cerklje, which is now on display at the museum, said Anja Poštrak, one of the authors of the exhibition. Most other artefacts come from the Lokev Military Museum.

Franz Joseph then travelled to Lesce by train and paid a visit to the women's penitentiary in Begunje before concluding his trip in the scenic Bled, where he was taken to the little island by boat and enjoyed a splendid festivity with lights and bonfires.

Jesenice was on his itinerary the following day. There he greeted the crowd one last time before continuing his tour to Italy's Tarvisio and then returning to Vienna.

Franz Joseph was met with admiration, ceremonial receptions and the highest of honours by the people of Gorenjska.

This was the only opportunity for the commoners to see the emperor in person and the visit was ingrained into the community's memory long after he and the monarchy were gone. Franz Joseph died of pneumonia in 1916.

The many reforms he implemented during his rule paved the way for research and development in various domains. Some of the most important projects of the time were finalizing the construction of the Southern Railway running from Trieste to Vienna and rebuilding Laibach after the devastating earthquake in 1895.

There were, of course, topics on which Slovenians did not agree with those in power. Criticism at the time was mainly directed at the decision-makers' handling of national issues.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment']"
Soldiers celebrating Armed Forces Day with people,"Slovenian Armed Forces (SAF) Day will be celebrated on Saturday, with the country remembering the day in 1991 when the first generation of Slovenian conscripts started training. There will be a series of dynamic demonstrations by soldiers around Stožice Arena in Ljubljana in the morning and a ceremony with a concert in the evening.","The programme will start with children's workshops where kids will learn how to mask their faces, and try their hand at obstacle courses and inflatable games.

This will be followed by presentation of more than 20 units and 50 professions within the army to try to make people interested in joining the army.

The units will present their activities to show who they are, what they can do and what their purpose is, according to Maj-Gen Robert Glavaš, chief of the general staff.

Visitors will get an opportunity to learn about military training and education and about job requirements to join the army. They will also be able to take a ride in APCs, or try shooting, resuscitation, martial arts, etc.

As part of the dynamic demonstrations by a specialised military police unit, an aviation unit and a naval unit, the visitors will see liaison operations, a vertical manoeuvre, the deployment of a light anti-aircraft Stinger missile system, a facility blockade, aerial surveillance and care, and the extraction of a casualty.

Speaking to the press earlier this week, Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said this is the army and ministry's gift to the people, arguing the army must be among the people and serve them.

The celebrations will continue inside Stožice Arena at 6pm with a formal ceremony to be followed by a concert by the SAF's Big Band and several guests, including rock band Siddharta's frontman Tomi Meglič, pop singer Amaya, and pop act Bepop.

Ambassadors of Slovenian business discuss role of excellent design,"Successful Slovenian companies are messengers of Slovenia as a technologically developed, creative and green country, and a key part of this are functional products with excellent design, several ambassadors of Slovenian business agreed at a panel discussion in Portorož on Wednesday.","They believe it is crucial for competitiveness that the functionalities and design of products are at the highest level, as evidenced by the Red Dot Design Award, conceived in Germany in the 1950s.

As one of the most prestigious design awards in the world, Red Dot means great recognition for its recipients, which reflects in sales and a higher value added, the panellists said.

For the last decade, Slovenian companies have been standing alongside the biggest multinationals in design, the panellists said, adding these companies understood design adds value and had a positive impact on their business.

The discussion featured Leon Korošec and Marko Škrbin from sports goods maker Elan, Matej Feguš from designer chair manufacturer Donar, Niko Medved from kitchenware maker Plastika Skaza, Anže Miklavec from water bottles maker Equa, and David Piber from shoe maker Alpina.

They said the main goal was positioning Slovenian companies as top businesses with excellent products and great design. This would also raise the profile of the brand Made in Slovenia, which should gain global recognition, ""but we are not doing enough to achieve this"".

The meeting of the ambassadors of Slovenian business was also attended by Economy Minister Matjaž Han, who stressed that the ambassadors were distinguished by their credibility and competence.

""The ambassadors stand for the values we strive for, and they also spread the word about Slovenia's competitive advantage in the global market.""

Han said the government would keep supporting the Slovenian economy, including financially. So far 110 R&D projects have been supported with EUR 70 million, which has, among other things, boosted Slovenia's ranking in the Innovation Index, he said.

Rok Capl, acting director of the public agency SPIRIT, stressed the importance of Slovenian business ambassadors in achieving key goals: ""It's about strengthening technological development and being a green country at the heart of Europe.""

Since 2019 SPIRIT has been running the national promotional campaign I Feel Slovenia. Green. Creative. Smart. in order to boost the reputation of the Slovenian economy abroad.

As part of the campaign, it has selected 41 ambassadors - exceptional companies which stand out for their breakthrough business models, solutions, products and services, and contribute to Slovenia being seen in foreign markets as a technologically developed, creative and green country.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment', 'science and technology']"

The main goal of the office is to assist Slovenian civil society and institutions in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia in preparing content and tenders for the European Capital of Culture 2025 in both cities, the association's head Robert Frandolič said.

Since it opened at the start of the year, the office has bought together several partners and produced projects worth over EUR 1 million for an open call of the local European Association for Territorial Cooperation.

Frandolič hopes many business ideas are developed here, a view echoed by Minister Arčon, who would like to see Slovenian business people around the world cooperate as well as they do in the neighbouring countries. He also hopes the office continues to operate beyond 2025.

""This office is certainly a piece of this historic moment, because the area of Goriška, if you look at the whole Slovenian border, is by far the most connected. This is a huge competitive advantage in this area and is also important in the wider area,"" Arčon said in his address.

Since being founded in 1946, the Slovenian Regional Business Association has been a bridge between Italy and first Yugoslavia before it is now a bridge with Slovenia, said its president.

The association brings together around 600 micro and small companies in the areas of Trieste, Gorizia and Cividale, including two banks. It is very active in the Alps-Adriatic region, ""working very well together with our friends from Carinthia, Hungary and Croatia"", said Frandolič.","arts, culture and entertainment","['economy, business and finance']"
Weather: Heavy snowfall in the morning,"Slovenia, including most of its low-lying areas, will get a big batch of snow on Monday morning.

Ministry argues optional conservation measures ineffective,"After reports that the ongoing dispute between farmers and the government may soon be resolved by making certain Natura 2000 restrictions non-mandatory, the ministry for natural resources stressed the need to achieve Natura 2000 conservation objectives. Measures can be optional, but as such they have not been effective in the past, it said.","Amid efforts to draw up the 2023-2028 programme for Natura 2000 management, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning said on Thursday that the nature conservation objectives included measures to improve grassland biodiversity, an effort that was linked to farming intensity.

""Talks to address this issue are ongoing,"" the ministry's State Secretary Matej Skočir told the press in Ljubljana after the Farmers' Trade Union, which has been in talks with both the natural resources and agriculture ministries, said last Friday that the government had agreed to make the restrictions optional.

Skočir said that they were going though the proposal and would respond to it accordingly.

Slovenia must reach the objectives, not least because of a European Commission letter of formal notice about the failure to meet targets for grassland species and habitat types.

""One of the possible solutions is to achieve the objectives through non-mandatory measures, but unfortunately, experience shows that this has not reached the nature conservation targets.""

Failure to meet these targets increases the risk of less Common Agricultural Policy funds or a possible lawsuit by the Commission, he added.

Katarina Groznik Zeiler, another senior official at the ministry, said that the ministry had not completely discounted optional measures.

Commenting on farmers' claims about the potential unconstitutionality of the Nature Conservation Act, which would affect the relevant regulation too, the ministry said that its legal service deemed the law to be in line with the constitution, so the government had the right to impose Natura 2000 restrictions.

The proposed 2023-2028 programme and the draft regulation on this programme stipulate bans, conditions and restrictions on farming in Natura 2000 sites of the karst area Planina Polje and the Ljubljana Marshes.

For example, in certain grassland areas mowing would be allowed only once a year, at the end of June, from 2024, and fertilisation, grazing and the use of plant protection products would be prohibited.",environmental issue,['environmental issue']
Top court rejects appeal against Dnevnik's 2013 reporting on Mercator sale,"The Constitutional Court has turned down an appeal by Tomaž Lovše, the former owner of Diners franchise in Slovenia, to have the newspaper Dnevnik retract and apologise for its 2013 reports about the sale of retailer Mercator.","Lovše was appealing the decisions of the district and higher courts which rejected his claims against the paper, with the Constitutional Court now finding that freedom of expression outweighs Lovše's right to privacy in this case.

""There was a strong public interest in the information about the course of sales of state assets, namely companies and banks in state ownership,"" the court said.

In 2013, Dnevnik ran a series of articles about the sale of Mercator to the Croatian conglomerate Agrokor. The reports were based on leaked police wire tap transcripts that suggested Lovše played a prominent role in lobbying for Agrokor.

At the time, Lovše was being detained as part of an investigation into the management of the Diners franchise, and even claimed the detention was part of a plot to prevent the sale of Mercator. To prevent further reports, he requested and was granted a gag order against Dnevnik.

The Mercator sale went ahead, while Lovše pleaded guilty to syphoning off EUR 7 million in money owed to merchants by Diners.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice']"
Efforts under way to reduce congestion on motorways,"The Infrastructure Ministry is making efforts to reduce congestion on Slovenian motorways in the foreseeable future, Minister Alenka Bratušek said on Tuesday as she visited the motorway company DARS's regional control centre near Domžale with Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar, who announced more police presence on the motorways.","Valentin Hajdinjak, chairman of the DARS management board, said that traffic in Slovenia is increasing by up to 10% annually, and so is the number of incidents. Last year there were 38,000.

He briefed the ministers on the work of DARS control centres and the Traffic Information Centre, and on projects designed to improve safety and traffic flows, including smart motorways, digitalisation and intelligent transport systems.

Bratušek said that ""we're on the right track with digitalisation and smart traffic management, but we're not yet where we want to be"".

Her ministry is making efforts to improve traffic management at least to the extent to minimise congestion, but she said this could not be done overnight.

She partly attributed the congestion to the many construction and maintenance works, including on railways, but ""once they are over, the situation will improve"".

Poklukar said traffic has increased particularly towards Croatia, which he attributed to the southern neighbour's entry into the Schengen zone on 1 January 2023.

As regards repeated calls by hauliers for a third lane on the Ljubljana ring road and the motorway access roads to the capital, Bratušek said these projects are on the table but cannot be done overnight.

Both ministers urged tolerance on the roads and understanding of the situation, with Poklukar saying congestion is not limited to Slovenia, it is present around Europe.

As for police presence on the motorways, Poklukar said ""Slovenian police remains on Slovenian motorways even if the motorway police unit was abolished"".

There are currently eleven police patrols around the motorway network and the wish is for the number to further increase in the coming year.

They also want to form a permanent police team to work at the Traffic Information Centre, because ""it's the speed of information and adequate action on the road that can not only prevent major congestion, but also enable accidents to be dealt with more quickly and the flow of traffic to be diverted to bypass roads"".

Both Poklukar and Hajdinjak believe another measure to make traffic run more smoothly and safer is putting in place average speed control on certain motorway sections. DARS is working on a a new tender after the previous one was not successful.",disaster and accident,['disaster and accident']
Transmission grid operator ELES gets EUR 25m loan from EBRD,Slovenia's national transmission grid operator ELES has received a revolving working capital facility of EUR 25 million from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to support its needs after a period of high energy prices in Europe.,"ELES will use part of the loan to purchase electricity on the spot market and to cover other general expenses. The money will facilitate ELES's continued investment in the electricity grid to ensure the voltage conditions are in line with the criteria of the European Network of Transmission System Operators.

In a 9-year network development plan, ELES is planning new basic infrastructure as well as new smart-grid components for the integration of renewable sources, including modern battery storage. ELES also noted that the government is encouraging the production of electricity using solar and wind energy.

""We are looking forward to be able to provide more financing for ELES's investments that are key to developing a system of renewable energy sources and a green energy transition,"" wrote EBRD's head of energy in Europe Grzegorz Zielinski in a press release.

ELES manages 2,900 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines and employs 550 people. The Slovenian grid is connected to the neighbouring Croatia, Italy and Austria, EBRD said.

The loan is part of the EBRD Resilience and Livelihoods Framework that the management board approved in April 2022 to help the countries affected by the war on Ukraine with one of the priorities being energy security.

To date, EBRD has invested EUR 1.5 billion in 106 projects in Slovenia.","economy, business and finance","['environmental issue', 'economy, business and finance']"
Govt's air connectivity efforts to focus on ten destinations (adds),"A call for applications to support airlines flying to Slovenia in line with a law envisaging a total of EUR 16.8 million in state aid over the span of three years is expected to be published this month. The priority list includes ten destinations: Vienna, Brussels, Copenhagen, Athens, Madrid, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Prague, Berlin and Skopje.","The programme envisages subsidising 50% of airport fees at three Slovenian international airports - Brnik, Maribor and Portorož - for airlines that will fly to the desired destinations.

The first priority list includes connections to the ten priority destinations. For Brussels, Skopje, Prague and Berlin the request is a direct connection, and for Vienna, Copenhagen, Athens, Madrid, Amsterdam and Helsinki at least an indirect connection is to be set up.

If any funds are left, the list will be expanded to Rome, Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Lisbon, Prishtina and Paris, Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek told the press today.

If any other funds are left, all destinations in the European Common Aviation Area, meaning EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo will be included, Bratušek said.

In line with the law passed at the end of January, EUR 5.6 million will be available to airlines in annual subsidies over the next three years, so a total of EUR 16.8 million. The funds have already been set aside in the budget of the Infrastructure Ministry, Bratušek said.

The move is yet to be approved by the European Commission. ""We are in contact almost daily. We expect the approval this month, which means the call for applications could also be published this month,"" the minister said.

The plan is to publish the call on 24 March. Carriers will have 30 days to apply. If not all funds are distributed, another call will be published on 1 July.

Economy Minister Matjaž Han said the programme had been drawn up ""by the book"", so he expects no problems with the approval from Brussels.

It is important that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ""Without connectivity, there can be no good and export-oriented economy or tourists,"" he added.

Air traffic in Slovenia is only slowly recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapse of national air carrier Adria Airways in 2019.

The government is tackling the issue with this programme while also analysing the possibility of founding a new flag carrier. ""We will discuss this when thorough analyses are conducted,"" Bratušek said.

Even if a decision is made to set up a new national carrier, the process will take some time, while the country needs better connectivity now, Bratušek and Han said in explaining the decision for the subsidy scheme.

""It is a temporary measure, so we must find a better solution. Together with the Infrastructure Ministry we are working on documentation or a programme about the possibility of setting up a new air carrier and then the government will decide how to proceed,"" Han said.

During the pandemic, the state distributed EUR 5.6 million in two calls for applications in 2021 and 2022. A total of 11 carriers that operated 2,600 flights to Slovenia and transported 121,000 passengers received state funding, Han noted.

The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS) welcomed the programme today, saying it supported any solution for boosting Slovenia's connectivity, especially with destinations of strategic importance.

""Data shows that state subsidies to air carriers in 2021 and 2022 have been effective. This is why the GZS has been striving hard for the state to extend the subsidies of regular flights to Ljubljana airport until air traffic fully recovers,"" said Robert Sever, the head of the GZS's transport association.

The GZS does not oppose the idea of founding a new flag carrier but expects detailed calculations and a comparison with the costs of subsidies.

Similarly, the Chamber of Tourism and Hospitality welcomed the scheme, saying it had proposed to the government on several occasions to extend the subsidies for airlines as air connectivity has an important impact on tourist arrivals.

""At the end of last year, we conducted a survey among our members on the most important airlines and the results of the survey are very much in line with the flights that will be supported,"" the chamber said, adding it would also like to see more frequent flights, especially on routes to London, Frankfurt, Munich and Paris.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Italian Patrizia Raveggi wins literary translation award,The Association of Slovenian Literary Translators has conferred the Lavrin Diploma for 2023 on Italian translator Patrizia Raveggi for her superb translations and her efforts to promote Slovenian literature in Italy. She will receive the award at the ongoing Slovenian Book Days in Ljubljana.,"As an outstanding expert in the most diverse styles of language, Raveggi was praised by the jury for not shying away from the most demanding translation challenges.

She has translated a number of classical and contemporary works, from Fran Levstik and Ciril Kosmač to Vitomil Zupan, Dušan Šarotar, Katja Perat, Goran Vojnović, Tadej Golob and more, as well as many books for children and youth.

She has also written a number of essays on Slovenian literature and organised reading tours of Slovenian authors in Italy.

""The numerous and in-depth coverage of Raveggi's translations in the most prominent Italian daily newspapers, literary magazines and online media testify to the fact that Slovenian literature is increasingly being noticed and accepted by the Italian public, thanks to her work,"" the jury said.

After graduating in Italian literature and art history in Italy, Raveggi was an Italian language tutor at the Ljubljana Faculty of Arts for a number of years.

She has also served as an Italian culture diplomat and held several cultural offices, while she has become an established translator of Slovenian and English literature since the mid-1980s.

The Lavrin Diploma award was introduced in 2003 to promote quality translation of Slovenian literature as well as of books of humanities and social sciences.

It is named after Slovenian literary historian, translator and author Janko Lavrin (1887-1986), who was a member of PEN International and founder of the Slavic studies department at Nottingham University in the UK, where he taught Russian literature.",education,"['arts, culture and entertainment']"

Agency for Communication Networks and Services gets new acting head,"The government appointed on Thursday Mark Pohar as acting director of the Agency for Communication Networks and Services (AKOS). He will serve from 8 May until the appointment of the director, but not longer than six months, the Government Communications Office said.","A call for applications for AKOS head was issued last autumn but no candidate was picked, so the Ministry of Digital Transformation issued another call in early February only to withdraw it a few days later and issue another one in mid-February.

The government appointed Pohar acting director until the new director is appointed for a five-year term with the possibility of re-appointment.

AKOS is currently headed by acting director Tanja Muha. She was appointed for a full term at the beginning of November 2017 and her five-year term officially ended last November.

Pohar had served as acting director of the agency in 2011, when it was called the Agency for Post and Electronic Communications. It was renamed AKOS in 2014.",education,"['science and technology', 'politics']"
"Coalition reserved about minister's costly trip, NGO funding (adds)","Coalition partners are reserved in their comments of a costly trip to New York of Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik and the ministry's allegedly controversial granting of funds to an NGO led by the minister's former business partner. Her party, the ruling Freedom Movement, says the ministry enjoys the party's full trust.","Ajanović Hovnik recently raised dust as she and four of the ministry employees took part in a forum on sustainable development held in New York in July, with the price tag of the trip topping EUR 33,000. Now she is in the spotlight because NGO Gender Equality Research Institute, headed by Kaja Primorac, the minister's former business partner, won the most funds in a recent public call for applications published by the Public Administration Ministry.

The Commission for Prevention of Corruption is already looking into the controversial New York trip, and plans to investigate the granting of funding to the NGO as well.

The minister has rejected the criticism and insists the price of the trip was reasonable, while the ministry said yesterday she had nothing to do with the distribution of funds but merely signed the papers.

Freedom Movement MP Tereza Novak said today that Ajanović Hovnik enjoyed full trust of the deputy group. ""The minister was not involved in the process [of deciding on granting funds], she was not in the commission, and no one from her cabinet was involved in it,"" Novak repeated the ministry's statement.

Any irregularities, which Novak said she was sure did not exist, could be investigated by the competent authorities. Novak said Slovenia was a small country, so ""if ten people get together probably two will know each other"".

As for the New York trip, she said that Slovenia is part of the world and that it was important that its officials and politicians understand this world, get educated and have international contacts.

The junior coalition Left party said it expected the inquiries into the two cases to bring results shortly. ""We will talk based on these findings,"" said the head of the deputy group, Matej Tašner Vatovec. The Left also expects the prime minister to take action based on these findings.

The junior coalition Social Democrats (SD) would not comment today. The party head, Tanja Fajon, said yesterday that everyone had to explain their own travel costs, and that the minister had provided an explanation.

Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan, also an SD member, said the matter was being blown out of proportions because of ongoing negotiations on the public sector pay system.

Prime Minister Robert Golob also backed the minister earlier this week. He said that ""if the biggest problem of this country is the minister's EUR 6,000 trip to New York, we live in a happy country"".

Friday afternoon, the head of the commission that awarded the NGO funds, Luka Vidmar, gave a statement for the press, underlining that the procedure was transparent and in line with the rules.

He denied allegations that the Public Administration Ministry had affected the commission's choice and added that the commission, made up of representatives from six government ministries, had not informed the heads of the ministry about their selection before the final decision was made.",politics,['politics']
Slovenian among activists apprehended in Geneva,"A Slovenian activist is among a hundred climate activists who were apprehended in Geneva on Tuesday for blocking traffic at Geneva airport for just over an hour. According to the Slovenian branch of Greenpeace, the activists have been in detention for more than 20 hours.","The activists supporting Greenpeace, Stay Grounded, Extinction Rebellion, Scientist Rebellion and other climate movement groups from 17 countries disrupted Europe's biggest private jet sales fair, the annual European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in Geneva, demanding a ban on private jets.

Because they entered the airport, air traffic was interrupted between 11:30am and 12:40pm, with seven planes being redirected to Zürich and Lyon, the airport said, according to the French press agency AFP.

About a dozen police officers intervened to remove the protesters, including those who chained themselves to aircraft gangways and the exhibition entrance in order to keep prospective buyers from entering.

The Geneva police told AFP on Tuesday that about 80 people had been detained. Greenpeace said today that more than a hundred activists were still detained and that media had wrongly reported that the activists entered runways. The activists clearly said they never intended to obstruct commercial flights, the NGO stressed.

It reiterated concern about the pollution caused by private aircraft and called for a ban. ""The number of private flights from Slovenia increased from 244 in 2020 to 1,267 in 2022, and carbon dioxide emissions increased from 548 tonnes in 2020 to 3,802 tonnes in 2022,"" said the Slovenian branch of Greenpeace.",environmental issue,['environmental issue']

PM finds debate on progressive health insurance fee irrelevant at this time,Prime Minister Robert Golob has commented on the proposal by his coalition partners the Left for making the mandatory top-up health insurance contribution dependent on the person's income by saying this discussion is pointless for him at the moment.,"""This topic hasn't been discussed by the cabinet yet,"" Golob said on Wednesday on the sidelines of a meeting of small businesses. He said everyone had a right to their own views, both the corporate sector and ""certain political parties that want to promote their ideas"".

""The coalition has been united on changing the top-up health insurance not in the part concerning the collection of contributions but in the part that is most crucial, that is organisation,"" he said.

The coalition tabled a bill in mid-April aimed at changing now a voluntary contribution for top-up health insurance that is collected by private insurers into a mandatory levy collected by the ZZZS health insurance institute, which already collects basic mandatory health contributions.

The latter depend on the person's income, while the top-up insurance fee comes at the same amount for all insured persons. The government proposed it at the fixed amount of 35 euros to prevent insurance companies from hiking up the fee.

Golob said that just as it was a premature but understandable demand from the corporate sector not to change the top-up health insurance system it was equally premature the proposal by the Left. ""For me, this debate is completely irrelevant at the moment, because nothing concrete has happened on this subject,"" he said.",politics,['health']

Slovenia sticks to open-door policy regarding Ukraine's NATO bid,"When it comes to Ukraine's potential NATO accession Slovenia sticks to an open-door policy, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said after a two-day NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. Currently, there is no discussion on Ukrainian NATO bid and this is not expected to change any time soon, she added.","""Ukraine is currently at war, and Slovenia has been pursuing an open-door policy all along, including regarding Ukraine,"" Fajon said after the latest meeting of NATO foreign ministers that focused on further support for Ukraine and preparations for the July NATO summit in Vilnius.

On Tuesday, the NATO-Ukraine commission met at the ministerial level for the first time in six years in what Fajon described as an important sign of support for Ukraine.

The fact that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took part in yesterday's meeting and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited to attend the upcoming summit indicates a certain strengthening of political ties between NATO and Ukraine, Fajon said.

However, Ukraine's potential NATO accession itself was not on the agenda of today's meeting, and such a discussion ""is not expected any time soon"".

During the meeting, Fajon highlighted the importance of accountability for finding all those responsible for atrocities and horrific crimes committed due to Russian aggression in Ukraine.

"Downgraded GDP estimate will affect reconstruction plans, says Delo","The downgraded estimate for Slovenia's GDP growth in 2022 will have several consequences, including for the country's post-flood reconstruction plans, says the newspaper Delo's commentary on Friday.","Revisions of statistical data are usually technicalities, interesting for analytics or other experts but not for the public.

It is rare that a revision significantly changes the initial estimate, but this time around the GDP growth estimate for last year went down by nearly three percentage points.

Saying that this is a result of the German economy's troubles, the front-page commentary notes that GDP growth is what finances the population's living standards.

The downgraded estimate will increase the country's debt and it might cause credit ratings agencies to downgrade Slovenia's ratings, the newspaper says, wondering what will happen to ""required yields on our government bonds"".

The government's economic forecaster is in trouble too, having to prepare projections for next year. ""Reduced economic growth will affect the budget, perhaps less money will be available to municipalities.""

Biggest observation satellite operator acquires Sinergise,"The Ljubljana-based geographic information system (GIS) company Sinergise was acquired by Planet Lab, the San Francisco-based operator of the largest Earth observation fleet of imaging satellites, at the beginning of August, the US company said on Monday. The value of the deal, which was closed in March, has not been revealed.","The acquisition of Sinergise strengthens Planet Labs' ability to efficiently deliver Earth observation data to its customers, the company said in the press release.

Sinergise has developed Sentinel Hub, a solution that significantly reduces the time it takes between the satellite taking an image and the image being available for use. The hub's integral part is the Earth Observation (EO) Browser, an open-access tool for people to browse and compare full resolution satellite images from the data collections over long periods of time.

""Sinergise's talented team will become an integral part of Planet's operations in Europe, expanding the company's European base to nearly one-third of Planet's global workforce,"" Planet wrote. The US company will now have two additional offices in Europe, one each in Slovenia and Austria, in addition to its current offices in Berlin and Haarlem.

The companies, which have been cooperating as partners since 2016, announced the takeover at the end of March.

Slovenia in 2023,Below is an overview of major events scheduled in 2023 and predicted developments:,"<b>DOMESTIC POLICY</b>

After the completion of a reshuffle under which the government will have twenty ministries, which is expected in the first half of January, the cabinet is expected to start preparations for some major reform efforts, most notably reforms of pensions, healthcare and taxes.

A mini reform of public sector pay has been announced as well, along with an overhaul of labour law that is expected to bring such perks as a 30-hour work week (on a voluntary basis) and better rules for remote work. The outlines of a new national housing policy are expected as well and work has already begun on a reform of media law.

Economic growth is projected to slow sharply - hence the reversal of tax cuts - whereas the energy crisis will persist, presumably for several more years, forcing the state to extend aid to the corporate sector. Against the backdrop of high inflation, monetary and fiscal policy action will have to be coordinated.

Ample infrastructure spending is planned. Along with investments in new roads and upgrades of rail infrastructure, a major push is expected in investments in energy infrastructure.

<b>FOREIGN POLICY</b>

Slovenia's foreign policy efforts will be focused on the country's election to the UN Security Council for the period 2024-2025, which will require intense lobbying in the run-up to the vote in June, by both government officials and the country's president.

Two new embassies are planned to open, in Algeria as a key gas supplier and in Ethiopia as the first country in sub-Saharan Africa where Slovenia would have its embassy. A new round of diplomatic appointments is due as well, including key postings in Washington and at NATO.

A lot of attention will be dedicated to the Western Balkans. President Nataša Pirc Musar has said that her first foreign visit will be to the region, and Prime Minister Robert Golob plans to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina in January.

<b>CULTURE AND SPORTS</b>

The main cultural event will be Slovenia's appearance as the guest country at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Several major and long overdue investments are planned as well, including a new unit of the National and University Library and an extension of the SNG Drama Theatre in Ljubljana.

This will also be the year of the biggest winter sports event Slovenia has ever hosted, the Nordic World Championship in Planica in late February and early March. In June, Slovenia will be co-host of the European Basketball Championship for women. A month later, Maribor will host the European Youth Olympic Festival.

Justice minister says govt serious about fixing pay disparities in judiciary,"Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan underlined on Friday the willingness of the government to accommodate the efforts of judges, prosecutors and other judicial official to fix pay disparities. She said the EUR 600 gross monthly bonus that was announced for them this week was a temporary measure in place until a systemic solution is found.","In a response to a question by coalition Freedom Movement MP Urška Klakočar Zupančič about the timeline of the measures, Pipan explained that 1,093 judges and prosecutors would be receiving the bonus and that the annual cost of the measure was estimated at EUR 9.1 million.

The minister said the step was a sign the government was serious about implementing one of the key coalition agreement commitments - to fix, after many years, the wage disparities in the judicial system and secure judges' independence.

She noted the measures came after the government already initialled in September last year with public sector trade unions a deal on measures addressing wages and other labour costs for 2022 and 2023. The deal determined that pay for all wage brackets increase by 4.5% in October 2022.

The latest changes to the act on public sector wages will moreover bring a one-pay bracket promotion for all public servants on 1 April, while an additional, 66th pay bracket is being added to the public sector pay system.

Švarc Pipan added that the existing rankings of individual public servants and their wages needed to be reviewed and that the disparities would be addressed as part of an overhaul of the public sector pay system. A bill to this effect is expected by 30 June at the latest.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice', 'social issue']"
Delo looks at dilemmas of EU's green transition,"Europe sees itself as a leader in green transition, which is true in terms of goals yet the reality is a bit more complicated, especially when it comes to transport and a narrow range of new technologies, Delo says in its front-page commentary on Friday.","Electric mobility is being offered as an excellent solution, but Delo says there are no assessments of how battery imports will affect the competitiveness of the European car industry and the price of cars.

""The traffic collapses Slovenia is now experiencing on a daily basis will not be eliminated by electric vehicles alone.""

Under the headline Two Tonnes of Material to Transport One Person, Delo says that in Slovenia many cars, which are getting bigger and heavier, usually transport only one person, which means that one person is being transported by two tonnes of material, including hazardous, even on very short routes.

""As long as personal mobility is so energy-intensive, whether the car runs on petrol or electricity, Europe will never be energy self-sufficient.""

A zero-energy house with a solar plant, a heat pump and a filling station for the latest Tesla sounds nice, while one is not aware that the solar plant and probably the Tesla have been made in China, which, in the new world order, is no longer a friendly country.

China controls the vast majority of critical raw material flows for batteries and has cheaper energy than Europe. Without efficient waste recycling, Europe will pay a high price for its targeted green transition.",environmental issue,['environmental issue']
AmCham event stresses importance of fast response to AI,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) requires quick action and implementation of strategies in practice, agreed the participants of Wednesday's AmCham business breakfast. Teachers will play an important role in integrating digital skills in school curriculums, they noted.","Development of AI in Slovenia is systemically supported by the national programme on the promotion of development and use of artificial intelligence, adopted in 2021, said Digital Transformation Office State Secretary Aida Kamišalić Latifić, adding that activities are already underway.

According to Kamišalić Latifić, the aim of the national programme is to encourage the development of AI and AI-based services and products. She noted that regulation is necessary, but not to a point where it blocks development.

Sašo Dolenc, physicist and editor of the Kvarkadabra online newspaper for the popularisation of science, noted the importance of safe and quality use of new AI-based tools like ChatGPT. He sees the reason that the field experienced such a breakthrough in the open approach to knowledge. Technologies needed for the breakthrough are publicly available, knowledge was not hidden, Dolenc said.

It is wrong to see the AI-based tools as ""some smart robots,"" Dolenc said. They are rather tools that perform tasks ""in a very smart way"", he added. ""Suddenly we can talk to data, give certain instructions and extract information by using our everyday language,"" he said.

The development of AI will deeply affect the job market. According to advertising company Red Orbit director Andraž Štalec, agility of individuals, companies, countries and the society will be key.

Medical equipment provider Labena director Borut Čeh noted that the development of AI will have the largest impact on jobs related to text creation as AI will be used to optimise these services.

The speakers noted that digital skills will need to be strengthened, touching on the question of introducing computer science as a mandatory subject in primary and high schools.

According to Kamišalić Latifić, the Digital Transformation Office is aware of the importance of digital skills becoming part of compulsory education, but the question remains whether to implement the skills as one subject or as part of different subjects.

Dolenc noted that it is necessary to invest in good teachers that can integrate digital skills into their work. Štalec was also in favour of empowering teachers and added that digital technologies should be introduced in all areas of the education system.",science and technology,"['science and technology', 'social issue', 'labour']"
"""Shell cemetery"" in Ankaran waiting to be protected","A small port of St Katarina in Ankaran boats a special habitat of shells of dead sea animals, where some 70 various sea snails and 60 shells have been detected. Locals would like to protect the Shell Dune, known also as shell cemetery, but the land is state-owned and there are plans to expand the nearby port of Koper to this area.","The shell dune was created in the 1990s when port operator Luka Koper deepened the seabed for its second pier and deposited the silt where the Rižana flows into the Adriatic Sea. The material was then exposed to rain, wind and sea waves, which washed away the silt and a white shell dune appeared.

Debeli Rtič Landscape Park guards say the shells of dead mollusca are important as a base where sea weed, sponges and other organisms can attach themselves, and also as a home for hermit crabs and micro-organisms, while also reducing coastal erosion.

Risks to this rare habitat, the only of its kind in Slovenia, come from shells crumbling as people walk on them while they also pick shells to take them home.

While this is not an offence, environmentalists do not recommend it if the area is to be preserved. ""At some point in the future, shells will in any case become fine sand. Walking and picking up shells speeds up this process, so the dune changes more quickly than it would otherwise,"" they told the STA.

This is why the environmentalists and the municipality of Ankaran would like the area to be protected, perhaps like a nearby Mediterranean salt meadow was, which was included the Natura 2000 protected area, and visitors can walk through it only on a raised wooden walkway.

The municipality also believes the shell dune has a lot of potential for tourism. However, the area is governed by the national spatial plan for the port of Koper where a third pier is planned, which the municipality says would destroy nature in the area.

Ankaran is currently not considering giving an initiative to protect the dune, saying it would have to be coordinated with the owner, the state, ""which has plans for other activities there"".

Luka Koper is meanwhile currently not working on a third pier. ""We are giving priority to the development and expansion of warehousing and handling areas within the first and second piers, where we have all the necessary infrastructure and developed logistics,"" the company told the STA.

Debeli Rtič Park guards meanwhile urge the public to behave in line with the basic goals of nature conservation, advising people not to walk outside paths, not to disturb animals or pick ""organisms for keepsake. And don't leave behind anything, especially no litter. Take away peace, satisfaction and a beautiful photo or two,"" they say.

The park and the municipality are planning to erect an info board there this year to provide the basic information about the shell dune.",environmental issue,['environmental issue']

Slovenian Railways to buy 20 new passenger trains,The Slovenian Railways signed on Wednesday a contract to purchase 20 new Stadler passenger trains. The deal is worth some EUR 150 million and it is said to improve the quality of services in the railway passenger transport.,"The contract was signed by the director of passenger transport, Darja Kocjan, and representative of the Stadler group Željko Davidović in the presence of Prime Minister Robert Golob.

The new passenger trains, made by the Swiss Stadler, are electro-diesel multiple unit passenger trains. The contract is worth EUR 148.3 million. The first trains are set to be supplied in 2025.

Pirc Musar attending European Forum Alpbach,"President Nataša Pirc Musar will attend the European Forum Alpbach on Wednesday at the invitation of Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen. She will speak on a panel about the contribution that Slovenia and Austria can make in the areas of climate change, democracy, security and the economy, Pirc Musar's office said.","In the afternoon, Pirc Musar and the Austrian president will take part in the Austria in Europe panel to discuss the vision of a bolder Europe that must, among other things, speed up green transition, defend democratic values and take security into its own hands.

Govt's air connectivity efforts to focus on ten destinations,"A call for applications to support airlines flying to Slovenia in line with a law envisaging EUR 5.6 million in state aid to secure better air connectivity is expected to be published this month. The priority list includes ten destinations: Vienna, Brussels, Copenhagen, Athens, Madrid, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Prague, Berlin and Skopje.","If any funds are left, the list would be expanded to Rome, Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Lisbon, Prishtina and Paris, Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek told the press today.

If any other funds are left, all destinations in the common European area, meaning the EU, Norway, Iceland and the Balkans, will also be included on the list, Bratušek said.

In line with the law passed at the end of January, EUR 5.6 million will be available to airlines in annual subsidies over the next three years. The move is yet to be approved by the European Commission.

""We are in contact almost daily. We expect the approval this month, which means the call for applications could also be published this month,"" the minister said.

Economy Minister Matjaž Han thinks it is important that this happens as soon as possible. ""Without connectivity, there can be no good and export-oriented economy and tourists,"" he said.

Air traffic in Slovenia is only slowly recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapse of national air carrier Adria Airways in 2019.

The government is tackling the issue with this programme while also analysing the possibility of founding a new flag carrier. ""We will discuss this when thorough analyses are conducted,"" Bratušek said.

Labour Court rules in favour of prosecutors in pay cut dispute,"The Labour Court has ruled in favour of individual prosecutors who took the state to court for temporarily cutting their pay by 30% in 2020 during the Covid epidemic, Prosecutor Association head Boštjan Valenčič told the STA on Wednesday. The news comes after the Constitutional Court declared the cut unconstitutional last month.","The pay cut was in place between 11 April and 31 May 2020 as part of the first omnibus law the government adopted to tackle the consequences of the Covid pandemic.

Valenčič said that more than 50 prosecutors, including himself, had challenged the government's decision at the Labour Court.

""First rulings regarding the pay cut for persecutors have been handed down. The Labour Court has fully sided with the prosecutors, which was expected following the Constitutional Court's decision,"" he said.

All prosecutors will now receive the pay they were deprived of in 2020, so they do not have to file any claims, he added. The sum in question is around EUR 450,000 gross and will be expectedly paid out in March or April.

The Association of Prosecutors warned the provisions were unconstitutional when they were passed, and asked the Constitutional Court to review them already in April 2020.

However, the top court decided not to process the petition on the grounds that the prosecutors had not yet exhausted all available legal means.

Some of the prosecutors then turned to the Labour Court, which itself petitioned the Constitutional Court as part of its deliberation on the case. It was based on this petition that the Constitutional Court ruled the measure unconstitutional.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice']"
RTV Slovenija takes govt to court for reimbursement of labour costs,"RTV Slovenija has taken the government to court claiming EUR 24 million in compensation for higher labour costs. The government pledged to compensate the public broadcaster for the costs in the 2018 strike agreement but has failed to deliver on the promise, RTV Slovenija acting director general Andrej Grah Whatmough said on Tuesday.","Announcing the lawsuit filed on Monday, Grah Whatmough also said that since he had taken over in April 2021, he and his team had managed to stabilise the public broadcaster's finances.

By identifying redundant employees, they have managed to save EUR 5 million in labour costs, ""which no other RTV management has managed to do until now"". As a result, RTV finished 2022 without a loss for the first time, he added.

As for the broadcaster's liquidity, he said that a day after paying salaries, ""we still have EUR 3 million in our account"".

Some insiders have been warning in recent weeks that this money is the result of a sale of Eutelsat shares that the government says was unlawful.

Grah Whatmough said the broadcaster had no debt, planned no loans, while its future financial situation is ""partially in the hands of the government"".

It will be the government's ""responsibility if the public broadcaster faces bankruptcy, or the Greek scenario,"" he stressed.

Just like previous governments, the current government is not responding to the many calls to provide for stable finances, said Grah Whatmough.

He mentioned the Greek scenario in reference to MP Borut Sajovic from the ruling Freedom Movement saying on Monday that ""the incompetent RTV leadership is taking the broadcaster into bankruptcy and the Greek scenario"".

""I'd like to assure you that RTV Slovenija is facing neither bankruptcy nor the Greek scenario. At least not for now,"" said the RTV Slovenija boss.

He stressed that the government has not yet implemented the strike agreement from 2018, failing to raise the funds for labour costs despite committing to do so.

""This is why we decided, together with RTV trade unions, to take the founder [Republic of Slovenia] to court to get compensation for the costs"".

Grah Whatmough also commented on the court rulings on the basis of which the coalition parties are seeking dismissal by parliament of nine members of the RTV programme council.

The Higher Labour Court decided in March that Grah Whatmough's appointment in January 2021 was unlawful because he did not meet one of the job requirements - three years of managerial experience.

But Grah Whatmough said this requirement is not set down in the broadcaster's articles of association, which brings up the question whether the programme council can set job requirements past them. To clear this up, RTV has asked the Supreme Court to review the ruling.",labour,['labour']
Hydrogen discussed as a key factor to achieve climate goals,"A debate in Ljubljana on Tuesday heard that hydrogen is one of the key factors with which the EU member states will achieve the pursued climate goals, so it is necessary to step up related activities, with cross-border cooperation being of great help to individual countries.","Vesna Nahtigal, the director general of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS), one of the hosts of the Slovenian-German Hydrogen Day, noted that the competitiveness of industrial production in the EU was dropping in light of high energy prices.

""The only solution is to take even more decisively and quickly the path of low-carbon circular economy to achieve the green transition,"" she said at the event co-hosted by the Slovenian-German Chamber of Commerce and the German Embassy.

The debate agreed that in order to achieve this goal, more attention needs to be paid to hydrogen, in particular green hydrogen, as this is an energy source and fuel that, instead of carbon dioxide, produces water as a by-product.

Nahtigal noted that the GZS supported several hydrogen projects, including the North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project, adding that cross-border cooperation was of great help in the promotion of progress in the field of hydrogen energy.

Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Igor Papič said hydrogen technologies would help de-carbonise the power production in Slovenia, adding that the country could serve as a location for major demonstration projects in this field.

While admitting that the technology is not yet fully ready and still too expensive, Papič believes that there is still enough time to prepare it, with Slovenian and German companies being ready to cooperate in such projects.

German Ambassador Natalie Kauther said that green hydrogen was the energy of the future, noting that the German government had prepared a framework for improving hydrogen production.

Since 2021 Germany has invested more than EUR 8 billion euros in 62 hydrogen-related projects, she said, adding that Slovenia and Slovenia and Germany were on a similar path when it came to hydrogen.

Dagmar von Bohnstein, the head of the Slovenian-German Chamber of Commerce, said that the two countries could help each other in hydrogen technologies and in achieving carbon neutrality goals.

Storage of energy produced from renewable sources is meanwhile a greater challenge, which is why the chamber will host an event on this topic in March, she announced.

Stefan Wenzel, the parliamentary state secretary at the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, said there was ""no other technology for decarbonising the iron and steel industries and part of the chemical industry than hydrogen.""

Wenzel believes that hydrogen could help the EU achieve its climate goals and improve energy efficiency and security. While development of hydrogen technologies is a pan-European effort, this should be encouraged at the global level, he added.",science and technology,"['science and technology', 'environmental issue']"
Salus takes over Ljubljana rival Meditrade,"Salus, the Ljubljana-based pharmaceutical and medical equipment wholesaler, has acquired Slovenian medical equipment wholesaler Meditrade.

The acquisition of Meditrade is in line with Salus's development strategy to consolidate its role as one of the vital links in the supply of healthcare products and services in the markets of SE Europe, Salus wrote.

Salus generated just under EUR 368 million in operating income in the first nine months of 2022, 11% more than in the same period of 2021.

Reality show cameras catch arsonist,"An arsonist burnt down Monday night a wooden shed on a farm that will shortly be the filming location of a reality show of the commercial broadcaster POP TV.

He started the fire by putting two burning objects on the floor, which seems to be wet. He waited until the fire started burning and then left the shed.

If the perpetrator's objective was to prevent the filming of what will be the ninth season of the highly popular reality show, titled The Farm (Kmetija), he has failed.

Even though the shed has been completely destroyed, the shooting will start as scheduled, POP TV's online news portal 24ur.com said on Tuesday.

Number of people in need of aid from Caritas up 10% in 2022,"Ten percent more people in need turned to Caritas Slovenia last year than in 2021, its secretary general Peter Tomažič told the press on Tuesday as the Catholic charity launched a campaign dubbed Let's Help Survive and Live.","The 2022 report on the charity's website shows that more than 143,000 persons benefited from one of its programmes, of whom over 26,700 children and 35,000 elderly people.

Food aid was provided to nearly 70,000 parents with children and individuals and nearly 730 homeless people, while Caritas also helped pay bills to 17,600 elderly people, a 17% rise.

A total of EUR 11.1 million was spent on aid programmes at home and another EUR 4.4 million on aid shipped abroad, of which EUR 3.3 million went to Ukraine, said Tomažič.

Many people would like to work but once they get a job they lose all the benefits and end up financially worse off than if unemployed, he added.

Tomažič would thus like employers to set a decent pay for a well done job as a standard rather than insisting on the minimum wage.

Alenka Petek, a social worker from Caritas Ljubljana, said having a job used to be a way out of poverty, which is no longer the case.

An increasingly large number of families where both parents work turn to them for help as they find it hard to make ends meet due to high commercial rents.

Many of them apply for public rental housing but with the shortage of public homes for rent few are awarded one.

Janez Kastelic from Caritas Domžale said many people in need are afraid to ask for aid due to social stigma.

Immigrants and refugees also have a hard time, especially as they struggle with basic language skills, said Petek.

Many elderly people are also struggling on their low pensions, especially amid high inflation, and they are also socially excluded as their circle of friends is narrowing.

""They worked hard all their lives, but now they are dependent on humanitarian organisations, which often makes them feel very humiliated,"" she added.

Caritas tries to help people who are just below eligibility for other forms of state-provided aid or allowances, Tomažič said. Many of them have decent incomes, but struggle to survive because of debt, illness or other circumstances.

And with the prices of food, housing and other necessities further rising, the situation is not improving, he said.",human interest,"['social issue', 'human interest']"

Changes that facilitate employment of foreigners sent to plenary,"Legislative changes that facilitate the employment of foreigners, in particular in public healthcare and social services, and allow asylum seekers to access the labour market after three as opposed to nine months were backed on Friday by the parliamentary Committee for Labour, the Family, Social Affairs and the Disabled.","Labour Ministry State Secretary Igor Feketija told the committee members that three key changes to the act on the employment, self-employment and work of foreigners would facilitate and speed up the employment of third country citizens.

With serious workforce shortages plaguing in particular public healthcare and social services, the employment of foreign workers in the public sector will be exempt from the provisions of this law in line with one of the changes.

The main ramification is that an approval by the Employment Service will be no longer required for the employment of third country citizens in the public sector, with the government arguing the Employment Service determining their education level, language skills and qualifications was too demanding a task.

The Employment Service's approval alone and no longer also a written approval by the relevant administrative unit will on the other hand suffice for foreigners wishing to change the employer, job or be employed with several employers during the validity of their residence and work permits. Feketija explained that between 2,500 and 3,000 such consents were issued in recent years.

Moreover, in line with the changes, which are being passed at the same time as changes to the foreigners act, the period after which foreigners who have obtained asylum seeker status are able to access the labour market is being shortened from the EU-allowed maximum of nine months to three months.

The main points made during the debate on the committee included Danijel Kastelic from the upper chamber of parliament pointing out that private providers of social services that have public licences remain bound by Employment Service approval provisions. A representative of the parliament's legal service highlighted this anomaly as well.

Goran Lukič of Delavska Svetovalnica, an NGO protecting the rights of foreign workers, pointed to the general problem of protracted proceedings for acknowledging the education level of foreign workers.

A number of reservations were expressed by MPs from the ranks of the opposition Democrats (SDS), with Alenka Helbl seeing the employing of foreigners in healthcare as a temporary solution while fearing it would become a long-term one.

""We are primarily for the employment of Slovenian citizens,"" she said, while also arguing the proposed faster labour market entry of asylum seekers would lead to unfair competition. Also, double standards will be used when hiring in public institutions, and excluding administrative units from approval proceedings will open the door to abuse, Helbl argued.

Aleksander Reberšek from the opposition New Slovenia (NSi) echoed the view that more energy should be invested into getting the 20,000 Slovenian citizens currently registered as unemployment into the labour market.

Dean Premik of the ruling coalition Freedom Movement, on the other hand, argued the changes were not about lowering standards, but about ""time savings"". He added the party is aware that the law does not solve the entire problem of foreign workers' employment, and that additional measures will be needed in the future - especially in the areas of housing, wage policy and the quality of life of foreign workers.

Miha Kordiš of the junior coalition Left party said that the changes ""not only reduce the burden on the administrative units, but also make it at least a little easier for people to actually change employers"", which also reduces foreign workers' exposure to pay dumping and other abuses.

As for the asylum seekers, he stressed that under the new law, ""they will finally be able to build their lives and get back on their feet as productive members of society, not as a minority"" locked up in asylum centres.",labour,"['labour', 'politics', 'social issue']"
Anti-graft commission says health minister behaved unethically,"The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption spoke on Monday of the incumbent health minister having failed to honour the highest standards of integrity in one of his exchanges with the doctors' trade union. While arguing additional procedures were not called for, it urged clearer government rules for addressing ethics code breaches.","The anti-graft commission conducted a preliminary examination procedure after receiving in November a complaint about Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan for allegedly pressuring the doctors' trade union.

Fides, the trade union of doctors and dentists, accused Bešič Loredan of demanding of its top negotiator Gregor Zemljič in a phone call to sign a deal the government had offered to the union in pay talks amid a looming threat of a strike.

The minister allegedly told Zemljič he had been given ""orders from the prime minister that in case of a strike announcement and actual strike an all-out war be waged against doctors and Fides with the aim of isolating and exhausting them"".

Bešič Loredan confirmed having the phone conversation with Zemljič: ""It was a private call from a surgeon to an internist and yes, I got carried away by emotions."" He denied making threats.

In a fresh response today, the minister said that he had apologised on several occasions, including to the public, and that he ""was still a bit naive at the time"". ""This was a lesson and I have learned something. We talked it over with the prime minister and since then my actions have been crystal clear.""

While Zemljič, who is also deputy chairman of Fides, said it had not been the union which filed the anti-graft watchdog complaint, Fides did file a complaint against the minister with the government secretariat general.

The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption has pointed out that it is the government that is primarily in charge of dealing with suspected violations of the ethics code by government officials and that the government responded and took a stance in the given case. Thus the commission sees no reasons to pursue its own procedure.

The anti-graft watchdog did underline the government's response, also arguing that communicating in this manner fell short of the highest standards of integrity.

Prime Minister Robert Golob had said after talking the situation through with Bešič Loredan that the minister continued to enjoy his support. The PM's office told the minister that his calls were never private but he always made them in his capacity as deputy prime minister and health minister.

Golob added that all government officials were expected to communicate with the external as well as internal public in a respectful and professional manner, the commission pointed out.

It is the watchdog's duty to issue recommendations if integrity violations are identified, the commission added. It assessed the procedure for the government and ministries to deal with breaches of ethics codes as being poorly defined. There need to be provisions defining the time-frame for dealing with suspected breaches and, in particular, specific sanctions to be imposed in the event of breaches, the commission said.","crime, law and justice",['politics']
"EU ministerial: Slovenia supports stronger borders without fences, okays Green Deal plan","Arriving at a ministerial in Brussels, Foreign Ministry State Secretary Marko Štucin said Slovenia is in favour of strengthening the EU's external borders, but opposed to erecting fences. He moreover welcomed the Green Deal Industrial Plan, while noting Slovenia was in favour of greater flexibility in state aid rules in particular.","With migrations among the topics of Monday's EU's General Affairs Council meeting, Štucin said the Western Balkans migration route was a key security matter for Slovenia. ""Slovenia is opposed to the building of fences and walls, but on the other hand we need to strengthen the EU's external borders,"" he said.

This also applies to the border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has become an external border of the Schengen area. According to Štucin, Slovenia is particularly in favour of the European External and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) actively participating in the protection of this border.

Strengthened protection of this border is important for tackling the migration issue in a broader sense and also for restoring the normal functioning of Schengen without internal border controls, Štucin added.

Austria has been carrying out such controls on its border with Slovenia since 2015 and Štucin pointed out that in recent months the European Commission has also noted that the reasons for surveillance at the Slovenian-Austrian border are not always justified, which has moreover been underlined by the EU Court of Justice.

""I sincerely hope that we will get a solution that goes in the direction of abolishing border controls between Austria and Slovenia. It is too early to talk about what it will be"", he said.

Meanwhile, as for the the Green Deal Industrial Plan, presented last week by the European Commission, Štucin said ""Slovenia is content this first document"", while adding the debate on the plan is really only just starting.

Slovenia is in favour of greater flexibility in the rules on state aid, but without interfering too much in the internal market. This means that state aid must be time-limited and targeted, but at the same time it must help businesses, the state secretary said.

""In this situation, our main fear is that the larger multinationals will move from Europe to, for example, the US,"" explained Štucin and argued for an EU-based solution.

In the short term, the aid will probably have to come from existing European funds, while Slovenia also supports the discussion on a longer-term solution and a possible new fund to help business, including through joint borrowing.

A consultation on the modernisation of state aid rules was launched as the European Commission presented the plan. According to unofficial information, Commission President Margrethe Vestager will discuss the topic with Economy Minister Matjaž Han via video link this afternoon.",politics,"['environmental issue', 'politics']"
Roglič is the winner of stage 17 at Vuelta a Espana,"Primož Roglič (Jumbo Visma) won stage 17 at the Vuelta a Espana on Wednesday to retain his 3rd place overall, after winning stage 8 as well. After the 120km route from Ribadesella to the top of Alto de L'Angliru, Roglič was followed by two Jumbo-Visma riders, Jonas Vingegaard from Denmark and Sepp Kuss from the US, who kept the red jersey.","The Jumbo-Visma team dictated the pace most of the time with Team Bahrain Victorious coming out strong in the penultimate ascent. Wout Poels from the Netherlands crushed most of the group in the steepest part of the hill and Enric Mas and Juan Ayuso from Spain quickly gave in.

Less than three kilometres before the finish line, Roglič stepped up and slowly moved away from his rivals. He was later joined by just Vingegaard and Kuss but the latter then let up.

""There were no tactics, it was very hard and steep on the last climb. When I attacked, I had my own rhythm and then the climb will tell who is first, second and so on,"" said the 33-year-old Roglič.

""I let them dictate the rhythm as long as I felt they were going fast enough. But when the speed dropped, I told myself that I would try my own rhythm,"" said the Slovenian about his waiting for the right moment in the race.

This is Roglič's 79th career win, and 14th this season. He won the Spanish Grand Tour in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and he won the Giro d'Italia and the Tirreno-Adriatico, Catalonia and Burgos races this year.

On Thursday, riders will take on the challenging stage 18 from Pola de Allande to La Cruz de Linares (178.9km).",sport,['sport']
Šinko discusses challenges of bioeconomy in Stockholm,"EU agriculture ministers discussed bioeconomy, a priority of the Swedish EU presidency, at their informal meeting in Stockholm on Tuesday. Slovenia's Irena Šinko said introducing a circular economy brings big challenges and calls for cooperation across the entire society. She also held a bilateral meeting with her French counterpart.","As for meeting long-term goals in sectors based on land use, Šinko said the food and forestry sectors as well as the entire economy are faced with big challenges as they introduce circular economy.

""The bioeconomy goes well beyond the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and its implementation will require synergies across society,"" she said, pointing out that member states have different starting positions.

The scope of agricultural land and its production capacity are limited, while society must preserve this capacity, said Šinko, stressing that countries with little agricultural land per capita are very well aware of this.

She believes ""we need to achieve better integration and effectiveness of the different EU policies while making citizens aware of the benefits of the bioeconomy"", which requires complex changes and time to get implemented.

Ministers also discussed ways to realise the potential of the agriculture and forestry sector in the green transition. Šinko stressed there is no magic tool to strike a balance between climate neutrality, biodiversity, rural development, the nutritional value of food and feed, and energy use in production and transport.

She believes that EU-level strategies such as the Green Deal, the Fork to Fork Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Forestry Strategy are important in terms of setting the framework and overall goals.

However, the CAP is and will remain crucial for agriculture and rural development, where member states must be given the flexibility to choose how they act, what they want to achieve and the steps they need to take in order to achieve them, said the minister, stressing there are far too many administrative hurdles in the current system.

In a meeting with her French counterpart Marc Fesneau, Šinko discussed honey labelling, new genetic technologies, and the situation on the market. Fesneau accepted her invitation to a conference on food chains in Slovenia in October, the Agriculture Ministry said in a press release.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Judicial Association opposes constitutional amendments,The Judicial Association has expressed opposition to amendments to the Constitution that would partially change the Judicial Council's composition and were recently endorsed by the special parliamentary commission in charge of changing the Constitution.,"Under the proposed amendment, the Judicial Council would expand from 11 members it has now to 15. Seven would be elected by parliament with a two-thirds majority of the MPs present at the session and eight members would come from the ranks of judges.

At the same time, judges would no longer be appointed by parliament, but by the president of Slovenia, to depoliticise the procedure.

The Judicial Association said on Monday the removal of judicial appointments from parliament was good, but the whole package is ""unsuitable"" insofar as it changes the composition of the judicial council.

The judges would retain a majority, but the Supreme Court president would be a member automatically as well. Moreover, non-judges would be proposed by political parties, which could cause ""irreparable politicisation of staffing in the judiciary,"" it said.","crime, law and justice","['crime, law and justice', 'politics']"
Campaign launched to promote Slovenia's business post-floods,The investment promotion agency Spirit Slovenija in cooperation with its partners launched on Monday a PR campaign to promote Slovenia as a safe business destination in the wake of extreme floods that hit the country in early August.,"Together with the economy and foreign ministries and the Government Communication Office, the agency will inform the business community abroad of the situation in the Slovenian economy and flood relief measures.

Providing information on how companies are faring in the wake of the floods, the campaign aims to underline that a large part of the country's economy is running smoothly, Spirit Slovenija said in a press release.

""The key message of the joint PR campaign is that there is business as usual in most of the Slovenian economy after the floods and that the Slovenian business ecosystem is safe and open for business. Foreign companies wishing to invest in or do business with Slovenian companies are therefore very welcome and appreciated,"" reads the press release.

The government has taken a number of measures to help companies that have suffered damage in the floods to get their business back on track as quickly as possible, the agency added, which Economy Minister Matjaž Han echoed in his statement that underlined how rapid and tangible the measures have been.

He called on foreign business partners and clients to continue cooperating with flood-stricken Slovenian companies and refrain from seeking alternative suppliers.

""Foreign investments and business of foreign-owned companies is welcome, appreciated and safe in Slovenia,"" he said.

The Economy Ministry cooperates with foreign business chambers that have representative offices in Slovenia in drafting the measures, Spirit Slovenija said.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Ljubljana Festival to open with tribute to Tomaž Domicelj,"The 71st Ljubljana Festival will bring to the capital an eclectic mix of performances between 20 June and 3 September, opening with a concert in Congress Square that will pay tribute to Tomaž Domicelj, a singer-songwriter and translator who has left a mark on the Slovenian pop scene during his 57-year career.","Summer Night, the opening concert of the largest summer festival in the country, will bring 22 of Domicelj's songs sung by him and another 21 singers, from Alenka Godec and Jan Plestenjak to Helena Blagne and Hamo.

They will be accompanied by public broadcaster RTV Slovenija's Symphonic Orchestra, the Big Band and the youth choir and the conductor Patrik Greblo.

Domicelj said his being 75 and having a 57-year career are interesting numbers, but he will not be the oldest singer on the stage, which will be Alfi Nipič.

Two days after the opening concert, Križanke will host Slovenian choreographer Edward Clug's rendition of Carmina Burana, which premiered to critical acclaim in 2021.

In early July the same venue will host the musical Beauty and the Beast by Croatia's Komedija Theatre from Zagreb. Its manager Miljenko Puljić said they first appeared at the Ljubljana Festival in 1954, but this time they are here with the theatre's biggest and most expensive production.

Spanish theatre group La Fura dels Baus is returning to Ljubljana, this time with two productions in late June - the world premiere of To Be or Not to Be, and Pastoral for the Planet, inspired by Beethoven's music.

Ljubljana's Mini Teater will play Who Is Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, directed by Ivica Buljan, while the Anton Podbevšek Teater from Novo Mesto will play The Ravishing of Lol Stein at the Božidar Jakac Gallery in Kostanjevica na Krki, south-east Slovenia.

The festival will also see performances and concerts by the Milan Scala, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouworkest Orchestra from Amsterdam, Russian soprano Anna Netrebko and tenor Yusif Eyvazov, among others.

On a lighter note, there will be film scores from the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings Series, the musicals Mamma Mia! and The Water Man, and an homage to rock greats Pink Floyd.

Slovenia-based route of Slavic women writers receives CoE certificate,"The Women Writers Route, which features authors from six Slavic countries, has officially received the certificate of the Cultural Route of the Council of Europe (CoE). The document was handed to the association Women Writers Route by Stefano Dominioni, director of the European Institute of Cultural Routes, at an event in Ljubljana on Tuesday.","The route showcases early 20th century women writers from Slovenia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Poland, Russia and Serbia.

Slovenia's representatives are writer Zofka Kveder (1878-1926) and poets Lili Novy (1885-1958) and Ljubka Šorli (1910-1993).

The project was launched six years ago at the initiative of the Forum of Slavic Cultures, an international organisation based in Ljubljana.

At the end of 2020, the cultural and tourist association Women Writers Route (Pot Pisateljic) was registered in Ljubljana, bringing together 15 partner organisations, some of them from Slovenia.

The route is the first of the Council of Europe's 48 cultural routes based in Slovenia.

It aims to present the works and lives of European women writers through inspiring activities, while boosting academic, cultural and touristic research of women's literature.

Addressing the ceremony in the parliament, National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič said that writers ""were often smart, strong and intelligent women"".

""Centuries ago, those who stood out in one way or another were labelled and persecuted as witches. Later, they were locked up behind four walls and silenced in various ways.""

Despite the times hostile to women, feminine strength and the desire for equality gave these women strength to persevere through literature ""in the seemingly hopeless struggle for gender equality"".

Klakočar Zupančič is convinced that it is thanks to their efforts and courage ""that we have today so many positive changes in art and in society"".

MP Tamara Vonta, chair of the Slovenian delegation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, highlighted in her address ""the three magnificent Slovenian women that we encounter on the Women Writers Route"", citing a few thoughts or verses from their works.

From Kveder's legacy, she chose the sentence: ""It is important for women to be independent, to have their own means of subsistence, to have the right to pursue their aspirations in their professional and private lives.""

The ceremony was attended by representatives of the six participating countries, including Andreja Rihter, chair of the association and president of the Forum of Slavic Cultures, and Špela Spanžel from the Slovenian Culture Ministry.

Pianist Aleksandra Naumovski Potisk and soprano Martina Burger performed songs based on the poems written by 19th century Slovenian women poets.","arts, culture and entertainment","['arts, culture and entertainment', 'social issue']"
Slovenia's foreign trade of goods remains robust,"Slovenia exported EUR 4.8 billion worth of goods in November, a rise of 29.7% from the same month a year ago, as imports of goods rose by 21.1% to EUR 4.8 billion, fresh figures from the Statistics Office (SURS) show. The export-import ratio hit 99.9%, as the country generated a EUR 3 million deficit.","Compared to November 2021, the value of exports to EU markets was up by 11.7% to EUR 2.8 billion and the value of imports by 12.7% to EUR 3 billion.

The value of external trade with non-EU countries also increased, with exports rising by nearly 69% to EUR 2 billion and imports by over 34% to EUR 1.8 billion.

In the first eleven months of 2022, the value of external trade was higher than in the same period in 2021 - exports rose by 34.9% to EUR 48.9 billion and imports by 40% to EUR 52.2 billion.

External trade deficit in this period amounted to EUR 3.4 billion, putting the export-import ratio at 93.6%.

Exports to EU member states increased by over 24% to EUR 30 billion, with imports from these countries up just over 28% to EUR 31.4 billion.

Exports to third markets increased by almost 56% to EUR 18.9 billion and imports rose by nearly 63% to EUR 20.8 billion.","economy, business and finance","['economy, business and finance']"
Minister announces solution for health insurance premium this month,"After insurer Generali announced that its monthly premium of top-up health insurance will go up by almost a third as of 1 May and other insurers are expected to follow suit, Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan met with the three insurers' representatives on Thursday. He announced a solution by 1 May to prevent premium rises.","While the Insurance Supervision Agency said today that the top-up health insurance premiums were last raised in 2019, so the move had been expected, given the rising costs, the minister assessed the move was unjustified, so he invited the three private providers of top-up health insurance for a meeting today.

Bešič Loredan said the officials told him that the EUR 74 million of funds set aside for health services in an emergency law have been ""virtually all spent"" according to their calculations.

Generali was the first to realise this so given the expected productivity, which has been rising and exceeding or at least catching up with the 2019 level it is expected that their input will need to be increasingly higher than the premiums collected, the minister said.

This is why the insurer announced it will raise its monthly premium by more than 10 euro from the current EUR 34.50 as of 1 May, which the minister still finds unjustified. He said a detailed financial analysis would be made, ""but we have already determined that costs in the health system have gone up significantly, by a lot more than we thought"".

Today's meeting was about ""facing facts"", the minister said, announcing next round of talks for next Thursday. The government will also be looking for solutions, he asserted.

""We need to side with the people. The fact is that a 10 euro rise is too much for many people,"" he said. He also warned that if all three insurers raised their premiums by an equal amount, this could lead to people no longer paying for supplementary health insurance.

The ministry expects monthly reports from the insurers on their spending. ""It'll probably take some time, but everything will be clear by 1 May,"" he said.

""It is good that there is interest on all sides that the premium rise does not happen. But it is hard to say at this point how we will do it,"" he said.

According to the minister, efforts for abolishing the top-up insurance altogether will also continue. He said it was possible that it would be abolished earlier than planned, which is on 1 January 2025.

The Insurance Supervision Agency said today that in line with a 2012 EU Court ruling, a decision on a premium rise is a business decision of insurers and must not be approved by a regulator.",health,['health']
Suspended prison sentences for Mirko and Tanja Tuš upheld,"The Celje Higher Court has largely upheld the first-instance ruling for Mirko Tuš and Tanja Tuš, the once powerful spouses who pleaded guilty of abuse of office and money laundering when selling the brands Tušmobil and Tuš Telekom, according to the newspaper Dnevnik.","The case concerns the transfer between 2011 and 2016 of the mobile telephony brands that was reported by creditors as an attempted fraud.

After pleading guilty, the couple received suspended prison sentences and were fined more half a million euros in June 2022.

The husband, who founded and used to head the once sprawling Tuš retail and entertainment empire, got two years with a three-year probation period and the wife one year with two-year probation.

The Celje District Court, a first-instance court, also ordered Mirko Tuš to pay over a period of two years a fine of EUR 450,000 and Tanja Tuš that of EUR 90,000.

However, last May, the Higher Court deliberated on a complaint by the company Tuš Holding and by SIB Bank, partly annulling only the amount of the couple's personal assets to be seized, as each would have to let go of just over EUR 121,000.

The Celje District Court will now have to decide on this amount again, its president Petra Giacomelli told the newspaper Dnevnik on Wednesday.

The distribution of the seized assets meanwhile remains unchanged and is also final.

""This means that from the entire sum of EUR 35.45 million, EUR 29 million goes to Tuš Holding and the remaining EUR 6.45 million to the national budget,"" said Giacomelli.

The decision on returning the brands to Engrotuš and on the court fees also remains unchanged.

Tuš Holding is 100% owned by Mirko Tuš, while the spouses hold a 20% stake in Engrotuš. Their highly leveraged empire entered bankruptcy protection in 2014 after an aggressive expansion and has since been sold off piece by piece. It used to consist of a network of companies that included the retail chain Tuš, a chain of multiplex cinemas and a virtual mobile operator.",education,"['crime, law and justice']"
Primorske endorses language requirement for family reunification,"Commenting on the changes to the foreigners act that introduce the requirement of basic language proficiency for family members of foreigners working in Slovenia, Primorske Novice endorses the new provision and criticises the Left and NGOs that oppose it.","""The claim by the Left and certain NGOs is surprising; the assumption that such a requirement is damaging to immigrants, discriminates against them, makes it difficult for them to integrate or even makes it impossible to reunite with their families is surprising and difficult to understand,"" the paper says.

One would expect NGOs to take the opposite view and endeavour to make integration more successful, and that starts with the learning of the local language. One would expect that they will demand of the state to put in place integration programmes. Instead, the complex challenge of integrating immigrants is up to occasional EU-funded projects and the good will of volunteers and workers in schools and educational institutions.

""If we demand that someone learns the basics of the language of a country they have chosen to live and work in, even if just temporarily, this has nothing to do with nationalism, intolerance or xenophobia. On the contrary, it shows there is realisation that social exclusion must be addressed comprehensively before it is too late,"" concludes the commentary Slovenian Requirement as a Good-for-Nothing.",social issue,['social issue']
