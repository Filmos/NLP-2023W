Delo comments on internal dynamics of parliamentary parties,"The two biggest parties, the Democrats (SDS) and the Freedom Movement seem to be the most stable of all. Both are behemoths on their sides of the political spectrum, as the society once again becomes increasingly torn along ideological lines.

Meanwhile, the SDS's second in commands, Anže Logar, is launching a path to the central field. His chances to make it in the next election, which is still three years away, are not very good.

If he comes off as a satellite of the SDS, he does not stand much chance of making it into the National Assembly. But if he cuts the cord from SDS, the party will torpedo his project before it even begins.

The best, albeit highly unlikely, scenario for Slovenia's democracy would be Logar taking over the SDS, Delo says under the headline If Logar Cut the Cord.

New Slovenia (NSi) is meanwhile barely surviving in the shadow of the SDS and those higher up the party ranks would willingly sacrifice leader Matej Tonin for at least a slight uptick of the polls.

On the other side of the isle, Jani Prednik is launching an attempts to become the head of the Social Democrats (SD), as many in the party have come to realise that its leader Tanja Fajon would become vulnerable if Slovenia fails to win the election for non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council.

Meanwhile, Miha Kordiš has just launched an activist wing of the Left, claiming that the party had been hijacked for career purposes of its leader Luka Mesec and his clique.",politics,politics
Voice of the People unhappy with coalition party leaders,"The group held a similar pre-election discussion in April 2022, where all three presidents of the coalition parties were in attendance, so it had expected them to attend today's post-election discussion as well.

Voice of the People wanted the coalition leaders to express their commitments directly to the people in a live, open and public space, so that people can ask them questions directly.

To show its disappointment, Voice of the People has written an open letter to Freedom Movement leader Robert Golob, Social Democrats (SD) president Tanja Fajon and leader of the Left and Luka Mesec.

The letter states that the three officials changed their minds about attending the meeting ""at the last minute"" and decided that the deputy group leaders would attend instead.

The letter states that a meeting with the deputy group leaders is welcome, ""but it cannot be a substitute for a meeting"" with Golob, Fajon and Mesec, who made certain commitments to the voters in their pre-election debates.

Voice of the People also pointed out that this post-election discussion is important in creating a continuous dialogue between the people and their government, which is an essential part of the democratic process.

The group is now inviting the coalition leaders to a new discussion on 20 September.",politics,politics

"Golob, Bettel agree all EU candidates should be treated equally (adds)","""Enlargement was a technical issue for 20 years, meaning being virtually left to the European Commission and the fulfilment of technical criteria. The view has changed somewhat due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the process is becoming an increasingly geopolitical issue,"" Golob said at a joint press conference with Bettel.

He added that Slovenia was in touch with the European Commission in order to clearly present its position - that the Western Balkans should be treated equally or similarly to Ukraine and Moldova when it comes to EU enlargement.

The Slovenian prime minister noted that several other EU member states agreed with such a position, while adding that, in addition to the technical conditions, the geopolitical reality must also be taken into account.

""We do not want the Western Balkans to suddenly become hostage to some foreign forces just because the Commission has not been paying attention,"" Golob said.

Bettel agreed that all countries that wish to join the EU should be treated equally, while nevertheless emphasising more the importance of compliance with the conditions.

""The rules are the same for everyone and I will insist on that,"" he said, adding that there was no system that would bypass the rules and enable faster accession.

Thus, Bettel said regarding support for the start of talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina, for which Golob called for in a recent letter to European Council President Charles Michel, that he would wait for the European Commission's report.

The Commission is expected to present an enlargement report, in which it analyses whether the candidate countries have met the various required conditions, in October.

The Slovenian and Luxembourg prime ministers also talked at the meeting about the war in Ukraine and business cooperation, especially in space technologies.

They then travelled to Schengen, a village in Luxembourg where the Schengen Agreement was signed in 1985 to abolish border controls among several EU member states.

The prime minister noted the importance of preserving the Schengen Area and free movement, which Bettel described as a great achievement. ""If we want Schengen to work, its external borders must also work,"" he said.

Golob said that Slovenia advocated for the full functioning of the Schengen Area, whose members should act responsibly at the external borders, while at the same time being aware of the benefits it brought.

He reiterated Slovenia's criticism of Austria repeatedly extending checks at the border with Slovenia.

Bettel also noted the importance of an area without border control for the economic development, which is one of the key topics of today's visit of the Slovenian prime minister.

There has been progress since Bettel's visit to Slovenia in February, Golob said, noting space technologies, where the two countries will improve cooperation by signing a memorandum on the sidelines of the Slovenia-Luxembourg business forum.

""We expect a lot from this, because Luxembourg is a sort of a pioneer in this field, and our industry is also keeping up with the pace of development in some niche areas,"" he said.

Golob believes that Slovenia and Luxembourg together will be able to create a ""success story at the European level as well"".

The business forum will also feature tourism, wood processing and furniture companies, and the direct air link between the countries' capitals, to be launched on Thursday by Luxair, the flag carrier of Luxembourg, will be presented.",politics,politics
Diplomatic charity bazaar in Ljubljana brings together 48 embassies,"Around 60 stands were put in Stritar Street and in front of the Town Hall to present the participating countries and their traditional products, which could be purchased by visitors.

At its stand, the SILA association offered ""bags of happiness"" for a symbolic price. These were prepared with the help of donations from various companies and with representatives of the countries participating in the bazaar.

Like every year, the entire proceeds will be donated to charity. This year, the collected funds will be allocated to various organisations and part of the funds also to the families affected by the August floods.

The event was opened in front of the Robba Fountain by SILA president Lali Sladjana Ilić and Chinese Ambassador Wang Shunqing.

""I'm happy and proud that China is the guest of honour this year,"" said Wang, thanking the SILA association for organising the event and other embassies and communities for participating and contributing to the event.

The Chinese embassy hosted a special event, a lion dance, performed by children in traditional clothes to the sounds of Chinese music. They were joined by children from sport clubs and Ljubljana and international primary schools.

SILA was established in November 1993 by a group of spouses of Slovenian ambassadors and business executives when foreign diplomatic representation offices started opening in Ljubljana after Slovenia gained independence.

They were soon joined by spouses of foreign ambassadors, business executives and members of the academia.","arts, culture and entertainment",social issue
EUR 11 per share offered in Datalab takeover bid,"Together with persons with whom it acts in concert, the group interested in Datalab already controls 70.51% of the Slovenian IT company.

Apart from Datalab founder and CEO Mertelj, these persons are Datalab's present management and employees, who are also shareholders.

Datalab announced the intention of the group of international investors, led by seasoned Slovenian IT manager Simon Kaluža, to acquire the company in early July.

The takeover bid applies to 645,848 of a total of almost 2.19 million Datalab shares that the persons acting with the bidder do not already own.

Rucio, represented by Kenneth Flanagan and Sebastien Denis, will consider its bid successful if it manages to acquire 80% of all shares, that is around 1.75 million.

Rucio and Mertelj signed on 4 July an agreement on a joint takeover with the persons who already own some of the shares.

The agreement says that Rucio will provide funds for the payment of shares, and acquire all shares subject to takeover when the takeover is completed.

It also allows new Datalab shareholders to transfer minority shareholders onto Rucio and buy them out, and to withdraw Datalab from the stock market.

Datalab Tehnologije shares are traded on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange in the standard market. The last deal with its shares was made on 25 July at EUR 12.20 apiece.

When the group of investors announced its intention for the takeover on 7 July, Datalab said that Kaluža would be appointed as a new member of Datalab's management board.

He has 30 years of experience in IT, having worked for the former Ljubljana IT company Hermes Softlab and the German ICT giant SAP.

Kaluža expressed last month strong trust in Datalab's sustainable growth and potential, while stressing that forces will be joined with Mertelj, ""who has incredible industry knowledge and visionary leadership"".

With 25 years of experience, Datalab is best known for its enterprise resource planning system Pantheon, which it lauds as the leading product of this kind in the region.",labour,labour
Govt approves additional EUR 26m for sustainable heating,"The Government Communications Office(UKOM) said that the value of the project is increasing due to increased needs and benefits of the measure in the field of renewables. The implementation period will not change.

The project is funded by the Climate Change Fund and encourages the use of renewables in heating by replacing outdated small inefficient furnaces with new ones fired by wood biomass or heat pumps. Indirectly, the project aims to improve the quality of air.

""In the long term this will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of air, which is one of the environmental problems that is harmful to human health, while long-term exposure to poor quality air can lead to an earlier death for vulnerable groups,"" the government said.",environmental issue,environmental issue
Tour of Slovenia gets under way,"Pogačar, 24, will miss out on this year's iteration due to his wrist injury and consequently delayed preparations for the Tour de France, which will get under way in less than three weeks. The Slovenian cycling star has so far won two Tour de France titles and two Tour of Slovenia titles.

Another two-time Tour of Slovenia winner, Primož Roglič, will also skip this year's race, and in their absence, the pool of favourites will be bigger. Pogačar's team UAE Team Emirates bets on Slovenia's Domen Novak and Italy's Diego Ulissi, who has two Tour of Slovenia titles and aims to get a record third.

UAE Team Emirates will be one of four participating teams that are at UCI WorldTeam level, others being Bahrain Victorious, Bora-Hansgrohe and Jayco-AlUla.

Riding for Bahrain Victorious, among favourites for stage wins is Slovenia's Matej Mohorič, whereas Dutch rider Wout Poels is seen as the team's candidate for the overall victory.

Other likely favourites are Irishman Eddie Dunbar (Jayca AlUla) and Dutch and Italian riders Ide Schelling and Giovanni Aleotti (Bora-Hansgrohe). Riding for Jayca AlUla, Luka Mezgec is another Slovenian vying to bag stage wins.

A total of 140 riders, including some 30 Slovenians, are expected to take part in the race.

Starting in Celje, a town in eastern Slovenia, the first stage will end in the spa resort of Rogaška Slatina. Stage 2 will take the riders from Žalec to Ormož in the north-east of the country, whereas stage 3, the most tailored to sprinters' preferences, will run from Grosuplje to Postojna in southwestern Slovenia.

What will take place next is the only mountain stage of the Tour of Slovenia, a ride from Ljubljana to Kobarid that will feature a climb with 9.5% gradient. The final stage will kick off in Vrhnika and end in Novo Mesto in the south-east. Right before the finish line the riders will face a 2.3-km ascent with an average gradient of 9.6% and segments where steepness will exceed 20%.

Altogether, the riders will have to conquer some 833 kilometres and climb 9,134 vertical metres.

The Tour of Slovenia falls under the second highest rating category according to UCI Pro race classifications. All stages will be broadcast by TV Slovenija 2 and Eurosport.

The race will be televised in more than 130 countries in what is an opportunity to promote Slovenia's tourism, Tour of Slovenia director Bogdan Fink recently said. In the past five years of its partnership with Eurosport, the race has been watched by more than 46 million viewers worldwide.",sport,sport
Govt to refund fines issued for breaking Covid-19 restrictions,"This is one of the important steps in rebuilding trust in the rule of law as one of the fundamental constitutional principles, ""which was significantly undermined by the use of excessive and unconstitutional repression ... during the Covid-19 epidemic"", the minister said.

She noted the Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional several provisions of the law on communicable diseases and the law on public assembly, based on which the previous government adopted decrees which were the legal basis for infraction proceedings.

The decision on halting the infraction proceedings was made based on an analysis of the legal bases used in the proceedings related to the violations of Covid-19 measures.

Between 7 March 2020 and 30 May 2022 a little more than 62,000 infraction proceedings were launched unconstitutionally and the fines issued totalled EUR 5.7 million. About 30% or just over EUR 1.7 million has been paid or recovered, while the rest is in the process of being recovered, Švarc Pipan said.

The bill, which will be processed in parliament in a regular procedure, envisages halting all ongoing infraction proceedings, halting the recovery of fines as well as refunding the fines issued and the costs of procedures. The refund will not be subject to tax.

The legal consequences of the offences are also to be remedied by automatically deleting the data from all records.

The minister said that the government was aware that the Janez Janša government was faced with great uncertainty in the face of the Covid outbreak and that it had to act quickly. This is why the Slovenian constitutional order allows in such exceptional cases for the government to adopt temporary measures directly interfering with the freedom of movement and the right to assembly and association, in order to contain the spread of an infectious disease and thus effectively protect other human rights, she said.

""However, and this is crucial, such regulation must be consistent with the fundamental postulates of the constitutional order and the rule of law, such as legality, legal certainty and the predictability of the legal order. A crisis cannot and must not be an excuse to undermine them"", she concluded.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
CoE's observers of 2022 local elections propose some improvements,"The delegation of the Congress of Regional and Local Authorities says in its report that the very decentralised electoral commissions carried out the elections very professionally, transparently and efficiently, and that election day was very calm.

Despite several elections taking place in 2022 in Slovenia, the campaign was mainly focused on local issues and competitive, and election day was very peaceful, transparent and efficiently managed from opening to closing and counting.

Despite the generally positive assessment, the report points to several areas where improvement is needed, including taking steps to make the number of voters per polling station more equally distributed across the country and having more uniform rules on sealing the ballot boxes, which should be more clearly marked.

Measures should also be taken to balance the strong advantage of incumbent mayors in the election race, while rules on financing the election campaign should be revised to increase allowed funding per candidate, as low funding could encourage them to seek ""creative"" sources of funds.

The report urges including more women in local government to increase the low number of female mayors and members of local councils, while it acknowledges that progress has been made in recent years.

As for ethnic communities, the report says the Hungarian and Italian minorities enjoy a relatively high level of rights, while the Roma community, which is bigger yet territorially more dispersed, only enjoys political representation at local level, not at national level.

The Slovenian authorities are urged to continue the discussion to expand the status of ethnic communities to more communities, pointing to the Roma community as the biggest but not well represented, while also highlighting ethnic groups from former Yugoslav republics and a small German-speaking community.",politics,politics

STA journalist short-listed for science journalism award,"Udovč, who has been dedicating herself to science journalism for over eight years, previously worked at the N1 Slovenija news portal and currently heads the STA's video service, established in May.

Her journalistic work includes interviews and in-depth stories on topics ranging from medicine, astrophysics, technology, energy, neuroscience, environment, biology to history, geography and gender.

She has interviewed some of the most prominent names in science, including Nobel Prize laureates Stanley Whittingham, John C. Mather, and Rainer Weiss, Vinton Cerf, dubbed the ""father of the Internet"", and astronaut Chris Hadfield.

Udovč was nominated for the award also in 2018 and in the same year she received the Watchdog Award for best young journalist given out by the Slovenian Association of Journalists.

She is also a guest lecturer at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana and at the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School.

The European Science Journalist of the Year Award was established in 2014 by the Association of British Science Writers, and since 2020 it has been handed out annually by the European Federation for Science Journalism with the support of the global information and analytics provider Elsevier.

As journalists from all over Europe are nominated by local science journalism associations and individuals, Udovč was nominated by the Balkan Network of Science Journalists.

The other two finalists are Daniel Bolcso, a journalist and editor at the Hungarian web portal Telex.hu, and Niki Korteweg, a science journalist with the Dutch newspaper NRC.

Past winners come from Slovenia, Croatia, Germany, Spain, Russia, the Netherlands and the UK.

Govt approves changes to second track investment programme (adds),"""Trains will drive on the track in the first half of 2026 based on a temporary operating permit or decision,"" said the Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek.

The project will finish at the end of 2025, followed by two quarters to correct any errors, Bratušek said at a press conference after the government session on Thursday.

The project will cost less than what was planned in 2019, despite the increased costs of materials, noted Bratušek, saying that in 2019 the project was estimated at EUR 1.15 billion.

The price tag is in fact lower than the first estimate, but it is 18% higher than set down in the first revision of the investment programme in 2021.

This is the second change of the investment programme and the ministry says it was necessary because of higher prices of inputs, the deadline for completion, and the decision not to involve inland countries as investors.

Previous estimates by the company managing the project 2TDK were that work would be finalised at the end of March 2026. The first draft of the changes to the investment programme envisaged the same deadline but did not get government approval.

The estimates along with an increased investment value of the project were given in March by the previous management of 2TDK, which was denied discharge of liability by the government and was subsequently replaced, with Matej Oset named new director general in place of Pavle Hevka.

Posavje region on high alert due to swollen Sava,"A warning siren rang through the town of Brežice at approximately 4pm to warn citizens that the local hydro power station has opened sluice gates to battle the floods.

Bogdan Barbič, director of the company HESS, which is in charge of the hydroelectric plants in the region, told the STA that all of them had done the same to allow the Sava to run freely.

Given that the river's flow has reached 3,700 cubic metres per second and is still rising, the situation is alarming, he added.

Teams at the hydro power stations are on alert, and what may further aggravate the situation is the water levels of the Krka River, which joins the Sava, the country's longest river, in Brežice.

The risk of flooding will be at its greatest around midnight, particularly in the Brežice area. The Sava's swelling waters may reach record levels.

Citizens have been urged to leave the local areas most prone to flooding, and rescue and relief authorities are on standby. Brežice Mayor Ivan Molan has expressed concerns that certain villages or areas may be flooded.

Meanwhile, the situation at the Krško nuclear power plant is stable and under control. The swollen Sava has so far posed no threat to the plant, the authorities told the STA.

Late in the afternoon, the plant did declare an abnormal event in line with established protocols, informing the Nuclear Safety Administration of this.

""The Sava's levels are still not high enough to jeopardise the Krško plant,"" Tomaž Nemec from the administration told the STA, confirming that the plant was operating safely. The river's levels are expected to start dropping after midnight, he added.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
Bled hosting Winter Swimming World Championships,"Most competitors come from Finland, the UK, Germany and Denmark, but there are participants from all over the world, including Argentina, Mongolia and Morocco. The oldest among them will turn 88 shortly.

""Winter swimming has crossed the borders of cold climate countries and has become a global sport,"" Urška Klinar from Si Sport, the company organising the event, said.

Ten Slovenian swimmers have registered for the tournament, including former Olympian Luka Turk.

The participants will check out the water at test swims on Monday with the events in a total of 17 disciplines to follow between Tuesday and Saturday.

The weather is a key factor in the competition and it is important that the water is not too warm, especially for those going for top results and records.

Klinar is happy that the snow and cold have created a lovely backdrop. When Bled hosted the championships in 2020 the problem was too high temperatures and during earlier World Cup events ice had to be cut out from the frozen lake.

Klinar says the water is supposed to have between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius. At this time the lake water temperature is at the upper limit.

The participants will be able to take part in 12 competitive disciplines in different swimming styles, in the lengths of between 25 and 450 metres.

Everyone brave enough can take a dip or dive in the lake and participate in freestyle swims of between 25 and 50 metres without timing. There will be group swims and international relays.

The toughest participants will take part in the Bled Swim, a 1,000-metre distance swim, which will open the competition on Tuesday.

Under the rules, swimmers can only wear goggles, bathing costume and a swim cap made of latex or silicone. Neoprene is not allowed. After the swim, they will be able to warm up in a sauna or jacuzzi and with a cup of hot tea.

Back in 2020, the championships attracted more than 1,100 participants to Bled. This time the Alpine resort is hosting the tournament in place of Russia's Petrozavodsk.",sport,sport
"Pahor says border arbitration never ""poisoned"" Slovenian-Croatian relations","After Golob said last Friday that the border arbitration award, ""which has had such a poisonous effect on relations between the two countries"", was being taken off the political agenda and being given some time, Pahor begged to differ.

Pahor, who had signed the agreement on arbitration as prime minister in 2009, wrote that the agreement not only enabled the border issue to be resolved peacefully and Croatia to join the EU, but also opened a new, friendly chapter in the relations between the two neighbours after 18 years of major and minor security incidents.

While Golob also emphasised that Slovenia remained committed to the outcome of the decision of the tribunal which needed to be implemented, Pahor stressed that the arbitration award set the border between the two countries and was binding for both sides.

""The fact that the border has not yet been demarcated due to Croatia's objections does not change this. When Croatia unilaterally withdrew from respecting the arbitration agreement, Slovenia did not escalate relations. I consider this to have been one of Slovenia's most mature foreign policy decision to date"", he added.

In Pahor's view, arbitration has never ""poisoned"" relations between two countries and their people. If it had, Slovenia would certainly not have given the green light for Croatia to join Schengen, he added.

According to the former president, there is no need to talk much about the fate of the arbitration during officials visits by Slovenian top officials. ""Saying that arbitration is being taken off the agenda could be misinterpreted. Slovenia must insist, in particular during official visits, on the position that the border issue is resolved. Because it is,"" Pahor wrote.",politics,politics
Constitutional complaint filed over Austria extending border checks,"The complaint filed by the law firm Grilc Vouk Škof from Klagenfurt comes after Austria last week announced the intention to extend control on the borders with Slovenia and Hungary, providing migration and security situation in the EU as the reason.

The law firm refers, among others, to the ruling from last April, which established that a member state may reintroduce control at its borders with other member states in the event of a serious threat to its public order or internal security.

However, this control may not exceed a total duration of six months, whereas Austria introduced checks on its borders with Slovenia and Hungary in 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, and has kept extending them by six months ever since.

In the period between May 2016 and November 2017, Austria relied on four consecutive relevant recommendations of the Council of the EU.

After that, the country reintroduced border control on its own initiative from 11 November 2017 for a number of consecutive six-month periods.

According to the EU Court, Austria has not proved the existence of a new serious threat as of 10 November 2017, which is the expiration date of the last recommendation from the Council.

The law firm notes in the complaint that the court has found that control on the Austrian-Slovenian border has no longer been permitted without additional justification as of 2017 and that Austria has since then failed to sufficiently justify it.

The constitutional complaint comes after Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon urged her Austrian counterpart Alexander Schallenberg to ""consider the next steps"" related to extending the border checks.

The Foreign Ministry last week said the decision was unacceptable and regretted the actions of the Austrian authorities, adding it would respond accordingly after the European Commission was notified of the matter.

Fajon told Schallenberg in a telephone conversation that Slovenia did not want stricter border control, especially in the light of the coming tourist season.

The law firm also cited in the complaint the statement by Carinthia Governor Peter Kaiser, who said there had been no reason to control the border between Slovenia and Austria any longer.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Communicable diseases detected in flood-hit areas (adds),"""We have been detecting cases since Tuesday evening and we can expect the number of cases to spread in the coming days,"" the regional unit of the NIJZ has told the STA.

The cases have been detected in the municipalities along the Meža River, with somewhat more cases in and around Črna na Koroškem, the town at the epicentre of flooding. The clusters are isolated for the time being.

An epidemiologist from the NIJZ local unit is there to monitor the situation and cooperate with the authorities and the people. More than ten people have been reported to have sought help so far, with the symptoms of diarrhoea, stomachache and fever.

It is estimated that the number of infected people is higher, as not all of them are likely to have asked for help.

Parts of the northern Koroška region are still without water supply, and even in areas that do have it people need to boil water to make it safe, which entails risks to public health.

It is not clear yet what caused the diseases, but potential risks include contaminated tap water, contaminated food, contact with contaminated debris, poor sanitary conditions and such.

The NIJZ urged following preventive measures in the given situation, advising the locals to use bottled or boiled water for consumption, brushing their teeth, and washing fruits and vegetables.

They are also advised to shower from the neck down to prevent water coming into contact with their face and mouth. They should also wash and sanitise their hands when preparing food.

The debris deposited by water should be handled with gloves.

Protective gloves are also an obligatory part of the equipment for those helping with the clean-up efforts.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
NIJZ celebrates 100th anniversary,"""NIJZ has been carrying out a number of preventive programmes that contribute to better health and prosperity of people in Slovenia. We must not forget that healthy people can contribute a lot to economic and social growth,"" said the president.

Tadej Ostrc, the Health Ministry state secretary, said NIJZ provided expert support when drafting of strategies and policies, among other things.

According to estimates of some international institutions, Slovenia is one of the best countries in Europe in terms of preventive and screening programmes, also thanks to NIJZ, Ostrc said.

NIJZ general director Branko Gabrovec pointed to the coronavirus pandemic, saying that disease prevention and control are one of the key achievements of the 21st century.

The ceremony heard about a number of achievements, among them the preservation of mandatory vaccination of children and youths and preventive programmes that contribute to longer life expectancy. The institute is also active in discouraging the use of tobacco products, and in mental health.

The ceremony was also attended by Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, Digital Transformation Minister Emilija Stojmenova Duh, Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Andrea Ammon, Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction Alexis Goosdeel and WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Henri P. Kluge.

Kluge told the STA that Slovenia was very successful in public health. During the pandemic it was one of only few countries that did not suspend cancer screening tests, he said.

He also praised cooperation with the civil society in the field of public health and good connectivity between primary healthcare with public health and mental health services.

Slovenia's challenges in the future are similar to those in other countries: above all reduction of mortality of preventable causes such as the use of alcohol and tobacco, obesity and sedentary lifestyle.

Kluge also raised the issue of burnout among medical staff during the pandemic. This is linked to staffing problems in the field, he said. He believes solutions could be found in transferring some competences from doctors to nurses and midwives, while states must ensure good working conditions and pay.",health,health
"Democrats want preservation of border fence, army on the border","""The numbers are cause for concern and demand rapid action,"" Anja Bah Žibert, an MP for the Democrats (SDS), said on Tuesday as she presented a motion for an emergency session of the parliamentary Home Policy Committee.

""They are the result of the government's inadmissible policy of open doors for migrants,"" said Bah Žibert.

The motion comes after Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar and Police Commissioner Senad Jušić visited Rigonce, a border village in Brežice municipality where locals have complained about a high number of migrants.

"News roundup - Thursday, 31 August, until 3pm","<b>PM says up to EUR 7bn to be invested in post-flood reconstruction</b>

LJUBLJANA - Prime Minister Robert Golob told the National Assembly that the direct damage caused by the early August floods was currently estimated at EUR 4.7 billion, noting that up to EUR 7 billion would be allocated for the reconstruction of the affected areas in the next five years. Presenting a supplementary budget for 2023 in parliament, Golob said that the government would draft in the coming weeks a reconstruction bill under which between 6.7 and 7 billion euros would be allocated for this effort in the coming years.

<b>Slovenia's GDP growth estimate for 2022 downgraded to 2.5% in real terms</b>

LJUBLJANA - Slovenia's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.5% in real terms last year on an annual basis, shows the first annual estimate by the Statistics Office, which compares to the previous estimate of 5.4% that was based on the aggregation of quarterly data. Last year's growth of GDP was thus significantly slower than the original estimates, and also in comparison to the post-coronavirus epidemic growth in 2021 of 8.2%, mainly due to price volatility and inflation.

<b>Slovenia's annual inflation slightly up to 6.2% in August from July</b>

LJUBLJANA - Slovenia's annual inflation reached 6.2% in August, a rise of 0.1 of a percentage point from July and a drop of 4.8 points from August last year, the Statistics Office said. Annual inflation continued being fuelled by higher prices of food and beverages, which rose by 10.4% in a year, contributing 1.8 points to inflation. At annual level, the prices of most goods and services increased, while some prices decreased significantly, including electricity, which fell by 13.1%, cushioning inflation by 0.7 points.

<b>Triglav group bounces back to post EUR 9.9m net profit in H1</b>

LJUBLJANA - The insurance group Triglav recorded a net profit of EUR 9.9 million in the first half of the year, bouncing back from a EUR 3.7 million loss in the same period last year. This comes as gross premium increased by 12% year-on-year to EUR 893.5 million, shows the financial report. The group around the Ljubljana-based insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav generated EUR 737.9 million in revenue in the first half of the year, up 12% year-on-year.

<b>Cinkarna's net profit down 77% to EUR 7m in H1 as revenue drops 28%</b>

CELJE - The chemical company Cinkarna Celje saw its sales revenue drop by 28% to EUR 96.4 million in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year, while net profit decreased by 77% to EUR 7 million, shows the unaudited half-year report. The Celje-based company says in the report that the 28% drop in sales revenue is due to lower sales and lower average prices for titanium dioxide pigment, which is Cinkarna Celje's main product.

<b>Unior group's net profit down 17% in first six months</b>

ZREČE - Unior, a state-owned tool maker and automotive supplier, generated EUR 6.7 million in net profit at group level in the first six months of the year, a drop of 17% over the same period last year, on nearly EUR 153 million in revenue, which is a 7.8% increase. The parent company's revenue reached just over EUR 108 million and net profit EUR 1.7 million, or a third of last year's, the company said in a press release.

Večer doubts claims that 2008 crisis cannot happen again,"Banks have a lot more capital now than they had 15 years ago and are much more regulated, the banking sector claims.

But several banks have already defaulted this year, the paper notes, pointing to three smaller banks in the US and the much larger Credit Suisse in Europe.

""The banking sector has been able to overcome these defaults for now, but this is not guarantee that it will remain as strong even in the case of a strong recession, with entire economies facing problems.""

Analysts mostly insist that the mild recession in the eurozone and in Germany is only temporary and will not grow stronger or lead to bankruptcies and layoffs, the paper says under the headline Feast is Over.

Slovenian Insurance Association supports efforts for better healthcare,"In addition to managing public funds, Slovenia's challenge is also its demographics, they wrote in Thursday's press release. ""The population is ageing, which requires certain measures and adjustments of systems, especially the healthcare system. We must not neglect the needs of long-term care and the pension budget,"" they said.

""We agree with the finding that the health reform must be comprehensive and must begin where there are the most problems. Then, at the right time it has to consider financing that will ensure an effective access to healthcare services to everyone,"" they wrote, adding that insurance companies had been warning about the issue for years.

Slovenian Insurance Association believes that the list of publicly funded services should be clearly defined with the goal to limit out-of-pocket medical expenses that burden patients.

They are aware that this is a complex challenge that requires solutions that will stabilise the system in the long run. They expect that the government will involve all stakeholders in the process.

The coalition held a discussion on Wednesday on a health reform. One of the planned changes to the health insurance system is the abolition of top-up insurance, which is currently provided by private insurers, who are often accused by the left of skimming off profits.

The government however indicated yesterday that abolition of top-up insurance will not be the first priority.",health,health
Šinko discusses challenges of bioeconomy in Stockholm,"As for meeting long-term goals in sectors based on land use, Šinko said the food and forestry sectors as well as the entire economy are faced with big challenges as they introduce circular economy.

""The bioeconomy goes well beyond the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and its implementation will require synergies across society,"" she said, pointing out that member states have different starting positions.

The scope of agricultural land and its production capacity are limited, while society must preserve this capacity, said Šinko, stressing that countries with little agricultural land per capita are very well aware of this.

She believes ""we need to achieve better integration and effectiveness of the different EU policies while making citizens aware of the benefits of the bioeconomy"", which requires complex changes and time to get implemented.

Ministers also discussed ways to realise the potential of the agriculture and forestry sector in the green transition. Šinko stressed there is no magic tool to strike a balance between climate neutrality, biodiversity, rural development, the nutritional value of food and feed, and energy use in production and transport.

She believes that EU-level strategies such as the Green Deal, the Fork to Fork Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Forestry Strategy are important in terms of setting the framework and overall goals.

However, the CAP is and will remain crucial for agriculture and rural development, where member states must be given the flexibility to choose how they act, what they want to achieve and the steps they need to take in order to achieve them, said the minister, stressing there are far too many administrative hurdles in the current system.

In a meeting with her French counterpart Marc Fesneau, Šinko discussed honey labelling, new genetic technologies, and the situation on the market. Fesneau accepted her invitation to a conference on food chains in Slovenia in October, the Agriculture Ministry said in a press release.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Delo calls for moderation in tourism,"Tourists are scaredy-cats when it comes to weather, Delo writes, adding that a week of rain scared off tens of thousands of tourists from the Istria region.

In the future climate change will have an even larger impact on tourism. Tourists will start to pay closer attention to weather, go on vacation when the forecast is good, and run home when it turns bad. These shorter vacation windows will put a strain on Slovenia's road and other infrastructure.

When the first motorway was built in Slovenia in 1972, it was a true luxury in terms of safety, environment and economy.

Today there are at least eight times more vehicles on the road than in 1972 and freight transport from the port Koper is up 12-fold. Slovenia is no longer a transport-privileged country at the crossroads of Central Europe.

Construction of infrastructure not keeping up is a similar disaster for the country as the August floods, Delo writes. It is lacking in tourism as well, unable to meet the demand of the ever-more discerning and spoiled tourists.

Another problem of tourism in Slovenia are the staff shortages, as Slovenia needs some 5,000 workers and is now importing workforce from Egypt, India and the Philippines.

Still, tourism is proving to be resilient. In the first seven months of the year tourists spent 5% more nights in Slovenia than in the same period in the record year of 2019.

Delo believes that in many places there were too many tourists for the lacking infrastructure and staff shortages.

Some 40 years ago German tourism experts were talking about the ""mit einsicht"" model of tourism (""with feeling""). Phrases like this are often not taken seriously but this is the only option that Slovenia has, the paper writes.

There is more and more talk about climate change, sustainability and the carbon footprint but ""we demand at least a 5% increase in tourism numbers every year.""

When the number of tourists in Portorož drops by 1%, fast food and ice cream joints talk of a catastrophic season. ""Let's figure out where the limits to our greed are,"" Delo writes.

Strategies should have been put in place ages ago, along with investments to modernise tourism infrastructure. Not to increase the numbers of tourists but to host them properly in the environment that we too are only visiting occasionally, somewhat like hosts and tourists with feeling, Delo concludes.",weather,lifestyle and leisure
"Farmers give up on talks with govt, announce new rally (adds)","Addressing the press after two weeks of talks as part of a task force set up as thousands of farmers took to the streets with their tractors in more than two dozen towns on 24 March, the farmer representatives said the negotiations with the government were not meeting their expectations.

The main demands of the farmers include the adjusting of new environmental rules so as to stay within realistic limits still allowing farming, a re-examination and reduction of Natura 2000-protected areas, the refraining from new taxes, clear and simple rules and the adjustment of direct payments and other funds they receive to cope with inflation.

They also want to see a reduction in the population of carnivores and the immediate start of effective population management. They are also calling for legislation to protect prime agricultural land and preserve it for food production, for livestock farming to be considered as the basis for sustainable farming, and for a full scrapping of the regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products at national level.

Anton Medved, president of the Trade Union of Slovenian Farmers, said that the material presented by the government in talks was flawed, misleading, and lacked legal and professional basis. ""We will no longer attend the meetings of the task force,"" Medved announced, although the farmer organisations had said they would give the taskforce a three-week grace period.

He added that the ""straw that broke the camel's back and was also very humiliating to farmers were the proposed amendments to the Animal Protection Act"".

""We farmers are the ones who are most aware of the importance of animal protection and we strongly condemn any kind of animal torture. However, it is totally unacceptable that the proposal envisages turning livestock farms into a training ground for so-called activists who are supposed to judge the soundness of animal care by breeders on the basis of a 40-hour course,"" said Medved.

Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (KGZS) president Roman Žveglič said the proposal mocked the profession and breeders. Undoubtedly, inappropriate treatment of animals must be prevented and punished, but such a procedure requires a comprehensive professional approach, he said about the plan to introduce authorised animal protection advisers.

The chamber noted on Monday that official veterinarians undergo several years of training to perform these tasks, including six years of studying. ""Considering that advisers will be trained quickly and the activist attitude of some animal protection associations, there is justified concern that the powers will often be exceeded and that the privacy of animal attendants will be encroached on,"" the KZGS said.

Medved meanwhile added today that Slovenia farmers had never been as united as today. ""We are not demanding money or the replacement of the minister, but only the protection of the Slovenian farmer and consumer,"" he said, announcing a protest rally in Ljubljana for next Tuesday and a stepping up of industrial action if necessary.

Prime Minister Robert Golob said that farmers' representatives leaving the negotiations with the government so quickly suggested that there might be some other interest behind it.

Golob regretted their decision to suspend the negotiations and resume protests as early as next week, saying that the government had entered the talks in a sincere manner, believing that the other side was sincere, too.

""Such a quick departure makes one think that perhaps something else is behind it - politics, and not the actual interest of farmers. But time will tell what is really behind it,"" the prime minister told the press.

As for the farmers' opposition to the changes to the Animal Protection Act, Golob noted that the neighbouring countries had significantly stricter animal protection measures than Slovenia.

""I think it is time for Slovenia to join civilised Europe or at least its neighbours in this field,"" he said.

The prime minister also commented on the latest culling quota of 230 brown bears, which is the highest culling figure to date, saying that the issue should be revisited. He called on Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Minister Uroš Brežan, who cleared the measure last week, to suspend it and thus allow the government to reconsider the issue.

Bear culling has been again in the spotlight recently due to the agricultural damage these animals cause.",environmental issue,environmental issue

Discus thrower Čeh wins silver in at world championships,"It was an exciting final series, which was decided with the very last throw after Čeh took the lead with what was by then the only throw over 70 metres.

Stahl, the Olympic champion, was a bit reserved in the first three rounds, and then achieved a 69.37m throw in the fourth round. The 30-year-old saved the best for last, flinging his discus to a 71.46m mark, almost a metre and a half ahead of the Slovenian.

Čeh, who had a sizeable fan base from around his home town of Ptuj in the stands of the National Athletics Centre in the Hungarian capital, finished ahead of Mykolas Alekna of Lithuania (68.85m), who had to settle for the bronze medal.

The Slovenian thus failed to defend his gold medal from last year's World Athletics Championship in Eugene, US, while winning the seventh medal for Slovenia at the world stage. Čeh also has the silver medal from the 2022 European Championships in Munich.",sport,sport
Slovenia's economy generated EUR 750m surplus last year,"In the first quarter of last year, the deficit in transactions with foreign countries amounted to EUR 217 million, or 1.6% of GDP, and in the entire 2022 the deficit amounted to EUR 606 million, or 1% of GDP.

The return to a surplus this year is a consequence of the better terms of trade for the Slovenian economy, with the prices of imported energy and raw materials dropping and the exports improving, the Statistics Office said on Friday.

In the trade in goods and services, Slovenia recorded a surplus in the first three months of the year of more than one billion euros, or 6.7% of GDP.

Compared to the same period last year, the surplus increased by EUR 968 million, as the growth in exports of goods and services (10.3%) was significantly higher than the growth in imports (2.3%).

The amount of the primary income, current transfers and capital transfers abroad was EUR 226 million or 1.5% of GDP higher than the same amount received from abroad.

Non-financial enterprises also generated a surplus in the first quarter of the year, which reached EUR 686 million or 4.6% of GDP, which is higher than in the same period last year (EUR 509 million or 3.8% of GDP).

Meanwhile, the surplus of financial and insurance companies decreased by EUR 53 million compared to the same period last year to EUR 67 million, or 0.4% of GDP.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

Leaders discuss crisis management at international conference,"Addressing nearly 400 participants from 27 countries, IEDC head Danica Purg said it was the job of schools and leaders to set the right course to address the many different and complex crises faced by organisations and society in general.

Former Finnish prime minister and manager at Nokia Esko Aho shared his experience, saying crises should not be feared but seen as opportunities for fast and great changes.

It is key that those in charge are aware that crises demand changes in existing strategies and concepts, which in turn are key to transformation of a business or a country, said Aho.

He added that short-term performance should not be in focus during a crisis, instead one must concentrate on long-term success. Moreover, one must not expect public support, he said, adding that changes require risk-taking and patience.

Aho underlined the importance of innovation. Europe has made mistakes in the past which made it incapable of competing with the US and China. But it does have great potential in the implementation of new technologies due to its highly educated population.

Mate Rimac, the Croatian founder of supercars maker Rimac Automobili, talked about his 15 years as entrepreneur, saying the first decade was a constant struggle for survival. He was young and had nothing to lose, which made things easier.

""We were driven and we wanted to prove that we can succeed even though we were inexperienced,"" Rimac said. He kept his company in Croatia despite not having access to capital, state support, suppliers or the market.

Therefore the company was forced to think globally, which Rimac sees as an advantage of a small economy. He believes it is important for countries to invest more in education and attract talent and work force from abroad.

Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob also attended the conference, saying he learnt only recently that it was not wise to announce changes in advance. ""This creates excessive expectations in the public,"" said Golob.

One must make small steps and continue proving oneself, he said, adding it was very important to stay focused, which is much harder to do in politics than in business.

Golob believes it is a great advantage that he is a positive person and expects his positivity to spill over into the majority of the population.

Talking about the crisis faced by the world today, Golob said that alongside the crisis in Ukraine and the migration crisis, countries must still remain focused in the climate crisis.

""At the moment each country is trying to do something for themselves. But true crises cannot be overcome that way,"" said the prime minister.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Slovenian researchers help treat heart disease with electroporation,"Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm that is becoming a wide-spread health condition and requires early detection and effective treatment. The most recognized method for now is catheter ablation, which involves isolating pulmonary veins from the left atrium, usually with radiofrequency energy or cryoablation.

Having undergone a successful clinical trial, the new catheter ablation method uses electroporation, which is exposing a cell to short electric shocks and temporarily increases the permeability of the cell membrane.

In this case the electroporation is irreversible, meaning that the surgeon removes a part of the tissue causing arrhythmia. Unlike other methods, the tissue is not heated or frozen, making it much safer.

Electroporation is used in treating tumours, gene therapy, biotechnology and environmental technologies. It is also part of food pasteurization and waste water treatment.

The faculty's research team, lead by Damijan Miklavčič, has been working on the project with the Medtronic company from the US, one of the leading medical equipment suppliers in the world, since 2015. The University of Ljubljana and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering are one of the leading experts in the field.

The study was carried out at 41 locations in 9 countries and included 383 patients. Catheter ablation with electroporation was performed by 67 cardiologists specializing in electrophysiology. The goal was to determine the procedure's safety and its effectiveness within a year after therapy.

The operation is fairly simple, the faculty noted, as the majority of cardiologists who have successfully performed it had no prior experience using the catheter.

Results of the study were published in Circulation, a reputable scientific journal on cardio-vascular health. Atul Verma, head of the clinical trial from the McGill University in Canada, presented the findings on Monday at a medical congress in New Orleans.",health,science and technology
Ski jumper Jelar wins first podium this season,"Taking place only four days before the start of the FIS Nordic World Championships in Planica, the turnout for the event was so low there was no need to hold the qualifications.

Germany was the only country to take its A-list team to compete in Rasnov, with Wellinger being the only top-10 ski jumper in the overall world cup rankings.

This was Jelar's first podium this season and his fourth overall in the world cup.

Slovenia's team in Rasnov also included Maksim Bartolj, who finished in 20th place, Rok Masle, who finished 25th, Matija Vidic, who placed 34th, and Žak Mogel, who finished 38th. Jelar is the only of the five who has made the roster for Planica.",sport,sport
Cyclists to auction off jerseys to help flood-stricken communities,"The other four riders joining the Cyclists for Slovenia campaign, initiated by Roglič's foundation, are Luka Mezgec, Jan Tratnik, Domen Novak and Matevž Govekar.

""It's time for all of us to stand together to help the victims of the catastrophic floods that have devastated our country. Seven cyclists from the ICU World Tour, seven signed jerseys, one auction. Let's show that we are strong and that we care for each other.

""All for one and one for all. With a heart for Slovenia,"" they said in a video they shared on social media. The funds raised will be transferred to persons or organizations chosen by the cyclists. The top bid currently stands at EUR 8,500.

Mohorič and Pogačar have both already chipped in to support the flood relief efforts. The former donated the prize money he received for his win at the Tour de Pologne, totalling EUR 24,495, and the latter will contribute EUR 10 for every selfie he takes with fans in Congress Square in Ljubljana next week, adding to his initial donation of EUR 10,000.",sport,sport
Delo says US has become revolutionary state,"In yet another version of American reversed reality, the American working class defends the so-called American dream. Trump, a millionaire accused of a number of offences, including that he paid his alleged lover for silence during his election campaign, is paradoxically the only hope of a great part of the American working class for the return of the country's greatness, Delo says in its front-page commentary All American Revolutions.

""Many legal experts claim the allegations are shaky, but it is not just about Trump, but also about different visions of the US society: an equally big part of the left-leaning electorate sees the former president as the biggest threat to US dignity.

""The situation is so acute that, even before the indictment of Trump, there were calls for the US to be divided into red and blue parts, the Republican countryside versus the Democratic big cities on the ocean shores. Despite the fact that President Abraham Lincoln, in his day, launched a bloody civil war because of the threat of secession of the slave-holding states.""

Meanwhile, another American revolution is taking place before the eyes of the world, this time for greater justice for the oppressed racial, sexual and other groups in society. As the symbols of American greatness of past decades and even centuries melt away in the reckoning with the supposed dominance of white men, the paper wonders whether the instigators of new social revolutions dare to claim that their USA will be richer and stronger.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Večer wonders whether health reform will withstand pressure,"Healthcare has been the breaking point of not only many ministers but also of many governments. So some say that by supporting the health reform PM Robert Golob is risking his job if not his political career.

However, it is clear that a reform is not possible without the support of both the prime minister and the finance minister.

Interestingly, the most challenging decisions are being postponed to 2024 and 2025, a period just before the next election, the paper says.

Is this calculation the reason why the coalition Left has agreed to have the supplementary abolished this late? Is this the tactics for a new political victory or is it inevitable to take it one step at a time if the system is to be protected against a collapse?

The 120-page document Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan presented sounds encouraging. Even though it mainly reviews the current situation and offers but a few concrete ideas.

But the main question is whether the government will withstand the much talked about pressure within healthcare. It is not irrelevant that the healthcare budget has never been bigger.

Even if the corruptive leeches that thrive in the murky waters, which the minister says will be gone once the system is well regulated, are put aside, the path to reform will entail a fight between the local and national authorities - municipalities and the government, Večer says under the headline Grounds for Reform.",politics,politics
"PM says govt would not give up in ""liberating"" RTV Slovenija","The answer came after Hoivik accused Golob of wanting to take over the public broadcaster but failing to do it as fast as he wanted to.

He also accused the prime minister of exerting pressure on the Constitutional Court, which is deliberating on the government's bill that would bring significant changes to RTV Slovenija management.

Because this has not borne fruit, Golob set out to ""liberate RTV Slovenija of programme councillors he cannot stand,"" Hoivik said.

""This would have been funny if it weren't tragic,"" Golob responded. He said that liberating the public broadcaster from the claws of politics was his main promise before last year's election.

""Just like I don't want RTV Slovenija to be the mouthpiece of a right-leaning party, I also don't want it to be a mouthpiece for the Freedom Movement,"" Golob said.

He noted that the amendments to the RTV Slovenija legislation had received 63% support at the referendum last year. This decision has not yet been implemented due to the failures of the rule of law, said Golob.

He called on the Constitutional Court to make a decision fast. ""I'm not calling for a specific decision, just that it should be made.""",politics,politics
Govt to abolish flood solidarity contribution (adds),"The government discussed today changes to the act on flood emergency measures and the act on reconstruction and development. The former is being amended to speed up residential reconstruction prepayments.

These are planned for owners who will not have to rebuild their homes. The prepayment will cover 20% of the damage estimate reported via the special-purpose Ajda application.

This will apply to buildings for which damage estimate exceeds EUR 6000 and where at least one person was in official residence at the end of July, said minister.

Meanwhile, people who will have to rebuild their homes or build new ones in other locations will be eligible to funds through a different procedure, Infrastructure Minister Alenka Bratušek said at the press conference.

In such cases, prepayments will be paid out automatically by the Financial Administration after a home will be declared unsafe for residence by experts, Bratušek said. She believes the prepayment scheme will not exceed EUR 50 million.

The changes also abolish the mandatory solidarity contribution, said Boštjančič, adding this would be partially covered by a temporary increase in corporate income tax, which is to be included in the act on reconstruction and development. The government intends to raise the corporate income tax from 19% to 22% for a period of five years.

However, voluntary working Saturdays remain in place. Workers' pay will go into the budget for flood repair, while employers will not have to pay social contributions and tax for that day.

The changes to the act on flood emergency measures also regulate the obligation of the state to fund the management of polluted soil created by the floods and landslides by 1 July 2024 at the latest.

The government also changed provisions on the compensation of cost for those who had to relocate. The compensation will depend on the number of members in a household and will range from EUR 150 to EUR 250 a month.

The changes also entail simplification of administrative procedures and a loan guarantee scheme, as well as a variety of measures for businesses and municipalities, among other things, according to the finance minister.

The changes will be sent to parliament on Friday, while the act on reconstruction and development will be sent to social partners and parliamentary parties on the same day as well.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
Slovenian artist warns of climate change with Vienna Ringturm project,"The picture on the monumental cloth depicts icebergs carved into the summertime setting and a group of bathers who have gathered below to enjoy the magic of the coastal scenery, said Wiener Städtische, the insurance company headquartered in the landmark building.

The 4,000 square metre artistic covering is made of a total of 30 printed netting sheets, each around 3 metres wide and up to 63 metres long. The installation will be up all summer.

""I want my picture to highlight nature's inherent potential for change. Like the people in my picture, all of us are only tiny fragments of a larger context. Wandering Icebergs have become a symbol of climate change.

""To me, they also represent just how unpredictable events can be - at this particular moment on the beach, it's not entirely clear how the day will turn out for the bathers,"" the 49-year-old, who works and lives in Berlin, said of her work.

Born in Nova Gorica, western Slovenia, Bućan is a freelance photographer and a mentor at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Ljubljana. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague in 2010 and has since been focusing on depicting the relationship between people and nature in her work, as well as the status of women in society.

Her work has been displayed in Slovenia and abroad, including at the Kunsthaus in Vienna, the Lentos Kunstmuseum in Linz, the Benaki Museum in Greece, the Lishui and Cafa art museums in China, and the Banjaluka Museum of Contemporary Art in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Many renowned Austrian artists have given the Ringturm a makeover over the years, including Gottfried Helnweina and Arnulfa Rainer.

Voice of the People unhappy with coalition party leaders (adds),"The group held a similar pre-election discussion in April 2022, where all three presidents of what are now the coalition parties were in attendance, so it expected them to attend today's post-election discussion as well.

Voice of the People wanted the coalition leaders to express their commitments directly to the people in a live, open and public space, so that people can ask them questions directly.

To show its disappointment, Voice of the People has written an open letter to Freedom Movement leader and Prime Minister Robert Golob, Social Democrats (SD) head Tanja Fajon and leader of the Left Luka Mesec.

The letter states that the three officials changed their minds about attending the meeting ""at the last minute"" and decided that the deputy group leaders would attend instead.

The letter reads that a meeting with the deputy group leaders is welcome, ""but it cannot be a substitute for a meeting"" with Golob, Fajon and Mesec, who made certain commitments to voters in their pre-election debates.

Voice of the People also pointed out that this post-election discussion would be important in creating a continuous dialogue between the people and their government, which is an essential part of the democratic process.

While the group is now inviting the coalition leaders to a new discussion on 20 September, the coalition parties rejected the accusations, saying they remained committed to dialogue with civil society.

The Freedom Movement said that the key to successful cooperation was mutual respect, understanding and constructive attitude, as the two junior coalition parties underlined that they strived to seek solutions acceptable for everybody and benefiting as many as possible.

The ruling party told the STA that it had received the invitation at the beginning of the month without any prior coordination regarding the date, which would be welcome given that the prime minister had his schedule booked for months in advance. The same expectation of coordination applies to heads of the other two coalition parties, the Freedom Movement added.

The SocDems wrote that the proposed date coincided with a planned visit by Fajon, who is foreign minister, to South Korea. Moreover, the Left stressed it regularly participated in various discussions organised by civil society.",politics,politics

Anti-graft watchdog probes ex-minister Vizjak over public funding,"The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (KPK) said on Friday that the case related to the placement of a state-funded measure in the Climate Change Fund's spending programme for 2022-23.

In 2021 the KPK completed a procedure related to suspected conflict of interest regarding the former minister in the Janez Janša government (2020-2022) in which no violations of the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act had been found.

However, a preliminary investigation was subsequently initiated because the watchdog received additional information in a November 2021 report which alleged various irregularities in the allocation of funds for the Mokrice hydro power plant from the Climate Change Fund.

The anti-graft watchdog also obtained extensive documentation from the relevant ministries and explanations from the officials who participated in decision-making at the Climate Change Fund.

It said that an investigation had been initiated against Vizjak in October due to the perceived suspicion of breach of integrity in the placement of the state-funded measure, called Promotion, in the fund's spending programme for 2022-23.

The KPK also looked at Vizjak's alleged influence regarding an increase in funding for the Mokrice project, and the suspicion of corruption in the issuance of the consent of the Fisheries Research Institute for the construction of the hydro power plant.

Based on the available evidence, the commission could not confirm violations of the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act, so the procedure has been stopped.

However, the findings will be handed over to the police due to perceived suspicion that a criminal act has been committed.

Uroš Brežan, who was until recently the natural resources and spatial planning minister, last October ordered an internal audit of the operation of the fund, with the final results proving to be incriminating for his predecessor Vizjak.

The newspaper Dnevnik obtained the unofficial results of the audit to report that Vizjak's team at the ministry had channelled money from the Climate Change Fund to HESS, where Vizjak worked before taking over at the ministry in 2020.

One of the examples of the channelling of funds is said to be the Promotion measure, under which HESS, which manages and builds hydro power plants on the lower course of the Sava River, was allocated EUR 1.5 million.

According to Dnevnik, the auditors found out that the measure had not been devised by the ministry, but rather by HESS.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"

The changes increase the share of mandatory state coverage from 48% to 60% of average pay, but at the same time they abolish a decree adopted by the previous government, under which the state covers social contributions for religious workers in their entirety, in effect lowering the share from 100% to 60%.

Soldiers no longer participate in control of southern border,"The government announced this as it answered a question from opposition Democrats (SDS) MP Branko Grims, who inquired about the withdrawal of soldiers from the border despite what he labelled as ""drastically increased inflow of illegal migrants.""

Grims also spoke about of ""abuses of the asylum procedure"", saying that ""illegal migration will be a major problem in the long run"", so the government should maintain or, if necessary, even strengthen the measures to protect the border.

The government replied that the decision to suspend the deployment of soldiers to help the police in protecting the border was taken on 13 December at a meeting between the SAF command and police, as the latter is undergoing reorganisation due to Croatia's entry into the Schengen Area.

It added that the army still cooperated with the police in securing the border with Croatia by removing the border fence and providing logistical support in road maintenance and in various forms of training in the area.

Asked about the protection of the border in the future, the government said that as of 2023, the police ""no longer carries out systematic protection of the state border, while implementing compensatory measures in line with risk assessments"".

The police will carry out joint border patrols with the Croatian counterparts more often in order to detect cross-border crime and illegal migration, and auxiliary police may also be engaged if need be, the government added.

As for the alleged abuses related to international protection applications, the government rejected the claims that the number of applications in 2022 exceeded the total number of applications for asylum in five years prior to that.

A total of 6,664 applications for international protection had been submitted last year by 22 December, while in the five years prior to that (2017-2021) there were a total of 17,021 applications, it noted.

The costs related to applicants for international protection in the first eleven months of last year amounted to EUR 4.37 million. These include cleaning, security, food, medical services, clothing, footwear, sanitation, energy, water and utility services.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Bilingual education in focus as minister visits minority in Hungary,"The minister visited two bilingual primary schools, in Szentgotthárd and Felsőszölnök, where the head teachers presented the conditions, and held talks with minority officials.

The minority reported that they are trying to find ways to secure a sufficient number of bilingual teachers. Arčon expressed his support for their efforts, according to the Government Office for Slovenians Abroad.

Bilingual instruction is available from kindergarten through secondary school, and there are some Slovenian study programmes at universities in Budapest and Szombathely.

Nevertheless, bilinguality at these institutions is still behind the level provided in bilingual schools in Slovenia, in areas where the Hungarian minority live, the office said.",education,education
Number of people in need of aid from Caritas up 10% in 2022,"The 2022 report on the charity's website shows that more than 143,000 persons benefited from one of its programmes, of whom over 26,700 children and 35,000 elderly people.

Food aid was provided to nearly 70,000 parents with children and individuals and nearly 730 homeless people, while Caritas also helped pay bills to 17,600 elderly people, a 17% rise.

A total of EUR 11.1 million was spent on aid programmes at home and another EUR 4.4 million on aid shipped abroad, of which EUR 3.3 million went to Ukraine, said Tomažič.

Many people would like to work but once they get a job they lose all the benefits and end up financially worse off than if unemployed, he added.

Tomažič would thus like employers to set a decent pay for a well done job as a standard rather than insisting on the minimum wage.

Alenka Petek, a social worker from Caritas Ljubljana, said having a job used to be a way out of poverty, which is no longer the case.

An increasingly large number of families where both parents work turn to them for help as they find it hard to make ends meet due to high commercial rents.

Many of them apply for public rental housing but with the shortage of public homes for rent few are awarded one.

Janez Kastelic from Caritas Domžale said many people in need are afraid to ask for aid due to social stigma.

Immigrants and refugees also have a hard time, especially as they struggle with basic language skills, said Petek.

Many elderly people are also struggling on their low pensions, especially amid high inflation, and they are also socially excluded as their circle of friends is narrowing.

""They worked hard all their lives, but now they are dependent on humanitarian organisations, which often makes them feel very humiliated,"" she added.

Caritas tries to help people who are just below eligibility for other forms of state-provided aid or allowances, Tomažič said. Many of them have decent incomes, but struggle to survive because of debt, illness or other circumstances.

And with the prices of food, housing and other necessities further rising, the situation is not improving, he said.",human interest,human interest
Večer cautions about next financial crisis,"The turmoil on the financial markets following the collapse of smaller US commercial banks and the takeover of Credite Suisse, a superbank, is certainly not over, the paper says, commenting on the recent developments in the financial world.

""Regulators and politicians have learnt nothing from the last banking and financial crisis 15 years ago. In the light of recent events, it is increasingly questionable whether this was ever the intention. In fact, there is nothing left of the great promises of regulation that would no longer tolerate speculation and abuses allowing bankers and other financial speculators to first make fat profit as private individuals and then have their losses covered by the taxpayer.

""There is plenty of money for speculation, because for years central banks have literally flooded the markets with it. The more money is available, the more the appetites of speculators grow, the more their circle widens. The greater the profits for top officials, the greater risks they can afford to take, the more arrogant and greedy they become.""

And to make sure they really have nothing to worry about, top bank officials are also members of regulators' bodies, which means they are actually controlling themselves, the paper says.

While politicians salvage them with billions in taxpayer money, the fines that courts slap top superbank officials with are quite low compared to the profits made and they do not even have to pay for them from their own pocket, Večer says, noting that these costs are covered by the banks.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Public sector trade unions up in arms over alleged wage adjustment ban,"A total of 36 public trade unions signed a statement calling on MPs to amend the government's budget implementation bill, one of whose articles they say precludes basic wage adjustments in 2024. The noted that no automatic adjustment exists in the public sector.

The unions argue that the article ""de facto terminates negotiations"" on wages, which they find completely unacceptable and a violation of the constitutional right to trade union association and activity.

They speak of an attempt to discipline them ""at a time when the government claims that it is in its interest to reach an agreement with the unions on a new public sector pay system"".

While describing the negotiations as being very turbulent in recent months, the unions accused the government of simultaneously acting as the holder of power and as an employer"", of putting forward contentious legislative provisions to secure the goals pursued in the negotiations.

""It is thereby demonstrating that it does not understand the meaning of the equality of partners and the importance of social dialogue,"" the unions wrote, calling on MPs to throw out the article in question.

""This way you will allow the negotiations to continue and ensure that both sides in this social dialogue are on an equal footing. Otherwise, you will also be assuming responsibility for unilateral interference in the ongoing negotiations, and unfortunately force us to to resort to other forms of industrial action.""

Watchdog's report reiterates concerns about integrity breaches,"The commission is successful, but it needs to become more effective, reads its press release.

Amending the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act may contribute to this, but politics ""has not been responding to the Commission's initiatives to regulate the incompatibility of holding multiple public offices in a uniform manner"".

The way of displaying changes or assets remains incomplete. Sanctions for breaches of integrity or non-compliance with the commission's recommendations need to be laid down, and lobbying rules need to be revised.

In 2022, the watchdog recorded a year-on-year increase in the numbers of reports received and resolved, as well as a higher number of investigations, noted Commission president Robert Šumi.

Proven conflicts of interest are most often only a step away from corruption, the Commission said, and holding several posts at the same time is generally not in the public interest.

Moreover, ""standards of integrity, accountability and transparency"", in addition to competence, should be the golden rules in the selection or appointment of senior executives.

The report focuses on integrity, since the watchdog believes that integrity is a prerequisite for trust. What is needed the most in order to fight corruption is cooperation between politics, the public sector, independent public authorities, industry, NGOs and media.

The watchdog also drew attention to one of its projects which raises awareness about the importance of integrity among young people. A total of 17 primary schools and one kindergarten participate in the project.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
New network security requirements and restrictions unveiled,"Unveiling the draft implementing act on Thursday, the Agency for Communications Networks and Services (AKOS) said that the proposal set out guidelines for mobile communications network operators in their dealings with IT and network equipment providers and in risk assessment, and would allow the implementation of the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act.

Since the proposal, which is now in public consultation, also applies to network operators already using certain technology or equipment from certain manufacturers, the provisions provide for a transitional period to comply with the additional security requirements.

Providers of mobile communication services may therefore use the existing equipment or the equipment for which they have already concluded a contract until the end of its lifetime, but no longer than seven years from the publication of the relevant new rules in the Official Gazette.

The proposal was drawn up in cooperation with the government's Information Security Office on the basis of Article 116 of the Electronic Communications Act, which was adopted in September last year and brought about a major overhaul of the regulation of electronic communications.

The article in question determines that an implementing act will lay out critical network elements and associated information systems and other technical guidelines to be complied with by operators providing mobile networks to critical infrastructure.

In the efforts to develop the proposal, AKOS and the Information Security Office have also turned to the EU toolbox for 5G security, which contains a set of comprehensive measures for a coordinated EU-wide approach to securing 5G networks. Moreover, AKOS took into account the latest guidelines of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity.

Responding to criticism in some media about the slow pace of the adoption of the proposal, AKOS said that the draft implementing act dealt with complex and technically demanding issues and required substantial preparations, which is why it had taken longer than originally planned.

The opposition and certain media have been also criticising the new law on electronic communications, as they believe it was water-downed from its original form to appease Huawei.

The coalition-proposed amendments to the bill changed its provisions regarding security requirements that could apply to Huawei. Instead of banning cooperation with certain suppliers designated as ""high-risk suppliers"", the law now prohibits the use of equipment that could jeopardise national security.

While the Democrats (SDS) believe that the ruling coalition caved in to pressure from China and Huawei, the government and the coalition have argued that if the bill had been passed in its initial form, it would have been discriminatory against the supplier on the basis of its origin, regardless of the actual safety of the equipment.

Earlier this week, the news portal Necenzurirano was also critical of the water-downed security provisions of the law, whose passage took as long as two years, as well as of the slow pace of adopting AKOS's implementing act. This suits Huawei, which is reported to be first in the line of potential 5G equipment suppliers of Telekom Slovenije, the portal said.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Dnevnik says new health minister candidate is a safe choice,"If many warnings about Danijel Bešič Loredan's experiences with previous employers were overheard when the former health minister was appointed, this time Golob will obviously strive to avoid creating new hotspots.

Forwarding Prevolnik Rupel as candidate is in line with Golob's belief that the health minister must foremost be a connective force and not so much a visionary.

Stakeholders in healthcare have cooperated with Prevolnik Rupel during the government of Borut Pahor, when she was the right hand of Health Minister Dorjan Marušič. She is known as a fair consensus seeker who avoids direct confrontation.

But already her announcement of changes to the patient's rights basket is a slippery slope. In contrast, the guidelines she presented as state secretary in September outlined a strategy of small steps.

""When ministers take over at the Health Ministry as a second choice the expectations are usually lower and the aspirations for compromises greater.

Experts surprised by simultaneous record heat and rainfall,"""Every year we see new meteorological records and we have come to expect them,"" climatologist Lučka Kajfež Bogataj told the STA on Tuesday.

""What is surprising this year is the simultaneous record high temperatures and record rainfall appearing almost at the same time all around the globe,"" she said. ""Like the warming of the planet, weather events and damage are suddenly global,"" she added.

When asked about the factors that contributed to the extreme weather events, Kajfež Bogataj responded that already in June the temperatures of air, ground and oceans had risen rapidly above their average values. The deviations on a global scale were the highest ever recorded.

The Atlantic Ocean was very warm, while temperatures in parts of the Mediterranean Sea were four degrees above average at the start of the summer.

""That meant a lot of warm water evaporating and sending enormous amounts of water vapour into the atmosphere. Because the air was warm too, it was able to store more vapour,"" said the climatologist, explaining that air that is warmer by one degree can store 7% more water vapour.

If certain conditions are met, such as a cold front passing over diverse terrain or a constant influx of humid air, precipitation processes have a much larger supply of water, Kajfež Bogataj said.

""This summer was globally and in many places in Europe the warmest ever recorded,"" she said. A warmer climate also means that air can rise faster in storm clouds that have the heaviest rainfall, while large differences in temperature can lead to larger hail and an increased possibility of tornados.

Record rainfall 'of the century' is becoming rainfall 'of the decade' and no region in Slovenia is weather neutral or safe, Kajfež Bogataj said. Strong, destructive winds or hail can appear anywhere.

The relation between weather events and the damage they cause is not linear. ""Double the rain can, for example, cause four times the damage,"" she said, adding that even small changes to the climate should be concerning.

While there are debates on solar and nuclear power, electric cars, smart grids ""at least on paper"", Slovenia ""has overlooked that climate change is already here and is here to stay"", she said, adding the state was not able to draft a comprehensive strategy for adapting to climate change.

Kajfež Bogataj noted that the measures taken in the past, including emergency laws, ad hoc damages payouts and buying votes with promises ahead of elections, have been very ineffective, while the cheapest measure of educating the population was forgotten.

People are now informed through social media in ways that ""escalate emotions instead of increasing the understanding of the current situation"", she said.

Environmental economist Jonas Sonnenschein from the NGO Umanotera is also critical of strategies not being carried out and of the lack of legislative framework for adapting to climate change.

There is also a ""structural lack of knowledge and expertise"", he said, adding that ""it is still not clear how the issue can be solved"".

Slovenia failed to use funds from the EU financial framework 2014-2020 for adapting to climate change, Sonnenschein said. As of recently, EUR 170 million of resources for flooding prevention measures are no longer available in the national recovery and resilience plan.

The mode of operation has to change systemically in agriculture, industry, infrastructure, city planning, facilities and human behaviour to adapt to the new and changing climate, he said.

The focus for measures in critical infrastructure should be on protection against floods, droughts and extreme heat, increasing resiliency of forests to extreme weather events, fires and pests, and building climate resilient infrastructure, Sonnenschein told the STA.",weather,disaster and accident
State budget deficit halved to EUR 1.4bn in 2022,"Last year's budget revenue reached 98.4% of the revenue planned in the supplementary budget, while expenditure reached 94% of what was planned in the revised budget.

""The lower-than-planned expenditure, and hence the lower deficit, projected at around EUR 2 billion in the updated budget, is mainly due to lower-than-planned expenditure earmarked for measures related to Covid-19 and the energy crisis, and some lower-than-planned investment expenditure,"" the ministry said.

Tax revenue inflow reached just under EUR 10.4 billion last year, an increase of 12.3% compared to the previous year.

VAT revenue amounted to over EUR 4.7 billion, up 11.7% on 2021. ""This growth is due to the slowdown in economic activity and consumption during the epidemic and the knock-on effect of the release of pent-up consumption last year, as well as inflation,"" the ministry said.

Income tax revenue rose by 4.3% to just under EUR 1.6 billion. The ministry attributes the increase to higher employment rates, promotions and the public sector wage deal, as well as wage growth in the private sector.

Corporate tax revenue in 2022 was up 38.5% on 2021 to just over EUR 1.5 billion, the highest on record.

Excise duty revenue amounted to EUR 1.4 billion, down 1.6% on the year before. An important role was played by lower excise duties on motor fuels, which were reduced to the minimum level allowed under EU rules.

Non-tax revenue amounted to EUR 772 million, 5.5% less than the year before, while Slovenia received EUR 957 million from the EU, EUR 10 million more than in 2021.

Last year, slightly under EUR 2 billion, 22.4% less than the year before, was spent on transfers to individuals and households.

Almost EUR 1.7 billion was spent on investment, up 34.8% on the previous year and the most in history.

Last year, the state paid EUR 655 million in interest, EUR 72 million less than the year before, as a result of record-low interest rates on the capital markets.

Subsidies amounted to around EUR 642 million, down 21.2% on 2021, mainly due to lower expenditure on measures related to Covid-19.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

Slovenia complies with Court of Justice ruling as last dangerous dump site closes,"The EU Court of Justice found in 2018 that Slovenia failed to take appropriate measures in the case of 20 dump sites by June 2009 and one more site by July 2016 after environmental licences for the sites had not been renewed. It ordered Slovenia to close the dump sites as soon as possible.

According to the ministry, dumping waste at the sites stopped even before the court ruling.

By the end of 2020 the Environment Ministry closed 20 of the sites. The closing process was not completed only for the Suhadole site, where, according to the ministry, the issue was that the land was owned by multiple private owners.

Večer says second unit at N-plant not among govt priorities,"It seems that the strategy of energy company GEN-I, the main promoter of solar power plants in the country that used to be run by Prime Minister Robert Golob, is now becoming the national strategy.

""Is that a good thing? It could be if citizens were given a comprehensive presentation on what this strategy is really like.""

The fact that Dejan Paravan, Golob's former close associate from GEN-I, is now GEN Energija's CEO, makes the situation even more blurry. GEN Energija is in charge of the construction of the second unit, and it is unclear why it is dragging its feet when it comes to this project.

Is it because it would like to see what will be best for citizens or to see what will be best for state-owned power companies, the newspaper wonders.

Even though the government supports the project in principle, it is becoming apparent that the second unit is not among its priorities.

Coalition parties have vowed in their agreement that they will respect the will of the people on this issue, but it is yet to be agreed on when exactly voters will decide on this in a referendum.

""This is true, on the one hand, but on the other, it is also true that people quickly forget, and the more time passes, the harder it will be to explain to the public the need for the country's energy self-sufficiency,"" says the commentary Fogging.

Slovenia spends less on education than OECD average,"Teachers are paid lower than an average employee with tertiary education in Slovenia and in the OECD in general. In Slovenia average wages of teachers in primary school reach 91-92% of an average wage of employees with tertiary education, depending on the age group taught. Wages of high school teachers are at 94% of the average wage of a person with tertiary education, while those of kindergarten teachers and assistants are at 73%.

Starting wages of Slovenian teachers are under the OECD average if purchasing power is taken into account, however Slovenian teachers at the top of the pay scale are paid more than is the OECD average.

In Slovenia 46% of adults aged between 25 and 34 attained the highest level of education in a vocational programme. For 38% that was secondary vocational education and for 8% tertiary vocational education.

Vocational education is most prevalent in Austria where it is the highest level of education for more than 50% of the population aged 25 to 34, while in countries like the US and Mexico it is the highest level of education for less than 5%.

Those with a vocational education have a lower rate of unemployment. In Slovenia 5.1% of people between the ages of 25 and 34 with a vocational education are homeless, compared to 9.4% of those that completed a general secondary education.

Slovenia is below the OECD average when it comes to adults without secondary education. In Slovenia the share is at 5%, while in the OECD it is at 14%.

Among Slovenians between the ages of 15 and 19, 27% are enrolled in general secondary education, 52% in vocational secondary education, 3% in primary education and 12% in tertiary education.

Trade unions find violations in 30% of pay slips reviewed,"Mostly, the violations referred to the commuting costs, payment of length-of-service allowances, payment of the difference to the minimum wage, and paying out of overtime work.

The campaign has shown that pay slips are still not incomprehensible to workers, the ZSSS said.

""It is not insignificant, either, that quite a few of the visitors did not want to reveal which company they work for,"" said the ZSSS, which stressed that confidentiality was always assured and that no steps were ever taken without the worker's consent.

Based on the number of question the ZSSS received during its open house campaign and the irregularities found, additional training will be organised for the workers, while the Labour Inspectorate will be urged to conduct targeted inspections at companies.

Although pay slips may differ among companies, they must all contain the basic data on the pay, allowances, reimbursement of work-related costs and other benefits, as well as data on the payment of taxes and social security contributions, and the payday, the union said.

ZSSS head Lidija Jerkič said that complex play slips that differ among companies made it harder for workers to see how much they are being paid for their work.",labour,labour

Court finds dismissal of fmr Forest Service head unlawful,"Oražem was dismissed by the Janez Janša government in September 2020 on the proposal of the then Agriculture Minister Aleksandra Pivec. He had been in charge of the Forest Service since 2013.

Limited supply of cars main reason for record low sales,"The lower supply of new cars and a drop in imports of used cars resulted in higher prices and long delivery times.

Due to the war in Ukraine, car companies had considerable problems obtaining car parts, especially semiconductors but also others.

""This had an impact on delivery times for new cars, which were extremely long, especially for certain models. Many customers did not get the car they wanted.""

AMSZ notes the resemblance with the times in former Yugoslavia when a new car was hard to get even if the buyer had the money.

The prices of new cars increased last year due to higher production costs, yet since Slovenian car distributors and car dealers offered lower discounts, they finished the year with above-the-average results.

A reason for the low sales of new cars was also a drop in exports of new cars that were registered for the first time in Slovenia to foreign markets.

AMSZ says that it was more profitable for car distributors and car dealers to sell the cars on the domestic market then export them.

In recent years, around a third of newly registered cars were exported from Slovenia.

AMZS noticed another trend last autumn as potential buyers came much less often to car dealerships selling used cars, ""which is a sign of the market cooling down because it no longer wants accept such high prices of used cars"".","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Slovenia to support fishermen in dispute against Croatia at Human Rights Court,"Fajon said after a closed-door session of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee that Slovenia would strive to protect the fishermen who are victims of Croatia's ignoring of the arbitration decision.

The ECHR notified Slovenia at the end of March that three complaints against Croatia filed by the Slovenian fishermen alleging violations of the European Convention on Human Rights had been served on Croatia. ""The Foreign and European Affairs Ministry welcomes the fact that the court has found the complains of Slovenian fishermen admissible and that they will be processed,"" Fajon said.

She explained that the government decided this month to become an intervener in the case. ""This sends an important signal that we will stand by Slovenian fishermen in all ongoing proceedings,"" she added.

Under the European Convention on Human Rights, the member state of the complainants has the right to submit written remarks and participate in all hearings of cases before the Chamber or the Grand Chamber of the ECHR.

Slovenia informed the ECHR of its intervention on 5 June ahead of the 16 June deadline. The court will now set a deadline for Slovenia's application after receiving Croatia's reply, the Foreign Ministry said.

The Croatian authorities have been issuing fines to Slovenian fishermen because Croatia does not recognise the decision of the border arbitration tribunal, which awarded most of the Piran Bay to Slovenia. Croatia insists the border runs through the middle of the bay.

The fishermen turned to the ECHR after exhausting all legal options for appeal in Croatia, including an appeal at the Croatian Constitutional Court.

A fisherman told the STA the Croatian rulings were a burden for the fishermen, including psychologically. The fines come every day, he said, adding they had stopped counting them.",human interest,human interest

Delo says Logar will likely get activated soon,"The previous poll estimating public support for the government caused a stir in the Freedom Movement as the ruling party was overtaken by Janez Janša's Democrats (SDS). What followed was the announcements of abolishing top-up health insurance and refunding fines issued for breaching Covid rules under the previous government, restrictions that were since declared unconstitutional.

""And the result? Support for the largest coalition party slightly rose. But same as one swallow does not make a summer, the first month of upturning declining support in ratings does not yet guarantee an ongoing trend.""

The latest Mediana survey also shows that the government's performance got slightly better ratings. Besides the above-mentioned reasons the cause for this could be PM Robert Golob's and his team's decision to talk less and do more. ""Less can be more in politics too.""

What will happen next hinges significantly on how burdened the middle class will be, since it is the middle class that is most likely to bear the financial brunt of the planned reforms, including the coming health reform.

The commentary believes that the ruling coalition will surely have to show more when it comes to this reform as it notes long wait times in healthcare.

Nevertheless, Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan unseated Anže Logar, SDS MP and former foreign minister, at the top of the most popular politicians list.

Logar ""will have to do something to preserve his political capital gained during the (2022) presidential election. He is said to do that using a cooperation platform which would probably be the start of a new political party that he and his followers would set up.""

Since ""the Pavel Rupar project"" evidently backfired on Janša, Logar, who has been invisible in recent months, is likely to get activated shortly, says the commentary Anže Logar Will Have to Get Activated.",politics,politics

Slovenian households save less in 2022,"According to Eurostat, in 2022 the share of gross savings in the gross disposable income was the highest in Germany at 19.9% and the lowest in Slovakia at 5.2%. Slovenia had the fifth highest share, just slightly above the Eurozone (13.5%) and EU (12.6%) averages.

Nominal growth of disposable income continued in all countries, in Slovenia it was at 9.8%, higher than both the Eurozone and EU averages, at 6.4% and 7.2%, respectively.

Household expenditure increased as well, growing by 14% in Slovenia, which is higher than the Eurozone (11.5%) and EU (12%) averages.

After financial assets of households grew by a record 12.3% in 2021, the growth slowed to 3.8% in 2022 as the financial assets amounted to EUR 73.6 billion. Bank deposits were the main contributor to the increase.

The ratio of household financial assets to GDP was on the rise for seven years but dropped significantly in 2022 (by 6.6 percentage points). Household financial assets in Slovenia represented 129.1% of GDP, which was significantly lower than the Eurozone (216,2%) or EU (212.1%) average.

Bishops oppose assisted suicide,"The people who are ill and suffering require comprehensive care and assistance, as because of their distress they may no longer see the meaning in their existence, Globokar said.

Those who are by their side must listen to them, take note of their wishes and values, and ease their suffering with medicine and by human closeness, he said, calling for comprehensive palliative care.

Human life must not be valued based on the person's usefulness, health, ability to make autonomous decisions or cost of treatment, he stressed. ""Every human being, regardless of the medical condition, has the dignity that protects them from the possibility of anyone interfering in their life,"" Globokar said.

By distinguishing between a worthy and unworthy human life ""we would bury a fundamental civilizational gain, which guarantees inviolability of every human life"". This would also change the fundamental mission of doctors, nurses and other medical staff.

A patient's decisions also affect others and the patient is always under the influence of other people, including medical staff, relatives and the wider society, he warned.

Globokar said the commission supported the proposal in the bill that would enable patients to decide on their treatment and also reject invasive therapies if they are seen as pointless.

For the elderly, ill and vulnerable the option of assisted suicide could create pressure and they could start to feel they are obligated to end their life to relieve their relatives and those who care after them of their duties, the commission wrote in a statement.

Among the parliamentary parties only the Left expressed its support for the proposal. The other two ruling coalition parties, the Freedom Movement and the Social Democrats, called for an in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, the opposition Democrats (SDS) are strongly opposed and New Slovenia (NSi) propose focusing on improving and enhancing palliative care rather than such a divisive proposal.",human interest,human interest
Finance Committee nods to revised 2023 budget to secure EUR 520m in relief funds,"While EUR 300 million of the total sum will mainly come from unused reserves for potential recapitalisations of state-owned companies, an increase in government budget expenditure was required for the remaining EUR 220 million.

While this will result in the deficit expressed as a share in the country's GDP increasing from 4.5% to 4.9%, Fiscal Council head Davorič Kračun told the committee that the revisions, coming in the wake of the recent devastating floods, were sensible.

Kračun however noted that this was only a first step in the budgetary financing of the massive financial consequences of the floods. The real scope will become much more apparent when the budget documents for 2024 and 2025 are prepared in the autumn.

""While emergency measures are indeed vital, these should also be targeted to ensure the efficient use of public money and to prevent any misuse of public funds to the greatest extent possible,"" Kračun moreover warned.

His points were echoed by the members of the committee, with Aleksander Reberšek of the opposition New Slovenia (NSi) arguing that ""the manner in which these funds will be used is crucial"" even if the sum could be more ambitious.

Coalition MPs agreed that strong oversight is paramount and Lenart Žavbi of the senior coalition Freedom Movement noted that the relief legislation being adopted in parliament this week envisaged the obligation of the state to disclose all aid recipients.

As for the sum itself, Žavbi said it only addressed the costs of the rescue efforts and the very start of post-flood reconstruction. The bulk of the costs will fall to the national budget for 2024 as well as the three or more annual budgets to follow.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Share of youth at risk of depression rising,"A comparison of the findings of the survey, which the NIJZ conducts every year in cooperation with the World Health Organisation, before and after the Covid-19 pandemic shows that the share of youth aged 11, 13, 15 and 17 with high likelihood of depression has risen.

Almost 36% of the youth reported that they experience at least two psychosomatic symptoms regularly (on a weekly basis), the NIJZ says on its website. The most frequent symptoms are neurosis, insomnia and irritation.

In the last 20 years, the percentage of adolescents who rate their health as excellent has decreased. Feelings of loneliness, which are more prevalent among girls, increase with age. The percentage of adolescents with high levels of anxiety symptoms is also increasing, the survey has found.

Severe anxiety is experienced by more girls and 15- and 17-year-olds. The latter are also more at risk of depression than boys and younger adolescents.

""Between 2018 and 2022, three mental health indicators deteriorated, with the percentage of adolescents aged 11, 13, 15 and 17 with an increased likelihood of depression rising from 13% to 30%, and the percentage of adolescents who are very satisfied with life falling,"" said Helena Jeriček Klanšček, the lead author of the survey.

The international survey, conducted in more than 50 countries, covers a wide range of behaviours - from risk behaviours, lifestyle, sleeping habits, school experiences, family relationships, to self-rated health, mental health, use of digital technologies, violence, etc. According to the NIJZ, the survey provides a basis for planning strategies and action in these fields.",social issue,social issue
Injured caver rescued in 30-hour effort,"Sandi Curk, the head of the regional civil protection headquarters for the Notranjska region, said the injured caver had normal pulse rate and blood pressure when she was brought out of the cave on a stretcher.

The woman, a member of a local speleology club, had been unconscious since a large stone fell on her head on Saturday evening, piercing her helmet. A medical team descended into the chasm to provide her with emergency care.

It took rescuers four hours and five minutes to extract her on a stretcher from the site of the accident at a depth of about 100 metres. She was then transported to Cerknica, in south-central Slovenia, with an ambulance before an army helicopter took her to UKC Ljubljana.

""This way we ensured that she received medical care as quickly as possible and avoided the morning rush hour and the risk of further accidents,"" said Curk, who praised the work of the paramedics in extremely challenging conditions.

The injured caver was brought out of the cave at around 4am this morning, Walter Zakrajšek, head of the cave rescue service at the Slovenian Caving Association, told the STA. More information will be available at a press conference in Cerknica at around noon today.

The injured caver was part of a group of six members of the Rakek speleology club who were exploring as yet unknown parts of Vranjedol Cave, a newly discovered cave near Cerknica. She was an experienced caver with more than a decade of experience.

After she was hit unconscious by a falling rock, a member of the group climbed out of the cave to get help, while the others stayed with her and helped her. She was unconscious throughout, but a doctor found she was responsive to pain stimuli.

New foreign policy strategy discussed by strategic council,"While the ministry did not reveal the contents of the emerging new strategy, the newspaper Delo reported today it favoured qualified majority decision-making in EU foreign policy.

The document reportedly also emphasises climate change and green transition, while feminist foreign policy, initially promoted by Fajon, has been somewhat sidelined.

In spring, Fajon said the ministry would put strong emphasis on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls around the world in the new foreign policy strategy.

The document is said by Delo to have shrunk from the initial 40 pages to around 10, while the government would like to have it adopted before Slovenia assumes its non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council on 1 January.

The council met in an expanded format today, meaning that former foreign ministers were also present.

The strategy currently in place is fairly recent, having been adopted at the end of 2021 under previous Foreign Minister Anže Logar.

But Fajon announced a new strategy, arguing the document would position Slovenia back among core EU countries.

Diplomat Iztok Mirošič was initially in charge of drafting the strategy. But even before he became ambassador to the US this summer, Sabina Stadler Repnik, head of the ministry's office for strategic studies and analysis, took over the drafting of the strategy from him.",politics,politics
Slovenia to shortly present informal guidelines on UN policy,"She said talks with President Nataša Pirc Musar, Prime Minister Robert Golob and other senior officials were under way. Informal guidelines are being discussed that could be presented in a week, she said.

""It is also our wish to set up a broader coordination group involving all state institutions and civil society that could contribute to and participate in the project,"" she said.

Fajon noted that she would conduct talks with both the outgoing and the newly elected non-permanent members until the end of the year as part of Slovenia's preparations for the 2024-2025 stint in the Council.

""This year, we have held talks with many countries and virtually all members of the UN Security Council, with conflict prevention being the main topic. We will have to respond to global crises all the time and work to prevent conflicts, including by providing humanitarian and material aid and respecting international law and human rights,"" Fajon said.

In the context of conflict prevention, she stressed the importance of water diplomacy. ""For us, efforts for peace and security in the region will also be crucial. This means ending Russian aggression in Ukraine as soon as possible and ensuring stability in the Western Balkans,"" she said.

Slovenia was elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2024-2025 on 6 June, getting 153 votes in the first round of voting to beat Belarus in the Eastern European group. Slovenian political leaders hailed the result as a major diplomatic success.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
NGOs up in arms as CETA ratification returns on govt agenda,"CETA has been provisionally applied since September 2017, and is expected to be fully and permanently applied once it is ratified by all EU member states. Slovenia is among the ten member states which are yet to ratify the agreement.

The newspaper Delo has reported that the government coalition is expected to discuss ratification this week, with the Foreign Ministry to propose ratification at the initiative of the Economy Ministry.

Delo notes that the Foreign Ministry is headed by Tanja Fajon, the former member of the European Parliament (MEP) who, in this capacity, expressed doubt that CETA will ever be implemented in its entirety and even voted against it.

As the agreement returns to the political agenda, non-governmental organisations, which have constantly been fiercely opposed to CETA, have spoken up again.

The Plan B for Slovenia network addressed a call to President Nataša Pirc Musar, parliamentary Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič and Prime Minister Robert Golob for the Constitutional Court to be asked about the compliance of CETA with the Constitution before the ratification.

The NGO thinks that the agreement is not in line with the constitutional provision stipulating that water sources serve primarily and sustainably to supply drinking water and water for households and are not marketable goods in this respect.

It noted that ""CETA defines concessions for the extraction of natural resources as investments, which can be understood as marketable goods.""

Based on this definition and other provisions of CETA, the NGO does not exclude the possibility of a potential arbitration dispute on water resources where a concession for extraction of water is (or will be) granted in the future.

It noted the example of hydraulic fracturing in Petišovci (NE), where Ascent Resources initiated an arbitration dispute against Slovenia due to the decision of the Environment Agency requiring an environmental impact assessment, as part of which the UK investor seeks EUR 500 million in damages.

""The Slovenian public and civil society are very sensitive when it comes to water and its protection. This was confirmed by the high turnout and unity of voters in the referendum on the amendments of the waters act,"" the NGO said.

Arguing that the ratification of the agreement would cause an ""economic, social and environmental disaster"", the Alpe Adria Green and Healthy Society NGOs said that CETA should be decided on in Slovenia in a referendum.

They added that ""treating people, natural resources and public services as commodities on the market is inadmissible, as this threatens the nation's existence. This is a crime.""

Delo said last week that it is not yet clear whether the coalition parties will be united when it comes to the ratification.

Unlike Fajon, the SD ""reservedly supported"" the agreement at the time of its signing, while the Left, in addition to the issue of water resources, also took issue with the introduction of the investment court system (ICS), which - as critics claim - could enable multinationals to avoid national courts.

The ICS mechanism, which is exempted from the provisional application, was discussed at the request of Belgium by the EU Court of Justice, which ruled that it is compatible with EU law.

Igor Šoltes, the former MEP and currently the head of the SD advisory council for justice, has told Delo that ""thorough consideration of what this means for Slovenia and what for the EU is required before any consensus is reached.""

The newspaper notes that, as member of the Greens group in the European Parliament, Šoltes opposed not only to CETA, but also to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) which, unlike CETA, has been shelved.",politics,politics
Ministry acting on driving licence issue affecting minority in Italy,"The ministry said this in response to a question from ruling coalition MPs who noted that members of the Slovenian ethnic minority in Italy have to pay extra to have their name written with č, š, ž - the three Slovenian letters the Italian alphabet does not have - when extending their driving licence.

The three Freedom Movement MPs asked Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon how she plans to act to stop such injustice being done to minority members.

The ministry replied that, through its diplomatic and consular missions, it ""closely monitors the situation and the exercise of the rights of the Slovenian community arising from Italy's obligations under international law and its national legislation"".

The ministry has repeatedly called on the Italian authorities to convene a meeting of a body that gives Slovenian minority members direct access to the Italian government as soon as possible, but the body has not yet met under the current Italian government.

Fajon has also specifically drawn the attention of her Italian counterpart, Antonio Tajani, to this issue during his visit to Ljubljana on 17 March.

The body, which falls under the remit of the Italian Ministry of Home Affairs, allows Slovenian minority members to discuss all issues as they arise with government members directly, including issues such as the Slovenian lettering in driving licences.

The correct spelling of names is enshrined in Italian legislation, the ministry pointed out. ""The problem that has arisen with the spelling of the Slovenian letters in the extension of driving licences is part of a series of technical and administrative inconsistencies on the part of the relevant Italian authorities,"" the ministry said.

""The flaws occurred in the issuance of certain types of identity documents in the processes of digitisation in the public administration,"" the ministry explained, promising to continue to draw Italy's attention to the unacceptability of such errors.",social issue,social issue
Delo says issues with Croatia sidelined to benefit business,"Golob is trying to provide an additional boost to the relations by building on record trade figures and by looking to the future, leaving a number of unresolved issues, including the border, for a more advantageous time.

The answer to the question who benefits from not addressing issues is simple: Croatia, because it is in its interest that they remain unresolved.

Slovenia's neighbour to the south ""does not recognise the arbitration award that set the border between the countries and is punishing Slovenian fishermen for fishing in Slovenian territorial waters.""

It also does not take over the proportionate share of radioactive waste from the jointly-owned Krško nuclear power plant. Moreover, Croatian companies are better off not having to repay their debt to the defunct Ljubljanska Banka.

But being a pragmatist, Golob has come to realise that it is better to do business with Croatia than to fight it in court.

The planned second nuclear generator and a gas terminal in Krk will be excellent opportunities to do business, the paper says under the headline Time for Business in Slovenia-Croatian Relations.",politics,politics

SocDem think-tank to be launched next week,"The new think-tank plans to partner with other EU SocDem institutes such as the German Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Austrian Karl Renner Institut, Swedish Olaf Palme Center and the Foundation for Progressive European Studies, which brings together related foundations at EU level, said Kopač, a former labour minister.

The core of the think-tank is currently a 10-member expert council, which includes university professors and PhD holders in the fields of law, sociology, economics and history, as well as individuals who have contributed significantly to the development of Slovenian politics in the past, including former MP Rado Bohinc, historian Božo Repe, founder of the Women's Lobby Sonja Lokar, and Helena Kamnar, former president's economic advisor.

""This is the intellectual basis which is to conduct a responsible dialogue also wider,"" said Kopač.

The new institute will be based at the headquarters of the junior coalition party Social Democrats (SD) in Levstikova Street, while according to web portal N1 the SD is moving to a new building in Nazorjeva Street in Ljubljana's city centre.

The villa at 15 Levstikova Street will be renamed the House of Progressive Ideas and will also be home to other NGOs such as the Institute for Economic Democracy.

The new think-tank will host a conference in Ljubljana on 25 May where key EU issues, social-democratic ideas and the role of political foundations in supporting European integration and shaping public policies will be discussed with guests from similar political foundations from other countries.

Pundit feels Putin in fact stronger after defused mutiny,"As many are drawing parallels between Saturday's rebellion of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his mercenary Wagner Group and the attempted coup at the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 or the constitutional crisis two years later, Grošelj said the fear of a return to those unstable times is very present in Russia.

According to him, the unusual resolution of the crisis solidified Putin's status, since he had successfully legitimised his power over the past decades precisely with the argument of Russia being a stable country internally under his leadership.

The former Defence Ministry state secretary, who feels that Prigozhin does not have enough clout to lead to country, moreover argued that the compromise allegedly reached through the mediation of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko could have negative consequences for Ukraine and the entire world.

He noted that people close to Wagner are now likely to become part of the Russian establishment. More specifically, these political and military forces are expected to gain additional influence within the Russian Defence Ministry.

Groželj pointed out that it was precisely Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov who were the targets of criticism by Prigozhin in recent months. Changes in the balance of power within the military could lead to an escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Positions of power could be occupied by individuals with imperial ambitions and generals with combat experience, the analyst warned.

It is not yet clear whether the situation suits Putin, he added, while arguing developments in Russia are too often analysed in black and white terms abroad, while the reality is much more complex. For example, the son of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov fought in Wagner, while Sergei Surovikin, until recently commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, was seen as a supporter of Prigozhin's interests.

Despite the intense fighting that has been taking place in Ukraine over the last 16 months, Grošelj warns that ""this war could get even more brutal"". He does not rule out the use of nuclear weapons.

The Wagner troops are likely to retain their status as a strike force in Ukraine, fighting the toughest battles, but they will probably be integrated into the Russian army, Grošelj believes.

This is however unlikely to affect the status of the Wagner Group as a private army pursuing Kremlin's interests abroad, the expert added. This is because this helps Russia maintain influence in countries such as Mali or the Central African Republic without the presence of its own army. Russia takes care of training and logistical requirements of Wagner, while Wagner provides its own funding through mining concessions in the countries where it intervenes, he explained.

As for the situation in Ukraine, Grošelj said the Russian army has been able to consolidate defensive positions which the Ukrainian counter-offensive has been trying to break through unsuccessfully in recent weeks.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Paper suggests founding new flag carrier,"Data from FAB Central Europe shows that 20% more air planes will fly over Slovenia from the the end of March compared to 2019, while flights to Slovenia will drop by around 40%.

Ljubljana airport's poor connectivity is partly due to the passivity of airport operator Fraport Slovenija to attract new airlines whose based would be in Ljubljana.

Only three air lines - Transavia, Finnair and Aegean Airlines - have announced a return to Brnik, and transport has stagnated also compared to 2022, when some Covid restrictions were still in place, which means the airport does much worse than comparable airports in the region.

The government is meanwhile willing to give EUR 16.8 million for connectivity in three years, but the first positive effects could only be seen at the end of the summer season.

The Infrastructure Ministry has commissioned two studies on connectivity but neither seems to focus directly on examining the possibility to set up a new flag carrier.

In the meantime pressure for better connectivity is increasing, especially from business, as business partners are avoiding meetings in Slovenia due to poor connections.

Many of those who have forgotten about the torments of the poor management of defunct flag carrier Adria Airways wonder why the government does not give connectivity subsidies to a new flag carrier.

Aviation experts believe that such a company will never make profit, so a decision on it will always be a political one. But in deciding whether to found it or not the government should take into account broader implications, from a potential shortfall of revenue and a creation of indirect jobs to the impact on the events industry.

""It would also make sense for all those who have the most to gain from connectivity to help finance it. In short, if you want an airline, think about how you are willing to co-finance it.""","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

"Večer comments on Belgrade shooting, hate speech in Slovenia","Under the headline Reflection in the Mirror, the paper says many see the Belgrade school shooting as a reflection of ""Vučić's Serbia"".

By that, they mean primitivism, aggression, vulgarity and violence-mongering, reflecting from politics into reality TV and the media, which have more or less become political propaganda outlets.

Slovenia cannot be happy with its hate speech situation either. This week, a so-called pensioners' rally was held once again, the paper notes, adding the media should seriously ask themselves whether ""the ideas of the main protagonist of the rally"" really deserved as much space.

Večer is referring here to Pavel Rupar, who said at the rally on Wednesday that Biserka Marolt Meden, an adviser to the president, ""must be removed"" over her involvement in a proposed bill enabling assisted dying.",politics,disaster and accident
Peer violence case grabs headlines (adds),"While police were tight-lipped about the details of the incident, Radio Slovenija reported about the footage, which has been making rounds on social media, showing the incident starting inside a shopping centre and then continuing outside, on a roof.

The 13-year-old was reportedly punched in the face by a girl, while more attackers joined later. Several youngsters filmed the violence but nobody decided to help the victim. Radio Slovenija added that unofficial claims on social media suggest the posting of intimate photos of one of the girls had led to the incident.

Boštjan Kavc of the Celje Police Administration told the press that police conducted regular activities at schools aiming to raise awareness about peer violence and the need to report it. A report about this incident was filed by the girl and her mother.

Kavc moreover explained that verbal and online violence, very often involving photos and videos, are the main forms of violence among young people.

""Verbal and psychological violence is a serious form of violence and minors as very vulnerable victims of these crimes can suffer serious consequences,"" he added.

Of all the crimes committed by minors in the Celje area last year, the highest in number were violent crimes, threats and crimes against sexual inviolability. However, the number of these offences like the display, production and possession of pornographic material, is decreasing, police officials said.

After a drop in the number of peer violence cases at the level of the entire country in 2021 - which is typical of most offences in general - the number of cases handled by police officers last year was close to pre-Covid-19 levels. They dealt with 308 cases last year, compared to 220 the year before, and 306 in 2020. The figure for the first three months of this year is 123.

The number of minors aged between 14 and 18 who were suspected of committing violence against other minors was 384 last year, which compares to 416 in 2020 and to 485 in 2019.

While also calling on parents to take on their share of responsibility, police have noted that the internet and widespread use of electronic devices, in particular mobile phones, have introduced new dimensions to peer violence. After being subject to direct violence, children can also suffer under horrifying long-lasting indirect violence if the incident is recorded and spread widely and fast on the internet.

Meanwhile, a response to the incident has also come from the High School Students' Organisation, which called for effective preventive measure on the part of society. Not wishing to comment on the specific case, it said it would always ""stand by the fact that the generations of today are not the same as the generations of yesteryear"".

Delo happy to see culture and democracy going hand in hand,"The international conference on the shores of Lake Bled this year included a discussion on culture, with the programme of the ""two-day regional Davos"" featuring a round table dubbed No Culture, No Democracy!, the newspaper notes.

Considering the expected principled, well-intentioned nature of the debates, it was almost refreshing to see that the speakers - including the Slovenian culture minister - used thoughtful words to spread the mantra that culture is a key element, if not a foundation of democracy.

The words by former European Parliament President David Sassoli that culture will bring people back together after the trauma of the pandemic could be confirmed by Minister Asta Vrečko who, after inspecting the damage caused by the recent floods, saw the hope that after the worst is over, a desire for culture will spring up.

Police commissioner denies accusations of perjury,"Media reported that Jušič, in his capacity as deputy head of the Koper Police Department's criminal police, demanded a transfer of a detective as a retaliation.

The detective subsequently sued Jušić, and when Jušić was questioned in court he denied having demanded the transfer, but the court believed three other witnesses who claimed the contrary.

The detective won the case and after an appeal from the police a higher court confirmed the first-instance ruling.

""I did not lie in court, these are blatant untruths and malicious allegations, which I strongly and firmly reject,"" the General Police Directorate quoted Jušić as saying in response to Thursday's report aired on TV Slovenija's Odmevi news show.

""Perjury is a criminal offence under the penal code and a despicable act that I absolutely condemn and have never committed as a citizen and a police officer,"" Juršić was quoted as saying.

The allegations of Jušić's alleged perjury were also reviewed by the Ljubljana District Court and the Specialised State Prosecutor's Office a few years ago.

Both concluded that the comprehensive evidence gathered did not point to perjury, the General Police Directorate said, enclosing both documents.

""Recently, there have been media attacks and discrediting of me for some other 'old' cases and, as in this case, there have been unjustified and malicious accusations of my involvement in illegal acts,"" Jušić wrote.

He stressed that ""such unverified, unsubstantiated, misleading and malicious allegations"" are not only damaging to him but also to the institution of the Police Commissioner, which he finds unacceptable.

""I have always striven to carry out my duties and exercise my powers lawfully, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and act in a way that does not infringe the rights of staff and others. This is my guiding principle, these are my views and my way of working,"" Jušić said.

Croatian company acquires Sola and Zala soft drink brands (adds),"The contract, the value of which has not been disclosed, includes the transfer of the brands, production and distribution of products.

""With the sale of the two brands, Pivovarna Laško Union will reduce the complexity of production and simplify its operations. This will allow the company to focus more on ensuring sustainable growth in beer-making and distribution,"" the brewery said in a press release on Friday.

The Sola and Zala soft drinks will continue to be made in Ljubljana at least until the end of September, but it remains unclear what will happen to the employees working for the two brands.

Pivovarna Laško Union noted that they will take great care in answering questions regarding employees in close cooperation with social partners, adding that this was a a priority for the company.

Stanić Beverages has been a partner in the production and distribution of Sola products for years. ""Consequently they are devoted to a long-term development of both brands by ensuring a continued high quality of products,"" the brewery said.

The brewery is based close to the Ljubljana city centre and has limited possibilities for further long-term development and expansion of production at the location. This is what prompted the sale of the brands, said Pivovarna Laško Union CEO Zooullis Mina.

""Our Evergreen strategy calls for us to focus on our main beer brewing activity and to reduce our complexity,"" he added. The company will remain the distributor for Sola and Zala in Slovenia.

Mina noted that the company will stay present in Ljubljana with the museum and the Union brewery as the brand's centre of excellence. ""Ljubljana was and will continue to be the cradle and the home of our brand Union,"" Mina added.

Although the beer production is moving to the brewery in Laško, ahead of any potential sale of Ljubljana premises, the company ""first wants to involve stakeholders, including the local community, the city of Ljubljana and experts that will show interest for the future development of our premises in Ljubljana,"" said Mina.

Pivovarna Union Laško will continue to make investments in Slovenia through a three-year EUR 30 million investment plan, including the acquisition of distributor Davidov Hram. Further investment is planned to make the brewery Laško one of the largest Heineken brewery in the region.

"Employers claiming wage compensation for over 14,000 workers post-floods","Employers filed 2,110 applications for wage compensation for 14,415 workers between 17 August and 7 September in three different categories.

Most of them are related to a partial compensation due to force majeure (9,197 workers) and furloughed workers (4,547), both under the first emergency act passed post-floods.

The second emergency law introduced wage compensation for workers reassigned to do post-flood clear-ups with the employer.

Employers have between 4 and 18 September to apply for aid in this category, and in the first four days alone, 67 employers filed applications for 671 employees.

Furloughed workers are also compensated 80%, but not below the minimum wage, and the measure is in place until the end of the year, with the option of extension.

For this category of workers, employers will receive only 80% of the wage they will pay to the workers, and the highest state compensation is capped with the average salary in May 2023.

BRDO PRI KRANJU - Prime Minister Robert Golob and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon announced a shift in Slovenia's foreign policy that involves not just a return to the orbit of core EU countries but also a more global perspective. Golob expects expertise and courage from diplomats and thinks that Slovenian foreign policy should turn its focus to the world. He would like Slovenia to explore how it can contribute to world peace and progress.

Official analysis confirms pollution with heavy metals in Koroška,"The official analysis of flood silt in the upper Meža Valley, between Črna na Koroškem and Dravograd, was conducted by the Jožef Stefan Institute.

In the 11 samples of the silt and mud deposited by the Meža River the acceptable levels of potentially toxic elements, including zinc, cadmium and lead, which are present in the Meža Valley because of a lead and zinc mine, which was closed in the early 1990s, have been exceeded, Tea Zuliani from the institute said.

Janja Turšič from the Environment Agency said the results showed really high contents of lead, cadmium and zinc in the soil. In all of the samples lead levels in particular exceeded the critical level.

Data from samples taken in the upper Meža Valley in recent years showed that the soil in the area had been contaminated with lead in the past, as well as cadmium and zinc. However, the results of the latest analysis suggest that this material has moved downstream. In fact, the soil along the Meža River has very similar concentrations of these metals as the samples taken after the floods at the beginning of August, Turšič said.

""These results are not surprising,"" said Ivan Eržen, head of the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ). More than 20 years ago, a study was carried out to determine the impact of the environment on the health of the population, which found that the impact was significant, especially in young children, who are very sensitive and are still developing. At the time, almost 80% of the children who took part in the study were found to have excess levels of lead in their blood.

Subsequently, a programme was launched to address this issue, including efforts to reduce people's exposure and intake of lead. In the 15 years of the programme, significant improvements were recorded.

The NIJZ is striving to continue this programme as part of the post-flood efforts. Immediately after the floods, people were urged to protect and wash their hands when dealing with the silt or mud. They were also urged to sprinkle surfaces with water to avoid dusting and close their windows. Children were banned from helping with the clean-up.

The Agriculture Institute advises that all crops affected by flooding be thrown away, Eržen said.

Tanja Bolte, head of the environment directorate at the Environment Ministry, said that activities regarding a new programme of measures to address the pollution issue in the upper Meža Valley were already under way. Probably the programme will need to be expanded to include not only Mežica, Črna and Žerjav but all other municipalities as well.

When the area is cleaned, an analysis will be conducted and measures prepared, she said.

Head of the Environment and Energy Inspectorate Mirana Omerzu also confirmed media reports that the floods exposed another environmentally-problematic practice from the past - empty car battery cases buried into the riverbank of the Meža in the town of Mežica.

The inspectorate launched a procedure against battery producer TAB Mežica over this, she said. The company said that these were empty car battery cases that had been produced for a foreign company around 1980 and thrown away for not meeting the quality standards. The broken plastic battery cases were dumped there 40 or 45 years ago, the inspectors found.

Omerzu said measures would be taken in line with the law after a full investigation.

TAB CEO Roman Burja said today that the group's production facilities in Žerjav and Črna were not functioning due to maintenance work when the floods hit at the beginning of the month. No leakages have been detected, he said.

However, the company's warehouse of car batteries in Šentjanž was flooded and a large number of battery cases were seen floating in the Drava. Burja asserted these too were empty battery cases.

Commenting on the excessive levels of heavy metals found in the Meža Valley, he said that the valley had more than 350-year mining history, so it was difficult to point a finger at just one stakeholder. ""We know there were several deposit sites in the valley and it is difficult to say exactly which caused the contamination.""

Samples of the sediments, mud and soil have also been taken in other areas affected by the recent floods, including along the Kamniška Bistrica, Sora, Gradaščica, Sava, Krka, Mura, Drava and Savinja rivers. The results are expected to be in next week, Turšič said.",disaster and accident,environmental issue

Auditors find no wrongdoing in NGO referendum campaign funding,"The SDS youth wing claimed the 8 March Institute received EUR 30,000 from the Berlin-based Guerilla Foundation to fund the campaign ahead of the 2021 referendum on the waters act.

The Institute has rejected the claims when they were first made, saying that it had received the funds in April 2022, nearly a year after the campaign had ended, and that it had no contact with the German NGO before the referendum.

""We placed our bid for the funds three months after the referendum campaign had ended. The project we pitched was approved at the end of 2021, the contract was signed and the money transferred only in 2022, for the period between February 2022 and February 2023,"" the Institute said today.

The Institute believes that the SDS youth wing had fabricated the allegations with the goal of discrediting the NGO and to quiet critical voices.

Moreover, the NGO says that the party wing had not been interested in the fact that the referendum campaign finances had not been managed by the 8 March Institute but by the environmental NGO Ekokrog via a special bank account where donations were collected.

The 8 March Institute used just under EUR 3,000 for the water act referendum campaign, the NGO also said today. ""The SDS cannot face the fact that they have lost the referendum and that their government adopted a bill that was a threat to waters.""",environmental issue,environmental issue
Wolt refuses to enter talks on collective bargaining agreement,"The Trade Union of Food Delivery Couriers, formed last month to protect the rights and interests of food delivery couriers in Slovenia amid poor working conditions, called for negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement on 26 April.

The deadline for a reply expired yesterday. The union said that if the managements of the two delivery companies in Slovenia, Wolt and Glovo, will not be willing to talk to the union, it would be forced to step up union activity.

Wolt sent its reply on time, saying that there was no legal basis for entering collective bargaining under the current model of cooperation with delivery partners, who are self-employed.

Wolt noted it had last met the youth trade union Mladi Plus, under whose auspices the delivery curies' union was formed, in March. ""We made it clear at the time that we support the work of the European Commission at local and European levels in providing guidance to member states on paving the way for collective representation for the self-employed.

""We agree that it is good that the self-employed also have the opportunity to represent their interests,"" Wolt wrote.

It added that the satisfaction of couriers is extremely important, which is why the company will continue the dialogue with all stakeholders, including Mladi Plus.

Mladi Plus has been warning of poor working conditions at both Wolt and Glovo for a while, and has decided to set up the new trade union in April after the situation further deteriorated.

Wolt meanwhile claims that it constantly monitors the feed-back from couriers and works to improve the working conditions.",labour,labour

Valenčič said that more than 50 prosecutors, including himself, had challenged the government's decision at the Labour Court.

""First rulings regarding the pay cut for persecutors have been handed down. The Labour Court has fully sided with the prosecutors, which was expected following the Constitutional Court's decision,"" he said.

All prosecutors will now receive the pay they were deprived of in 2020, so they do not have to file any claims, he added. The sum in question is around EUR 450,000 gross and will be expectedly paid out in March or April.

The Association of Prosecutors warned the provisions were unconstitutional when they were passed, and asked the Constitutional Court to review them already in April 2020.

However, the top court decided not to process the petition on the grounds that the prosecutors had not yet exhausted all available legal means.

Some of the prosecutors then turned to the Labour Court, which itself petitioned the Constitutional Court as part of its deliberation on the case. It was based on this petition that the Constitutional Court ruled the measure unconstitutional.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Minister Boštjančič says previous govt made mess of Recovery and Resilience Plan,"The EUR 672 billion plan provides Slovenia with EUR 1.49 billion in grants and EUR 705 million in loans. So far, the country has received EUR 231 million in advances, while the first regular funds are expected in a few weeks.

Pointing the finger at the previous government, Boštjančič told the press that delays with regard to certain targets amount to more than 15 months at this point already. ""The previous government laid down a funds phasing plan and defined the essential milestones, but the problem is that the proposal was made hastily, without strategic steps and with a bad timetable,"" the minister said.

While the EU conceived the plan as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, enabling a recovery and preparation for potential future crises, Slovenia's plan is but ""a wish list, missing real projects that would really help recovery and resilience"", senior coalition Freedom Party MP Monika Pekošak added. She said it is packed with infrastructure projects and containing measures and deadlines that are too scattered and in fact unrealistic.

Boštjančič singled out the issue of building permits, noting these procedures are extremely complex and protracted in Slovenia. ""It was simply unrealistic to expect that, for example, by December 2022, we would have completed the tendering of all the contracts and projects for urban waste water discharge and treatment, or the tendering for the drinking water supply project.""

The minister moreover argued that the previous government had taken a completely misguided organisational approach. While in Croatia, for example, each of the country's six main pillars of action were entrusted to individual ministries, in Slovenia more than 10 ministries and different authorities are responsible for the four pillars. ""In practice, this means a lot of coordination between often uncoordinated ministries and other authorities,"" he said.

While also expecting liquidity issues due to the need for advance payments by the state in the face of the delays, Boštjančič remains confident that all targets will be met and all funds available secured by the end of 2026. ""I assure you we will do our best.""","economy, business and finance",politics
Education to get most of ex-education ministry's EUR 2.7bn funds,"The defunct ministry's funds will be distributed among the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation and the Ministry of the Economy, Tourism and Sport, State Secretary at the Ministry of Education Boris Černilec told the MPs.

The Ministry of Education, which is in charge of policies on kindergarten, primary and secondary school, is entitled to EUR 1.8 billion, or 11% of the national budget.

As much as 95% of this sum is intended for current transfers, such as funding of schools and kindergartens as well as subsidies for individuals and households.

As much as EUR 1.2 billion goes for primary schools, which is almost two-thirds of the ministry's entire budget, said Černilec.

EUR 426 million is intended for secondary schools, or 24% of the ministry's budget, while an additional EUR 19 million was secured for investment in secondary schools.

Pre-school education will get EUR 50 million, the most of which for subsidising kindergarten payments by parents for their second or any other further kid included in pre-school education.

A total of EUR 54 million is allocated for school meal subsidies for primary and secondary school children and for secondary school dorm fees.

The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation will get EUR 846 million, said Matjaž Krajnc, a state secretary at this ministry.

The figure is largely within the parameters for these three fields in the original 2023 national budget, he said, while an additional EUR 1.8 million has been secured to mitigate the consequences of the cost-of-living crisis.

Funds for science and information society have remained the same, at EUR 370 million, and technology and innovation will get EUR 425 million.

EUR 65 million is planned as part of the national recovery and resilience plan, largely to construct a new building for the Veterinary Faculty, according to Krajnc.

Alenka Jeraj, an MP for the opposition Democrats (SDS), noted that the funds for the new premises of the Faculty of Medicine from the recovery plan had been cut.

Krajnc said this is because this is one of the projects where delays could be expected due to potential complaints and reviews, but the ministry is looking for alternative sources of funding and the timeline of the project should not be affected.

Jeraj also inquired why the funds for the teaching profession had been cut, with Černilec saying a call for scholarships for professions in short supply yielded fewer applications than expected.",education,education
Agriculture minister discussing future of forests at ministerial,"The partnership of the four EU member states advocates a comprehensive approach to sustainable forest management that sees all functions of the forest - economic, environmental and social - as equally important.

The main objectives include informal dialogue in know-how exchange and understanding of how the European Commission operates, the Slovenian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food said in a press release.

Today's debate focused on the future of forests and the forestry sector in Europe. The ministers also signed a joint statement highlighting the increasingly apparent effects of climate change.

The health of forests must be strengthened long term to provide additional protection from natural disasters and ensure their ecosystemic functions in the future, the ministers believe, with Šinko describing the damage summer storms caused in Slovenian forests.

The joint statement underlined the importance of sustainable forest management and the strengthening of bioeconomy through sustainable use of forest products.

At the sidelines of the meeting, the ministers also met with a Japanese delegation, and attended the opening of Austrofoma, a forestry trade fair.",environmental issue,environmental issue
State to convert EUR 32m in claims to tourism holding Sava to equity,"The Slovenian Sovereign Holding (SSH), the state asset custodian, and KAD, a state-owned fund managed by SSH, will convert EUR 16 million in claims each, shows the assembly call published by Sava on Wednesday.

After already holding a combined 47%, SSH and KAD exercised their pre-emptive right to buy in 2022 a 43.2% stake for about EUR 38 million from York, a Luxembourg-based private fund which had reportedly planned to sell to a Hungarian investor.

Sava, owner of several spas around the country and hotels on the seaside and in Gorenjska, forms the core of a planned tourism holding, an idea that has been years in the making under consecutive governments.

Fiscal Council warns against measures excessively impacting fiscal position,"At 2.4% of GDP in the first three quarters of last year, the general government deficit was roughly half of what it was in same period of 2021. The key reason for this is the much reduced impact of Covid-19-related spending, the Fiscal Council said in its latest assessment of fiscal and macroeconomic developments.

However, projected economic developments and economic policy measures are weakening the outlook for this year, with European Commission forecasts putting Slovenia's deficit among the highest in the EU, added the body in charge of assessing the sustainability and compliance of fiscal policies with the fiscal rule.

Slovenian government bond spreads have been higher than those of comparable countries in recent months, the council wrote, while also speaking of the negative impact of the raising of public sector wages without measures to neutralise the ramifications.

Therefore, the council finds ensuring an effective and sustainable fiscal policy of utmost importance in the light of the many uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, the envisaged changes in the EU's economic governance system and the longer-term economic policy challenges.

Thus, pending the implementation of the announced public sector wage reform, all stakeholders should avoid solutions that would lead to further increases in labour costs compared to the situation before the adoption of the 2023 budget documents, the Fiscal Council wrote.

The general government deficit was 2.4% of GDP last year, a percentage point lower than projected. High investment activity contributed to the largest municipal deficit since 2010, despite stronger revenue growth.

The healthcare purse deficit was the highest on record, while the Fiscal Council noted that discretionary measures, together with the regular adjustment of pensions, increased pension expenditure by almost half a billion euros.

According to the Fiscal Council's assessment, last year's lower-than-forecasted budget deficit opens up a relatively large space for action this year. This raises the expectations of budget users for economic policy stimuli in the future, following the end of the epidemic period in which many groups benefited from regular income supplementation, and amid the high inflation, which the government is addressing with extensive but largely untargeted measures, the council wrote.

It believes that the effects of the public sector wage agreements made up to this point are still within the limits of the budget documents adopted for this year, but there is no room for additional agreements.

The council argued that some of the major components of the budget that are not flexible are underestimated in this year's budget. It thus expects the likely supplementary budget to be more realistic than last year, while not containing further increases in the expenditure ceilings.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Finance deems public sector pay unsustainable,"While making pay demands left and right, nobody in the public sector is really concerned about where the money comes from because the government will simply provide it.

""But the government will also take money. It will have to - through higher taxes and other duties ... God knows what kind of pension contributions we will pay, how high the payroll tax will be and how hard it will come down on taxation of property,"" the commentator says in Heaven under the Alps or Above-Average Wages for Everyone.

The paper believes this will lead to more expensive borrowing for the state, an uncertain business environment, and failure to achieve rapid growth of value added.

""Productivity, high value added - all that would mean that we could have higher wages in the public sector, in the corporate sector; even politicians would make more money if they managed to make our country more interesting for business,"" the paper says.

""But no, this is not happening. As if it is not enough that the world is in the throes of high inflation, uncertainty due to high energy prices, supply chain disruptions, the war in Ukraine. As if this is not enough, we have to deal with domestic failures and deepening distrust in the business environment.""","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
PM says up to EUR 7bn to be invested in post-flood reconstruction (adds),"Presenting a supplementary budget for 2023 in parliament, Golob said that the government would draft in the coming weeks a reconstruction bill under which between 6.7 and 7 billion euros would be allocated for this effort in the coming years.

The goal is not only to restore these areas to their previous state, but to rehabilitate to the extent where they will be ""significantly more resistant to similar natural disasters"", he added.

While EUR 520 million will be provided by means of the supplementation of this year's budget, European funds are expected to be the most important source, totalling around EUR 2 billion, including EUR 400 million in grants from the Solidarity Fund.

Golob added that EUR 750 million would come from additional loans from the EU Recovery and Resilience Mechanism.

The prime minister noted that he had already notified European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about the additional loans on Wednesday, adding that the relevant application would be formally sent to Brussels today.

In addition, the government expects to obtain around EUR 1.1 billion by redistributing the integral budget funds and making savings on the expenditure side, while around EUR 1.3 billion is expected to come from solidarity contributions.

Some EUR 350 million is expected to be directly covered by insurance companies in the form of damages paid out to the affected individuals and companies, Golob added.

He said that ""those who have more, also need to contribute more"", expressing the conviction that the financial plan is ""balanced, feasible and such that it will not interfere with development priorities"".

This view was echoed by Finance Minister Klemen Boštjančič as he spoke to the press on the sidelines of the parliamentary session.

He also said the cohesion programme for 2021-2027 will soon be revised as the government intends to obtain quite some funds by reprogramming priorities financed by cohesion funds in this seven-year period.

Additional borrowing will also be an important source of post-flood reconstruction, he said, but added that ""there are still many unknowns here"".

The state will borrow through the EU's recovery and resilience facility, a decision the government adopted yesterday, while talks on favourable loans have already started with multilateral banks such as the EBRD and the EIB, said Boštjančič.

And if parliament passes an amendment adopted by a relevant committee yesterday, the post-flood reconstruction fund should not get only EUR 150 million annually from the mandatory solidarity contribution, but EUR 5 to 6 million more, according to the finance minister.

Golob meanwhile also told parliament that the government had entrusted post-flood reconstruction to experts.

RTV Slovenija employees: Repairing damage will not be easy,"""We believe that the Constitutional Court decision recognises the significance of the public broadcaster for the people's constitutional right to be informed, the freedom of speech of employees and democracy in Slovenia,"" union head Helena Milinković said.

She expects the new council, which will replace the two existing governing bodies, to meet as soon as possible and start the hard work, because it will not be easy to repair the damage.

""The management is leaving scorched earth behind it, great damage, not only in terms of finances but in terms of staff as well,"" Milinković said.

She expressed expectation that the new management would follow public interest and re-establish dialogue with employees and all trade unions.

Moreover, the strike committee expects the new management to reach a strike agreement that will respect the rights of employees and the public, and programming and professional standards. It also expects the management to nurture honest and professional dialogue, said Milinković.

Workers' council chair Peter Pajek said he felt as if he were waking up from a nightmare. Free journalism is not self-evident when seemingly democratic governments undermine the independence of the legal system, limit the freedom of journalists and portray any opposition as betrayal.

But the real challenges are still ahead, he said, promising the council will remain vigilant also in the future.

Alenka Potočnik, the president of the Journalists' Trade Union urged the next management and council to draw up a repair plan so that the broadcaster will not emerge from it as good as it used to be but better.

Meanwhile, Natalija Gorščak, who was unlawfully dismissed as director of TV Slovenija by the previous government, expressed the hope that the fight for RTV Slovenija had helped journalists in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and elsewhere where public TV remains in the hands of autocratic regimes.",politics,politics
Court excludes part of evidence in Balkan Warrior case,"The proposal for the recusal will be decided on by Ljubljana District Court president Marjan Pogačnik.

It is not yet known how much of the evidence the court has excluded and to what extent the excluded evidence was incriminating for the accused.

It is known, however, that the panel of judges headed by judge Marjeta Dvornik has agreed to the defence's request to exclude from the court file part of the evidence that the Slovenian judicial authorities had obtained in Serbia.

This includes part of text messages between the defendant Dragan Bjelkaš and Željko Vujanović, an assistant to Serbian drug lord Darko Šarić.

As these messages were obtained in Serbia by means of covert investigative measures, the Serbian Supreme Court ruled last year that they were obtained illegally.

The panel of judges at the Ljubljana District Court has also excluded part of the evidence obtained in Slovenia and Italy, with judge Dvornik noting that an appeal against the court's decision was not possible.

Prosecutor Blanka Žgajnar noted that the Slovenian Supreme Court had annulled in November 2021 a final decision in the Balkan Warrior case as it had relied on the evidence that in the court's opinion had been obtained illegally.

Now the evidence will have to be replaced with other evidence, Žgajnar said, while prosecutor Mateja Gončin noted that an extensive part of the evidence from Slovenia, Italy and Serbia had remained in the court file.

Janez Koščak, the lawyer of the chief defendant Dragan Tošić, told the press that not enough evidence had been excluded and that ""the evidence that has remained in the court file are fruit of the poisonous tree.""

The defence now demands that the panel of judges be recused as it has been acquainted with the excluded evidence during the proceedings, which could affect its thought process and, consequently, its presumed impartiality in the Balkan Warrior case.

The prosecution believes that the request is not economical or necessary, with Žgajnar expressing her expectation that the court president will decide on the request shortly.

The case has been dragging on since the suspects' arrest in May 2010 in a police sting mounted in cooperation with Serbian police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

The group is said to have been involved in large-scale cocaine trafficking, which included organising transport from South America, especially Uruguay, and smuggling to Slovenia and Italy.

The now annulled verdict was handed down in July 2019, when the Higher Court deliberated on appeals filed by attorneys of what were 13 defendants found guilty after a retrial in March 2018, and found 11 guilty again, but only of drug trafficking, not of racketeering as well. It also reduced the sentences of some of the defendants, including Tošić, from 16 and a half years.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Wolt refuses to enter talks on collective bargaining agreement (adds),"The Trade Union of Food Delivery Couriers, formed last month to protect the rights and interests of food delivery couriers in Slovenia amid poor working conditions, called for negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement on 26 April.

The deadline for a reply expired yesterday. The union said that if the managements of the two delivery companies in Slovenia, Wolt and Glovo, are not willing to talk to the union, it would be forced to step up union activity.

Wolt sent its reply on time, saying that there was no legal basis for entering collective bargaining under the current model of cooperation with delivery partners, who are self-employed.

Wolt noted it had last met the youth trade union Mladi Plus, under whose auspices the delivery curies' union was formed, in March. ""We made it clear at the time that we support the work of the European Commission at local and European levels in providing guidance to member states on paving the way for collective representation for the self-employed.

""We agree that it is good that the self-employed also have the opportunity to represent their interests,"" Wolt wrote.

It added that the satisfaction of couriers is extremely important, which is why the company will continue the dialogue with all stakeholders, including Mladi Plus.

Mladi Plus has been warning of poor working conditions at both Wolt and Glovo for a while, and has decided to set up the new trade union in April after the situation further deteriorated.

Wolt meanwhile claims that it constantly monitors the feed-back from couriers and works to improve the working conditions.

In a press release on Wednesday the trade union wrote that they received replies from both Wolt and Glovo, stating that they do not wish to begin negotiations.

""They even lie and deceive in their replies, pretending there is no legal ground for couriers unionising and starting negotiations,"" wrote the trade union that is scandalised and offended by the responses.

It responded by denying these claims, saying that unionising is a basic human right and that collective bargaining agreements are one of the main tasks of trade unions.

The trade union sees the responses from Wolt and Glovo as a clear attack on unionising and will fight against it with all available resources.

The union has notified the European Trade Union Confederation and other institutions but has not yet released information on how it will step up union activities.",labour,labour
Slovenia endorses UN Gaza crisis resolution despite reservations,"The initial proposal of the resolution, put forward by Jordan, was unacceptable to a large share of General Assembly members because it did not condemn terrorism.

Allegedly, Slovenia was not willing to endorse the document as it was on Thursday and diplomatic sources have said it would have likely abstained, like other EU countries.

It was then agreed in negotiations that all types of violent acts against Palestinian and Israeli civilians be condemned, including terrorist act and provocations, incitement and destruction.

After the wording was tweaked, some of the larger EU countries endorsed it, including France and Spain, while Germany and Italy abstained.

Austria, Croatia, Czechia and Hungary voted against and the resolution was strongly criticised by the US and Israel for not mentioning Hamas.

Alongside Slovenia, the resolution was also endorsed by Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and Ireland. The EU countries have provided a joint explanation that they support the document because it listed much needed measures for the protection of civilian lives and increase in humanitarian aid.

However, they underlined that the document did not fully reflect their positions and explicitly condemned terrorist acts by Hamas in Israel since 7 October. They also condemned taking hostages and urged their immediate and unconditional release.

The group also explicitly noted Israel's right to self defence in line with international law, and the importance of the political process in the direction of a two-state solution. They also expressed regret that the Security Council had not been able to adopt a position on the situation in the Middle East.

The Slovenian government quoted the prime minister in a tweet, saying that a strong and clear message for the protection of civilians had been sent with the support for the resolution from the vast majority of UN member states, including Slovenia.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Slovenian physicist who was NASA's leading scientist dies,"Petrač was a world-renowned physicist and the first Slovenian candidate for a flight into space. Since 1973 he was directly involved in experiments in the zero-gravity laboratory, and in experiments with rockets, space taxis and artificial satellites.

He was an internationally renowned expert in space technology, author of many scientific publications and active participant in numerous scientific symposia. He was a consultant to Stanford University, Freie Universität Berlin, the University of Tsukuba in Japan and the US company Lockheed Martin.

His most challenging tasks included the development and construction of the first infrared astronomical satellite (IRAS), which enabled ground-breaking discoveries. Petrač contributed a solution for controlling the infrared focal plane with 64 detectors in four infrared wavebands. He introduced a method to measure the mass of superfluid helium in zero gravity.

He was born on 28 January 1932 in Kropa as the sixth child of a working-class family. He studied physics and mathematics at the University of Ljubljana. After graduating in physics in 1956, he worked as a teacher at the Kranj high school from 1957 to 1963.

A chance encounter with David Saxon, who later became the president of the University of California, during a visit to the former Nazi concentration camp Dachau, opened the door for him to do his postgraduate studies in Los Angeles, where he received his PhD in physics in 1971. His thesis dealt with phenomena in superfluid helium.

He joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and in 1977 became a senior science advisor at NASA. He worked at the laboratory until his retirement in 2012. He was awarded the title of solar system ambassador by NASA.

He won the Kurt Mendelssohn Medal for his contribution to the introduction of cryogenics into space, and also received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. In Slovenia, he was made an honorary senator of the University of Maribor, an honorary member of the Slovenian Academy of Engineering and an honorary citizen of Kranj. He was also an honorary citizen of Los Angeles.

He always stressed that Slovenia remained his homeland. He went to the US with his wife Irena, but he often returned to the country to find that his homeland did not forget him. He worked extensively with the Slovenian Science Foundation and the VTIS association of Slovenians educated abroad.",science and technology,science and technology
Importance of upbringing noted at debate on gender equality,"Speaking at the debate hosted by the Office of the European Parliament, parliamentary Speaker Urška Klakočar Zupančič said that ""if the attitude towards women is an indicator of how developed a country is, then Slovenia is very underdeveloped"".

Klakočar Zupančič, formerly a judge, said that before entering politics, she had not perceived such a level of chauvinism and sexism, and that she had been surprised by the ""wave of misogyny that is still present in our society"".

She argued that women who dared to assume professional positions that had been traditionally perceived as male were breaking the glass ceiling, adding that this was the only way to achieve equality in practice.

MEP Ljudmila Novak (EPP/NSi) said she had encountered disparaging attitudes in the political arena because of her gender when she had ran for mayor. When the critics ran out of arguments as to why she was not a good mayor, they turned to the fact that she is a woman.

Novak added that ""society which does not utilise women's potential is impoverished. It's like someone using only half of their brain or only one ear or eye.""

Former swimmer and psychologist Sara Isaković and Rosana Kolar, holder of the Slovenian Woman Engineer of the Year title, have meanwhile had more pleasant experience in their fields, with Isaković saying that she had not felt inequality in her sport.

""I'm happy that I was in an environment where there is enough room for everybody to succeed. A female swimmer and a male swimmer are brought up in the same way. If you work hard, are motivated, if your head is in the right place, you can reach to the top,"" Isaković said.

Kolar, an aircraft mechanic, never heard anyone saying she was not capable of doing something because she was a women. She actually heard negative responses from women, ""who wondered whether I felt less feminine or whether I have maternal instincts"".

Foreign Ministry State Secretary Samuel Žbogar said that ""Slovenia has a much bigger problem with gender equality than it admits. Not only in politics but also in civil society"".

He noted certain negative responses to Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon announcing that Slovenia would lead a ""feminist foreign policy"".

Žbogar explained that meant that Slovenia advocated gender equality in foreign policy, as well as at the Foreign Ministry itself.

As one of the steps that could improve the situation, he noted the importance of upbringing and parents serving as an example, which Isaković agreed with.

""I come from a family that instilled confidence in me and gave me a sense of self-worth so that I could achieve whatever I wanted,"" said the silver Olympic medallist, noting that women too needed to start appreciating themselves.

The debate also featured Shiva Nazar Ahari, an Iranian journalist and author who has lived in Slovenia since 2018. She was imprisoned twice in Iran and she believes she would be in prison there today, had she stayed in her homeland.

She said that Iranian women had been systematically discriminated against for 40 years, which also depended on their families. ""If she comes from a poor environment, she will be married off before she even grows up.""

Steklarna Hrastnik helping explore use of hydrogen to decarbonise glass manufacturing,"What is the biggest European project focusing on the use of hydrogen in the glass industry features various segments of the sector, including packaging glass, flat glass and fibreglass manufacturers. The project is coordinated by Sintef Energy, a Norwegian company, involves partners from eight European countries and will run for four years, Steklarna Hrastnik said.

Also assisting in the endeavour, which has a budget of EUR 33 million, will be a group of industrial and research institutions, among them the Slovenian Institute of Chemistry.

Steklarna Hrastnik aims to demonstrate the use of 100% hydrogen in two of its units by 2024. This will allow to combine the use of hydrogen with the use of electrically-assisted glass melting and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions without significantly affecting production flexibility and the service life of the glass furnace.

The combination of these technologies will be key to decarbonising glass production, added Steklarna Hrastnik, while also noting that the glass industry, like other energy-intensive industries, is an indispensable part of the economy, providing raw materials and products for other value chains that are important for the EU economy.

Gen projects potential second unit of Krško N-plant could be built by 2035,"Levičar of Gen Energija, which runs the Slovenian half of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant (NEK), said that given the plan to phase out coal by 2033, Slovenia will face roughly 60% dependence on electricity imports in 2035 if no new production capacities are secured.

This shortfall can be partly made up by increased investment in wind and solar power, but by no means to the extent that this alone would guarantee a reliable supply. However, NEK 2 would bring us closer to the necessary levels of energy independence, Levičar said as part of a press event looking at Gen's performance in the past year.

The state-owned power utility, which also hopes to have the life span of NEK, Slovenia's sole nuclear plant, extended by another 20 years to 2043, feels that a second reactor and increased hydro and solar generation could decarbonise Slovenia's electricity production by 2035.

While there is no final decision yet on whether to build NEK 2 - the government is also announcing a referendum on the issue - Gen Energija is striving to manage the process so that things will be ready to go ahead once the decision is known.

""NEK 2 is an intergenerational project. If the visionary decision for NEK, for this non-carbon resource which allows us energy independence and climate neutrality today, was made in the past to enable a new generation to enjoy its fruits, I believe that our decision for NEK 2 will similarly ensure that our generation and the generations to come will also have energy independence,"" Levičar said.

The aim is for NEK 2 to be operational in 2035, ""but on the condition that operations and construction from today onwards are uninterrupted"", Levičar said.

Gen's management feels procedures have been too slow. The motion for a national spatial plan was filed in December 2021 and a response came in September 2022 so that the projected completion of the project had to be postponed from 2033 to 2035.

While the motion for a spatial plan is presently being supplemented, the next milestone will be a contract with the supplier, which is planned to happen by the end of 2027.

The preparation of the large components should take about three years, which would be followed by a final construction permit. Then, as practice shows, construction could take around five years, with tested technology allegedly already selected, so that trial mode could start in 2035.

Gen is also exploring the possibility of using small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), with Levičar noting that the technology is still in development and not yet commercially available.",environmental issue,environmental issue
Slovenian PEN warns against Israeli offensive on Gaza Strip,"The organisation says in the letter that ""such irresponsible statements"" are unbecoming of a country that will soon be a member of the UN Security Council.

The Slovenian PEN is afraid that the ""killing of innocent civilians in the terrorist attack by Hamas will continue and escalate if Israel carries out its threat of a punitive march on the Gaza Strip.""

It noted that two million Palestinians, the vast majority of whom are innocent civilians, were crammed and, perhaps hopelessly trapped, in this small territory.

The Slovenian PEN disagrees with the public statement of the Movement for the Liberation of Palestine, co-signed by 42 Slovenian organisations, in which not a single word mentions the ""criminal nature of Hamas's attack"" on Israel.

""Now is the high time for peace to be re-established,"" urges the letter signed by International PEN vice-president Boris A. Novak, the executive committee of the Slovenian PEN and its president Tanja Tuma.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Delo comments on Blinken's visit to Israel and Palestine,"At the meeting with representatives of the most extreme rightist and racist government in Israel's 75-year history, after a week of bloody events and tensions, which are the consequences of Israel's systematic policy of apartheid, he spoke about a two-state solution, a notion devoid of content, which has been an extremely shallow foreign policy joke for years, the paper says.

As if mocking the cruel facts and complete erasure of Palestine and the Palestinians from geopolitical maps he concluded his visit by stating something that could hardly be further from the truth. He said that the US was committed to ""our enduring goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, justice, and dignity"".

When stating this he forgot that under Donald Trump Washington moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising it as the capital of Israel, to which it allowed the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.

However, Blinken did not forget to add that the US support for Israel remains solid. It is measured in the amount of annual military aid provided to the country: in 2022 it stood at US$3.8 billion.

The arrival of Israel's old ally Joe Biden into the White House has not changed the policies that allowed the Israeli authorities to ""realise their wet dreams without any control or punishment"". And these did not change even during a short absence of Benjamin Netanyahu from the office of the prime minister.

The pathetic Israeli opposition, which in its core is leaning to the right, dealt with its own survival during that time and failed. Despite a court procedure in which he faces heavy corruption charges, Netanyahu came back in style and became prime minister for the sixth time.

This time he formed the government of extreme rightist and religious parties and offered ministerial posts to people who personify racism and incite clashes. It the last week alone, these clashes have led to the deaths of ten Palestinian and seven Israelis.

Blinken overlooked all that. Also because for the first time in history the US is more dependant on Israel than vice versa. The US wants to revive Iran's nuclear agreement and Israel strongly opposes this, so now Washington cannot afford stepping on Netanyahu's fingers, as he has forged strong ties with Sunni Arab countries, creating a kind of anti-Iran coalition.

Israel has not sided with anyone in the Ukrainian war for complex reasons related exclusively to national interest. The US does not want it to move even closer to Moscow. But the key reason is that the period when human rights were respected is irreversibly over, Delo says.",politics,politics
Slovenia sees trade surplus as exports increase 28% y/y in February (adds),"Slovenia had been reporting deficits for the past two years, caused by higher energy prices and drops in exports, as well as supply chain problems and a slow period for the automotive industry.

The largest increase was seen in exports to non-EU countries, which was up 61.9% over February 2022, exceeding EUR 1.87 billion. Exports to EU members also increased, reaching 2.7 billion, up 11.9% compared to February 2022.

Imports remained nearly level, gaining 1.4% over February 2022 to reach EUR 4.25 billion. Similar to exports, here too growth was most pronounced in imports from non-EU members. It exceeded EUR 1.55 billion, up 2.4% year-on-year. Imports from EU countries were up 0.8% year-on-year to reach EUR 2.7 billion.

Compared to last year's average, exports were up by 3.5% and imports dropped by 10.2% in February, the Statistics Office said.

Data for the first two months of the year show that exports increased by 28.9% over the year before and imports were up 14%. The biggest increase in trade value was seen in trade with non-EU countries, which was up by 72.7%.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Govt caps district heating gas prices for protected users,"According to Environment, Climate and Energy Minister Bojan Kumer, the maximum price for protected users has been set at 79 euro per Megawatt hour.

The maximum gas retail price for households and for production of heat for households stands at 73 euro per MWh in line with the government's decree.

Asked how come the prices are not regulated for certain users, the minister said that all users had not been in the same situation when the crisis started. Some had been buying energy for years in advance, he said.

The government has been addressing the energy price hikes since the second half of last year and as many users as possible are being shielded, he said.

The prices have been capped for households, vulnerable and protected users, while companies receive aid. ""Those who cannot buy electricity at regulated prices and are not included in this decree can receive aid in line with the act determining the aid to the economy due to high electricity and natural gas prices.""

The ministry is also preparing grounds for reimbursing gas, heat and electricity suppliers for the difference between the capped price at which they have to sell and the price at which they buy. Changes to this regulation should be ready within a week or two, Kumer said.

The financial implications of these measures will depend mainly on temperatures this year. ""If the year turns out to be warm and the first half of January suggests this, the financial impact will be lower. But if temperatures will be low, our estimates will be confirmed, because we have taken into account the worst-case scenario,"" he said.",environmental issue,environmental issue
Govt adopts action plan to combat human trafficking,"Systematic and long-term awareness-raising among children and teenagers will continue, the Interior Ministry said, noting that minors were an especially vulnerable group when it came to human trafficking.

Based on a multi-year plan, workshops will be held in the ninth grade of primary schools and the second year of secondary schools in all Slovenian regions, including in areas where members of the Roma community live.

The government office in charge of ethnic communities and minorities plans to include anti-trafficking content into its everyday work, in particular to address forced and early marriages in the Roma community.

To mark the EU Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October, an event will take place to raise awareness about human trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation. The prerequisite for human trafficking is the demand for goods and services provided by exploited workers or the victims of such crimes, and so prevention activities will aim to reduce this demand by spotlighting the responsibility of the users.

Moreover, a stronger link needs to be established with the private sector, which is directly or indirectly involved in most cases of forced labour.

The action plan also provides for training of many professionals, including police officers, labour inspectors, state prosecutors and judges, tax authority staff and employees of social work centres and asylum seekers centres.

The strategy includes six chapters: prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of the crime of human trafficking, identification and protection of and assistance to victims, international cooperation, improvement of systemic solutions and proposals for legislative changes, and coordination and support activities, the ministry added.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Social dialogue expected to be resumed as ESS members meet,"Representatives of employers, employees and the government in the country's main industrial relations forum seem to have ironed out the disagreements after employers decided to boycott its sessions due to the absence of the prime minister.

Jakob Počivavšek, the head of the Pergam trade union confederation and the current chair of the ESS, said that the three sides had agreed after a lengthy debate today that social dialogue was exceptionally important.

""Individual legislative solutions were also discussed"", Počivavšek said, adding that reform plans and their timeline would be reviewed on Friday, when the ESS has a discussion on the implementation of the recovery and resilience plan on the agenda.

Draft laws which demand greater involvement of social partners and which could be harmonised as late as in the parliamentary procedure will be identified, he said, adding that ""we want legitimate decisions and appropriately implemented reforms.""

Marjan Trobiš, the head of the Employer Association of Slovenia, said that employers had expected from Prime Minister Robert Golob to be somewhat more critical of the member of his cabinet.

Although Trobiš doubts that social dialogue will not be violated in the future, as employers have had the feeling that it was a ""social monologue of two sides"", he said employers would persist and see whether it would become a ""constructive dialogue"".

""The current legislative proposals are tailored to trade unions and the state,"" Trobiš said, adding that, although employers had calmed down somewhat, they were not entirely sure they will be able to conduct social dialogue in the way they should.

Golob, who attended today's session, said that social dialogue was a ""living thing"" and that time restraints were sometimes objective circumstances that could not be changed.

""We have committed ourselves to implementing examples of good practice in all areas,"" he said, adding that he believed that ""work in the next 12 months will be effective and that solutions that are good for people will be found.""",politics,politics
Clearing of river beds the biggest problem in Savinja Valley,"Ljubno ob Savinji Mayor Franjo Naraločnik told the STA on Wednesday that the municipality mainly needs excavators, lorries and other heavy machinery to restore links to areas that are still inaccessible and to clear up the beds of watercourses.

It is becoming clearer and clearer that the municipality will have to solve the issues itself, which will prolong the flood recovery. Reconstruction will not take five or ten years, but even longer, he added.

The local water supply is running smoothly, and on its own, the municipality got rid of the waste which had piled up after the floods, Naraločnik said.

What raises concerns is that the area is still shrouded in ""clouds of dust"", and the people would like to know how harmful it is.

There are cases of severe mental health issues in the wake of the floods with psychologists doing their best to calm people down in the face of looming rain.

In the Gornji Grad municipality, efforts to clear up the beds of watercourses before the next rain are also a priority. Heavy machinery has been provided by a subcontractor, Mayor Anton Špeh told the STA.

In another municipality in the region, Nazarje, the local authorities are attempting to clear watercourses on their own, including on the confluence of the Savinja and the Dreta, Mayor Matej Pečovnik said.

Meanwhile, the biggest problem in Mozirje is the local waste water treatment plant, which was damaged in the early August floods.

Since there is a waiting period for the needed spare parts, untreated sewage is currently being discharged into the Savinja, the STA learnt from Mayor Ivan Suhoveršnik.

The municipality of Luče, another area ravaged by the floods, is busy repairing the road leading to Ljubno, an effort that is not really in its domain since it involves a state road. The plan is to restore this road connection within a month.

The area faces difficulties in supplying shops with products, as most of the roads to Luče are still impassable, Mayor Klavdij Strmčnik told the STA.

The municipality is therefore considering pushing back the beginning of the new school year.

The Education Ministry told the STA recently it was drafting a proposal to allow a postponement of five school days in areas worst hit by the floods.

Most of the 19 primary schools that were damaged will nevertheless be able to welcome students on 1 September, but impassable roads may pose an additional problem for a few.",labour,environmental issue
Japan welcomes initiative to join forces in hydrogen technologies,"Minister Igor Papič attended the Science and Technology in Society forum, and on the sidelines of the event he held several bilateral meetings, of which the most important one was dedicated to Slovenian-Japanese cooperation in the development of hydrogen technologies, the ministry said.

Following successful cooperation between Slovenia and the NEDO on a project for the development of smart grids, Slovenia would now like to join forces in hydrogen technologies.

The minister discussed cooperation between Slovenia and the EU and Japan with several officials, including the EU's Ambassador to Japan Jean-Eric Paquet, who proposed to continue the talks with more concrete steps.

Also supporting Slovenia's initiative are Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yasutoshi Nishimura and NEDO president Tamotsu Saito.

The two agreed that, as potential partners, they should start working on proposals for cooperation as soon as possible, the ministry said.

""The endorsement of our idea in the field of hydrogen technologies demonstrates the highest level of support and trust shown by Japan towards Slovenia, which has proved to be a reliable and high quality partner based on years-long cooperation and, in particular, the latest joint project,"" Papič said.

To illustrate the importance of this step, he added that successful European countries had been trying to launch a similar project with Japan for years, but had so far been unsuccessful due to high Japanese standards.

Papič also met Nagahiro Minato, president of Kyoto University, to discuss the expansion of cooperation between Japanese and Slovenian universities.

Moreover, the minister and Takanori Ueda, president of the University of Fukui, discussed good cooperation with the University of Ljubljana in the field of robotics and opportunities for joint research in artificial intelligence and information technologies.

He also held talks with the President of the European Research Council (ERC) Maria Leptin to discuss cooperation in the preparation of the new framework programme for research and development in the coming months. Leptin, who visited Slovenia in June, reiterated Slovenia's progress in ERC open calls as an example for other countries, the ministry said.

At the Science and Technology in Society forum, Papič took part in panel discussions on open science, circulation of knowledge and trust in science. He stressed the need for reform of existing research evaluation systems and noted Slovenia's efforts to step up science popularisation.",science and technology,science and technology
Minister announces forum on violence as he visits care home (adds),"""This case must serve as a reminder that we as a state do too little to prevent violence and that new strategies are needed to address it"", the minister said.

He added that ""violence is unacceptable. As a society, we must have zero tolerance to it, and we must all work together to ensure it does not occur or happen again.""

While working during her summer holidays, a secondary school student assaulted an elderly woman at the Trebnje care home last month, pulling the woman's hair and pinching her nose.

The student recorded the abuse of the woman herself and posted it on social media. The care home was alerted to the abuse in anonymous e-mails, which the care home forwarded to the police.

Maljevac said the care home's director Petra Kušar Stojakovič reacted adequately to protect the victim and report the abuser to the police.

He also believes that the ministry must approach violence actively rather than just reacting when excessive incidents occur.

A forum of experts from the field will thus be held on Monday to ""devise measures that we as a society must take to address violence against the elderly and in general"", said Maljevac.

Kušar Stojakovič deeply regretted the incident and expressed her sympathies with the victims, but could not provide details as the police investigation is ongoing.

She only confirmed the violence was perpetrated by a female secondary school student under the age of 18 who worked to earn some money during her summer school break.

The director said they had acted based on anonymous e-mails about the abuse, ""which indicated at extortion"", and immediately turned to the police.

The care home also opened an internal review, which is still under way, and informed all bodies that must be informed in such cases.

All the other residents apart from the victim will also receive all the needed help and psychosocial support, as will their relatives and the staff.

""We are committed to sanctioning any harmful misconduct at the care home. No harmful behaviour is tolerated at our care home,"" the director said.

She explained that all temps from secondary schools or university are first briefed on the nature of the work, then they get a mentor to supervise them.

In hiring student workers over the holidays, the care home works closely with schools, added Kušar Stojakovič.

Human Rights Ombudsman Peter Svetina is appalled and concerned by the videos of violence against the elderly at the Trebnje home. He reiterated the call for zero tolerance towards violence and announced a meeting with the relevant institutions to discuss the issue.

The Human Rights Ombudsman has recently received several different petitions about allegations of violence in care homes and the office turned to the care homes mentioned for explanations.

""We are requesting clarifications from them, and we have also contacted other competent institutions, with whom we will meet shortly on this issue, as we want to work together to prevent all forms of violence against the elderly,"" Svetina said in a press release.

He said violence against the elderly was particularly worrying, as it often takes place behind four walls, within families or institutions and it concerns ""one of the most vulnerable groups of our society"".

He called for more preventive measures, especially among the young, and for raising awareness about what is mistreatment, as victims are often unaware of the fact that they are being subject to violence.

The Pensioners' Association (ZDUS) expressed concern over the actions of the high school student and noted that stereotypes about the elderly as being helpless and confused should be overcome to enable them a decent and equal treatment in society.

""We reiterate the need for the competent institutions to invest in the training and education of all professional groups that work with the elderly,"" said ZDUS president Zdenka Jan. She called for a respectful and sensitive attitude towards the elderly.

Ten suffer carbon monoxide poisoning during flood relief effort,"Robert Carotta, the chief physician of the SAF, said in a press statement yesterday that the clean-up work in the cellar had taken place in the afternoon and had been headed by a fire brigade.

A total of 32 people were exposed to carbon monoxide in the cellar - 18 members of the Army of North Macedonia, eight firefighters and six members of the SAF.

All of them were examined and treated on the spot by Carotta, who assessed that their lives were not at risk.

Five members of the SAF, two members of the Army of North Macedonia and one firefighter were then sent to the nearest hospital for further treatment and observation.

In the evening, the condition of another two exposed firefighters deteriorated, and they were also taken by ambulance to the Slovenj Gradec general hospital, Carotta said.

Giant ancient dugout found in Mura after massive floods,"This assumption is made based on the characteristics of the stern and the dugout's size, which correspond to those of the vessels used in Central and Western Europe in the late Bronze Age and Iron Age, when the transport needs increased due to demographic and economic rise in the early first millennium BC.

The dugout was found in mid-September by Ljubomir Zečević, a connoisseur of the natural and cultural heritage of the Prekmurje region. He immediately informed director of the regional museum, archaeologist Branko Kerman, of the find, archaeology institute Skupina Stik said.

The dugout probably surfaced during the massive floods that hit the country in August and has been labelled a spectacular find.

Zečevič, Kerman and a conservator from the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage, visited the site to determine that that the canoe was dug out of an oak tree with a hand tool.

The find is said to be spectacular because of the length of the vessel - which is more than 11 metres - and an interesting and rare type of stern, ending in a massive vertical plank inserted into a groove.

The experts say that the original location of the vessel is difficult to determine, but it is almost certain that the floods could not have ripped it out of the nearby plains but that the dugout had probably rested in the sediments of the Mura riverbed upstream from the spot where it was found.

Based on the studies of dugouts of comparable size it could be concluded that this one could carry between nine and 14 persons or a corresponding amount of cargo and a two- to three-member crew.

The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage has ordered the dugout to be transferred to a safe location. Several history and archaeology institutes, including the Archaeology Department of the Faculty of Arts from Ljubljana, will join forces to pull out the vessel this weekend.

The dugout will be secured and fastened to a support platform, on which it will be moved downstream along the Mura to a spot from where it can be lifted. It will then be transported to the Murska Sobota Lake, where it will be stored at the bottom of the lake pending a decision on further conservation procedures, Skupina Stik said.",sport,disaster and accident
RTV Slovenija director general called on to resign,"In the ruling announced on Wednesday, the court said that the appointment was unlawful because Grah Whatmough had lacked three years of experience to run large business organisations. His appointment was challenged by his predecessor Igor Kadunc.

The appellate court said that the lower court did not apply substantive law correctly when it ruled in July 2022 that as director of two one-man companies and as the chair of the RTV supervisory board, he had gained experience in organising and managing large business organisations.

The RTV Slovenija works council, the association of in-house trade unions, and the Trade Union of Journalists said on Friday as they commented on the court decision that it ""confirms their warnings"".

""The ruling upholds the voices of critical employees and critical public that, in a time of serious financial, organisational and management crisis, the highest post at RTV is being held by a person who has no experience in managing such a system.""

They added that the ruling must also be read in light of the move from March 2022, when Grah Whatmough presented the RTV Slovenija programme council with an initiative for his own resignation and for publishing a new call for applications to which he would apply although he still had a valid mandate.

However, the job requirements were changed so that a minimum of three years of experience in running a large business organisation was no longer a requirement, with the organisations noting at the time that this ran against the legislative and statutory provisions.

In their opinion, the verdict of the Higher Labour Court confirms that legislation is being systematically circumvented and that the RTV Slovenija management is undermining the professional standards and encroaching on journalist and editorial autonomy.

They believe that the current management ""resorts to unlawful and ethically objectionable moves in order to remain in power and continue the disputable transformation of public broadcaster"". They thus called on Grah Whatmough to resign, otherwise the programme council should dismiss him.",labour,labour
Golob: Govt decision in principle on second nuclear reactor by 1 August (adds),"Speaking at the discussion on the future of nuclear energy in Slovenia, Golob said the ""journey is long but we are going to take it"", but added that it was not necessarily irreversible.

According to the prime minister, concrete legislative steps will be needed. He hinted at the possibility of drafting a special bill on the second reactor and it siting. ""If we follow the current legislation, Krško 2 will be built in 2047. /.../ Unless we radically change our approach, we will not live to see it.""

Golob also mentioned the possibility of several bills dealing with the project, assessing that each would be put to a referendum.

Teams will have to be set up to deal with the project, he said, announcing that Danijel Levičar, business director at energy company Gen Energija, would coordinate the project at the prime minister's office.

Even when it stops using coal for energy, Slovenia will need to have diverse sources like it has had so far, so apart from the nuclear energy the government will also develop hydro-energy and other renewables, he said.

""None of the sources are in competition with each other. We need all of them,"" he said, noting that electricity needs in the future would be much higher than today.

Minister of the Environment, Climate and Energy Bojan Kumer and Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Minister Uroš Brežan also took part in the debate with Kumer announcing an upgrade to the national energy and climate plan, which will set a clear long-term plan for the use of nuclear energy, which will not be restricted only to Krško 2, but will allow for a wider use of nuclear energy.

Brežan said that the strategy on spatial development by 2050 will also speak of continued use of nuclear energy with the possibility of a second nuclear facility without specifying either the technology or location.

Gen Energija CEO Dejan Paravan said the company had realised that focussing on a single 1100 megawatt reactor, as is the plan for now, was not the best, as the global circumstances have changed. The interest of investors has also increased, both from Slovenia and other countries.

In line with this, the spatial plans will envisage an up to 1600 megawatt facility.

After the summer holidays, Gen Energija will start a public discussion with stakeholders, but it is clear that the company cannot finance the project on its own and is open to co-investment. A comprehensive study on the financial structure and business models related to the reactor power will be completed by the end of 2024.

Commenting on initiatives for participating in the financing, Golob said that everyone who wanted to have long-term access to energy on equal terms should have the opportunity to take part. ""The government will support mixed investor models, not least because it spreads the risks,"" he said. If there is more interest and it will be more economical to build a larger unit, he believes that no one will object to taking full advantage of the opportunity.

Stane Rožman, the former long-term head of the Krško Nuclear Plant (NEK), called for a clear formal political decision that Krško 2 should be built. The coordination of the project should also be clearly set. Siting procedures should start this year, including the environmental impact assessment and a special team should be set up at Gen Energija dealing only with this project, he said.

""We are at a point where we have to say yes or no to Krško 2. If we say yes, there is no going back, there is only action and hard work,"" he said. He also said that NEK's performance so far was certainly an excellent stepping stone for Slovenia to continue using nuclear energy also beyond 2043, when its lifespan expires under the current plans.

Krško Mayor Janez Kerin expects the municipality to be an active partner in all Krško 2 proceedings, as it has plenty of expertise and experience after decades of living with NEK. He assessed the cooperation with Gen Energija so far as excellent. Krško is in favour of a new nuclear power plant and is aware of the positive and negative effects of Krško 2, as well as the fact the project is a long-term commitment, he said.

Slovenia has only one nuclear power station, the Krško Nuclear Plant (NEK), which it co-owns with Croatia. The plant was built with Western technology and launched in the early 1980s. Its lifespan has in recent years been expanded until 2043.",environmental issue,environmental issue

Analyst: Đukanović's defeat creates political vacuum in Montenegro,"Đukanović leaving office marks the start of the end of his more than his 30-year political career and probably indicates that his Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) will lose in the June early general election, he said.

According to him, ""a large part of the political elite is trying to project the idea to the much divided Montenegrin society that frictions will decrease only when Đukanović leaves the political arena"".

However, Kočan believes Đukanović's defeat creates a political vacuum in which two dominating ideas of Montenegro will clas - a pro-Serbian and a liberal pro-European one.

The pro-Serbian movement strives for better regional cooperation and a strong role of the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the liberal pro-European current would like Montenegro to be part of Euro-Atlantic integration and implement a model of ethnic heterogeneity.

Kočan believes these two ideas will clash in the coming months and years and the outcome will show what Đukanović's defeat means for Montenegro and the region.

Jakov Milatović and his ""Europe Now!"" Movement has presented itself as a kind of alternative to Đukanović and the pro-Serbian Democratic Front, but it is not clear yet whether this was just a good political move or Milatović is serious about his plans, the analyst said.

According to him, Đukanović's defeat is an opportunity to redefine Montenegro's relations with Serbia and the role of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the Montenegrin society.

""In a sense, the defeat of Đukanović is most likely also a defeat of the idea of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church and its potential autocephaly. It also opens the door wide to better relations between Montenegro and Serbia and to the preservation of the role of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegrin society as one of the central pillars ensuring the cohesiveness of Montenegrin society"", he said.

Đukanović's political career started crumbling in 2019 and 2020, when protests were held against corruption in the country and against the law on religious freedom, with which Đukanović tried to reduce the influence of the Serbian Orthodox Church while consolidating the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, Kočan said.

""In doing so, he opened a Pandora's box that has brought Montenegrin society, which has been increasingly dissatisfied with Đukanović over the Serbian Orthodox Church as well as corruption and cronyism, to the point where it has got a sense of his vulnerability,"" he said.

As soon as the second round of election was announced, it was clear that Đukanović would lose the presidential race, because the voters voted against Đukanović and not for Milatović, Kočan, a researcher at the Centre for International Relations at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana, told the STA.",politics,politics

Essential services being restored in worst affected parts of Koroška (adds),"An emergency headquarters set up in the town after a makeshift gravel road was established for vital supplies in Sunday said that electricity had since been restored to parts of the municipality, which has a population of some 3,300. Healthcare has also been re-established.

A hundred members of the Slovenian Armed Forces, hundred firefighters and many volunteers have headed to the town to help in the clean-up and flood relief effort, the emergency headquarters announced on Monday.

The headquarters comprises representatives of civil protection, medical staff, mountain rescuers, firefighters and other staff.

They said utility teams had restored power through the entire town of Črna, while some hamlets remain cut off.

Efforts are under way in Črna to repair the riverbeds of the Meža and one of the tributaries, which were flooding Črna and the surrounding areas for more than two days. Building machinery teams are also removing debris from roads.

A medical unit at the Črna Community Health Centre is open round the clock. Slovenia has meanwhile asked Austria for assistance in providing medical services to people who have been cut off from the rest of Slovenia and were evacuated via Austria.

Work is under way to restore road links and water supply throughout the Koroška region. Many companies in the region remain closed and many roads are unpassable, as dozens of landslides loom.

In Prevalje the main concern is to restore water supply as the water pipes are broken in several parts. Mayor Matic Tasič told the STA they had asked the army to provide two pontoon bridges to which a pipeline could be attached.

They will also try to get portable toilets, in particular for people in apartment blocks. The mayor expressed concern about the impact of the situation on public health.

In Mežica, flood waters destroyed all eight bridges, only one is passable conditionally, Mayor Mark Maze told the STA.

Defence Minister Marjan Šarec said on Sunday that the military would take over the clean-up efforts in Koroška, with the STA learning today that the headquarters are to be set up in Mežica, a town north of Črna.

Landslides are still threatening several houses, while the mayor described the damage to road and utility infrastructure and to businesses as disastrous. He hopes for a bridge to be set up to the right bank of the Meža River so that companies such as Cablex-M and Ferolin ""can salvage what can still be salvaged"".

In Dravograd more than 250 people had to be evacuated due to a looming landslide. They expect assistance with heavy machinery from Postojna today, but water supply in the municipality has been restored.

Power is being restored throughout Koroška. Elektro Celje, the utility covering the region and the broader area around Celje, said most of the homes remain without power in the upper Savinja Valley.

In the area covered by Elektro Ljubljana, most households remain without power in the area of Kamnik, north of Ljubljana, and Zidani Most, east of Ljubljana.

Even if the rain stopped late on Sunday, firefighters were deployed for the fourth night in a row in various parts of the country to help people under threat of floods or landslides, mostly in Koroška and the Pomurje region in the north-east.

Data from the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration shows that 62 fire brigades were on the ground dealing with the consequences of heavy rain, strong gusts of wind and hail and the aftermath of the massive flooding.

Flood waters persist along the rivers Mura, Drava and Sava. Hydrologist Janez Polajnar said on Sunday that the levees on the Mura needed to hold for another day to prevent a disaster.

Due to the soggy ground, landslides will remain a major risk for a while longer. Many were triggered on Sunday, in particular in Koroška and the Savinja Valley.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident

"Average wage up 11.3% in November, mostly due to bonuses","The average gross wage for November 2022 amounted to EUR 2,244.35, which is 10.9% higher on a monthly basis nominally and 9.9% in real terms.

This is mostly due to extraordinary payments to employees such as 13th month pay and Christmas bonuses, which amounted to an average of EUR 928.90 gross, up 16.6% compared to the same payment in November 2021.

The 13th salary and/or Christmas bonuses were paid out in November 2022 to 23.4% of all employed persons, the Statistics Office noted.

Compared to October, the average gross wage increased in November both in the private sector (+13.9%) and the public sector (+5.4%).

Fmr money laundering tzar investigated for abuse of office (adds),"The police and the state prosecution are investigating whether Žugelj violated the law, abused his office and the Office for Money Laundering Prevention in launching the extensive investigation, N1 says.

N1 reports on Saturday that a short anonymous letter, received by the Office for Money Laundering Prevention during the time of Slovenia's previous, Janša-led government, had triggered one of the most extensive investigations ever performed by the office.

In only three weeks, the office sent 238 demands to banks to look into 195 bank accounts, N1 says. ""I have never heard of such an extensive investigation by this office, especially based on an anonymous letter,"" the first director of the office, Klaudijo Stroligo, told N1.

Necenzurirano reported a while ago that Slovenia's then Prime Minister Janša had struck a deal with Serbian President Vučić before last year's general election.

Janša was allegedly interested in his then rival and now Prime Minister Robert Golob and the business of Gen-I, the company Golob headed a long time, in the Balkans, the portal said.

Vučić was allegedly interested in the transactions of Dragan Đilas, a Serbian opposition leader, and Dragan Šolak, the Serbian co-owner of United, the parent company of N1 and Telemach, among others.

Janša rejected for N1 the report about his alleged deal with Vučić as absurd insinuations.

Citing the charges against Žugelj and other documents, N1 says that the office had inspected the bank accounts of Šolak, his immediate and distant family, the accounts of his companies in Slovenia and the private bank accounts of all managers in these companies.

The office also looked into the bank account of Branko Čakarmiš, now the general director of media company Pro Plus, the owner of broadcasters POP TV and Kanal A, and then the broadcasters' programme director.

Čakarmiš's account was inspected because the anonymous letter mentions a company called ASPN, in which Čakarmiš was director and part owner for a while in 2006, N1 says.

Necenzurirano also says that a part of the large volume of documents amassed by the Office for Money Laundering Prevention during that investigation had gone missing.

Žugelj meanwhile told N1 that the anonymous letter was ""rather extensive and specific, and could be described as wistleblowing"".

N1 says that the Financial Administration (FURS), then led by Ivan Simič, a prominent supporter of Janša's, had joined the investigation. The two bodies sent criminal complaints to the police against more than ten companies and individuals in Slovenia and abroad. But the investigation could not confirm the suspicions raised in the complaints.

N1 says that one of the key leads investigated by Žugelj was cash flow of EUR 80 million Telemach received between 2007 and 2021. This turned out to be the proceeds of cash payments by subscribers who pay their bills at Telemach offices, where the payment is commission-free.

United group and its co-owner Šolak reacted to the report in the afternoon. ""It is unbelievable and alarming that such primitive abuse was even possible in an EU member state in 2022,"" N1 reported Šolak as saying in a written statement.

""As someone who loves Slovenia and whose immediate family members are Slovenian, I sincerely hope that the state systems will show that the rule of law exists in Slovenia and that those responsible will be appropriately sanctioned,"" said Šolak.

The United group called on the relevant institutions to investigate whether ""illegal methods unbecoming of a democracy have been used against us, and to find who is responsible"", according to N1.

The media group also expects the relevant institutions to inform it whether data about its companies and its employees had been abused, where the documents are stored and whether all data has been appropriately protected. The group also expects a clear answer as to whether the investigation entailed political abuse of institutions.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Minister talks plant protection products with French counterpart,"The bilateral meeting was held on the sidelines of an event organised by Fesneau during the international agricultural show SIA.

Šinko and Fesneau underscored good cooperation between their countries and discussed topical issues in agriculture, including the European Commission's proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products.

Slovenia's main concern is the proposed ban on the use of all plant protection products in specific, sensitive areas, the ministry said in a press release, ""as the objectives of reducing pesticide use should be achieved in a way that does not reduce agricultural production, thereby jeopardising the EU's food security and increasing dependence on food imports"".

Starting her visit to the SIA show on Monday, Šinko met representatives of French and Slovenian farmers' organisations.

Following today's meeting with Fesneau, the Slovenian minister took part in an event co-hosted by Slovenia and France to discuss agricultural land management.

Slovenia's agricultural land management model, family farm system and sustainable agriculture model were presented at the event. Šinko said that France and Slovenia were very different in size, but faced similar problems. Many young farmers face the problem of access to new arable lands, she noted, while also talking about the general situation in Slovenian agriculture.

Šinko held a number of other bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the SIA show, including with representatives of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) and the French Agricultural Technical Institute (ACTA).

The SIA fair will end on Sunday and until then Slovenia will keep showcasing its beekeeping, viticulture and winemaking, fine cuisine and tourism.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

Memorial to the erased unveiled,"The memorial is made in the shape of the upper part of the letter ć, which is often present in the last names of the people who originate from parts of the former Yugoslavia other than Slovenia.

It makes the centrepiece of the new Park of the Erased, which is located in the courtyard of the Rog Centre, a former bicycle factory turned into a new hub for creatives.

A series of speakers addressing the unveiling ceremony underscored that the memorial should serve as a reminder of one of the worst mass violations of human rights in the independent Slovenia the likes of which should never happen again.

The memorial does not solve any problem, but it is a patch on the ""bleeding wound of the erased"", said one of the victims of the erasure, Katarina Keček.

Moderating the event alongside her, Ratko Stojiljković said that as a child of the erased he had faced institutional racism since 1992, which left a strong mark on Slovenia's school and social systems until this day.

""This is a memorial meant to be used, for children to climb it, to take pictures at it, neither too big nor too small to make everyone in the park feel good,"" said Renata Zamida, director of the Rog Centre.

Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan said it was not to the credit of the state that it took ""30 years to tackle the ordeal of the erased"". She pledged to work for the injustices still suffered by the erased to be fully redressed as soon as possible.

Marking the 30th anniversary of the erasure last year the then President Borut Pahor apologised for the act on Slovenia's behalf, which is seen as a gesture ending the period of denial.

Now the memorial gives ""the collective memory its symbol and image"", Nataša Posel, director of the Slovenian chapter of Amnesty International, said.

Amnesty International is one of several NGOs which say the issue of the erased has still not been fully resolved and Posel called on the government to adopt legislation to tackle the matter.

The NGOs also argue that the damages paid to the erased cannot compensate for the loss of jobs, pensions, education opportunities, or the chance to purchase their homes under favourable conditions.

When Slovenia declared its independence in 1991, the precursor to the National Assembly passed a package of independence legislation, including a foreigners act and a citizenship act.

Under the latter, citizens of Yugoslav republics other than Slovenia who were registered as permanent residents in Slovenia had to apply for Slovenian citizenship in half a year.

Those who failed to do so were removed from the country's register of permanent residents in February 1992 and they fell under the provisions of the foreigners act.

The Constitutional Court declared the erasure unlawful in 1999 and again in 2003, ordering the National Assembly to restore the erased status of permanent residents from the day of the erasure.

A law passed in October 2003 that was to make that possible was defeated in a referendum in April 2004, but the Interior Ministry then started restoring the status to those concerned directly based on the Constitutional Court's decisions. More erased were made eligible in legislative changes passed in 2010.

After the European Court of Human Rights ordered Slovenia in 2012 to put in place a compensation scheme, a law to that effect was passed in 2013, which came into force in June 2014.

The law gave the erased the option of settling for a lump sum of EUR 50 for every month they were erased, or taking legal action to claim higher compensation.

The erased had until 18 June 2017 to file applications or lawsuits with official data as of February 2022 showing that EUR 26.6 million had been paid out based on the lump-sum applications, and EUR 1.8 million based on court rulings until the end of 2021.","crime, law and justice",social issue

Laibach concert in Kyiv cancelled due to band's stance on conflict,"Laibach wrote it had been confronted with the categorical demand to explicitly state that all Russians are bad and that all Russian art is worthless, which is of course something they could not agree to.

The local organiser of the concert announced on social media that the event, meant to take place at the Bel Etage Music Hall in Kyiv, had been cancelled due to a heated controversy about the band's views on the causes of the war in Ukraine.

""In order not to divide Ukrainians into different camps, and to remove the cause of discord, we decided to cancel the Laibach concert in Bel Etage,"" the organiser wrote on Facebook.

""Despite the fact that the band expressed support for Ukraine and Ukrainians and condemned the Russian regime, a significant part of the audience expressed categorical opposition to Laibach's arrival,"" the post by the organiser moreover says.

Ukrainians were divided in the face of Laibach's claims that the current war is a geopolitical conflict between Russia and the US on Ukrainian territory.

The Guardian quoted the group as saying the conflict in Ukraine was ""a cynical proxy war for the geostrategic interests of the superpowers and financial capital (of the military industry, etc)"".

Many Ukrainian comments on Facebook likened this position to that of Russian state propaganda, which is portraying the ""special military operation"" as a conflict with NATO and is reducing Ukraine to a puppet of the West.

Laibach announced the concert in the Ukrainian capital last week, saying all the proceeds would be donated to charity.

After the critical commentaries in Ukraine, Laibach posted to Facebook three days ago that it is not coming to Ukraine ""to be the first, second or third group to perform in your capital during the war, as some media reported, but to clearly express support for your country in this war"".

""We must stress here that some of our statements, which may not have been in line with your thinking, were never intended to offend you in any way or to diminish the importance of your just struggle. Since the first days of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, we have taken an unequivocal position and reiterated that there is no place for war in a modern society.

""Geopolitical issues cannot be resolved by armed attack and political incitement. We also immediately cancelled all planned appearances in Russia and in all interviews condemned Russia's aggression in this war,"" the band added.

""Not to be mistaken - we love Russian literature, music and art...and we always will. But in this senseless war between Russia and Ukraine, we are wholeheartedly on the side of Ukraine and its people, who - as in the old biblical story of David and Goliath - are fighting with dignity against a stronger enemy,"" Laibach moreover wrote, stressing the decision for the concert had been the result of it ""following the call of the heart, not the call of reason"".","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"

Bilateral relations in focus of foreign minister's trip to Ethiopia,"This is the first visit by a Slovenian foreign minister in Ethiopia and is seen as a large step in strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries, the Slovenian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs said in a press release.

Fajon was quoted as saying that Ethiopia was an important political hub and the seat of the African Union. The ministry has said about the visit that the main objective was to strengthen relations between the countries, but Slovenia is also expected to seek support for its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2024-2025.

In her meetings, Fajon presented Slovenia's candidacy, as well an Africa Day, an international conference Slovenia is hosting every year. It is coming up in less than two weeks, scheduled for 20 and 21 April.

She also presented a diplomatic conference for the adoption of the Convention on International Cooperation in the Investigation and Prosecution of the Crime of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, scheduled for May.

""I wish the countries will strengthen bilateral cooperation, which is also one of the reasons for Slovenia to open an embassy in Addis Ababa. What is more, Ethiopia plays an important role for stability in the region,"" Fajon said in her meeting with the Ethiopian foreign minister.

They also discussed cooperation in multilateral forums and talked about international issues, as well as Slovenia's humanitarian aid projects. Touching on fields of cooperation, they talked about artificial intelligence, technology, tourism, student exchange programmes and the pharmaceutical industry.

Similarly, the meeting between Chala and Fajon focused on opportunities to strengthen trade. They agreed that there is room to grow trade, especially in apiculture, with Slovenia being able to offer know-how and technology to Ethiopia.

Fajon also met Ethiopia's Health Minister Lia Tadesse after the Ethiopian medications regulator approved import of pharmaceutical products from Slovenia.",education,education
Ukraine too helping Slovenia in the aftermath of devastating floods,"Ukraine has supplied five excavators and 14 other vehicles with crews to be used in the Upper Savinja Valley, the government says on its website.

Prime Minister Robert Golob will meet representatives of the Ukrainian civil protection in the convoy today, Golob's office said.

""Ukraine provides humanitarian aid to Slovenia in response to severe floods. I signed a relevant decree yesterday. We help our friends even as we fight a war at home. Solidarity works both ways"" Zelensky wrote.

The country had previously sent a helicopter to Slovenia to help with the search and rescue operations.

Zelensky expressed condolences to Slovenia in the face of the floods on Sunday and Golob thanked him for the words of solidarity and support.

Ukraine announced on Monday it would send help. ""The Ukrainian side will, in line with its capabilities, support its friends and partners that find themselves in trouble, just as Slovenia is supporting the Ukrainian nation and helping us divert Russian aggression,"" Oleg Nikolenko, spokesperson for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, wrote on social media.

Heavy machinery with crews also came from Germany, Slovakia, Italy and Bosnia-Herzegovina today. Hungary has also offered further assistance.

Germany sent two modular bridges and a team for their erection. A convoy of 27 vehicles and a unit of 45 members of the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief started erecting a temporary modular bridge in Prevalje so as to connect the area inhabited by several hundred people with the rest of the country, the civil protection said.

Six excavators from Bosnia-Herzegovina are also on their way to the Upper Savinja Valley. Four excavators with a team from Slovakia are helping out in the Rečica ob Savinji area.

Teams from Croatia, France, Germany and Austria are also helping out with heavy machinery in the Savinja Valley, President Nataša Pirc Musar said on X.

Two modular bridges and a team, two excavators and 15 other vehicles have also arrived from Italy and are helping out in Škofja Loka, the president said.

State secretary in the office of the Hungarian prime minister Zoltán Kovács said on X that Hungary was offering a 22-strong diving team equipped with all-terrain vehicles and boats, six pumps with operational staff, two excavators, two garbage trucks, two technical experts, sandbags and various flood protection equipment.

Vogel ski resort planning EUR 8.5m investments,"Like many other ski resorts, Vogel applied last year to the Economy Ministry's call for applications designed to help ski resorts become year-round destinations, as a way to help operators offset increasingly poorer winter seasons.

The new cable car will replace a 40-year-old two-seater in the area called Zadnji Vogel. The new car will be more environmentally friendly, faster and more comfortable.

""Boasting beautiful views, the car will also be running in the summer. It will also be able to carry bikes,"" Aleksandra Fiorelli of the operator Žičnice Vogel told the STA.

The company also intends to build a bike park and a disc golf park, and expand the existing children's playground.

Moreover, an Alpine archaeological hiking trail will be set up, with digital information boards allowing visitors to experience how life used to be in the mountains.

The operator is planning several other investments to replace old ski lifts, but these will likely have to wait.

The summer and winter seasons at Vogel have already become equal both in terms of revenue and the number of passengers.

Last year both the winter and summer seasons were very good at Vogel and the operator is expecting this year to be similarly successful. After a short period during which Vogel faced a lack of snow in December, there is now nearly a metre and half of snow.",lifestyle and leisure,lifestyle and leisure
Minister talks digital platform regulation at UNESCO conference,"The panellists agreed that digital platforms should commission regular external audits of machine learning tools used to moderate content, as well as independent evaluations of the effects of automatic content moderation tools on human rights, the ministry said.

Stojmenova Duh said that digital platforms should disclose information about why algorithms recommend certain content to users and whether they use algorithms to moderate and possibly delete content.

""Platforms should also reveal the algorithms that enable the spreading and promotion of misleading and false information and why some content spreads faster than others,"" the minister added.

She said that platforms should also reveal the impact of algorithms on freedom of expression and fundamental human rights, and that information about the role of algorithms should be clearly provided to users of digital platform services.

On the sidelines of the conference, Stojmenova Duh attended several bilateral meetings with UNESCO representatives.

She met with Tawfik Jelassi, UNESCO assistant director-general for communication and information, to discuss ways to strengthen Slovenia's cooperation with UNSECO in digital transformation.

The minister praised UNESCO's work in artificial intelligence (AI), digital inclusion and digital skills, and noted two major projects of UNESCO - open education sources and a competence framework for civil servants in AI and digital transformation.

Slovenia has participated in the former, Stojmenova Duh said, while noting that the latter ""promotes the trustworthy use of artificial intelligence and technologies in line with the sustainable development goals in public administration.""

Inclusion of Slovenia in the UNESCO pilot project was also a topic of discussion as the minister met UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education Stefania Giannini.

They agreed on Slovenia's participation in projects promoting greater digital inclusion through education, and also noted the importance of training and hiring of girls and women in the IT sector.

On the sidelines of the conference, which took place on 22-23 February, the minister also met UNESCO Assistant Director-General for the Social and Human Science Gabriela Ramos for talks about connecting Slovenia and UNESCO in the field of artificial intelligence.

They agreed that UNESCO experts can make a significant contribution by making recommendations to ensure that ethical principles are taken into account in the drafting of national policies and development of technologies.",science and technology,science and technology
Soldiers finally make their way to Črna na Koroškem,"The newspaper Večer reported online that the army with two helicopters and a total of 30 soldiers arrived in Črna in the morning, where the water severely damaged the main road in the valley. Some of the soldiers came on foot.

Šarec said that another SAF unit is making its way on foot to Ljubno and Solčava in roughly the same area in the north-east.

The extent of damage in Črna na Koroškem is not yet know as the municipality has been without telecommunications since Friday morning.

However, it is clear that the river Meža is flooding along its entire course, from Črna to Dravograd, damaging or destroying several bridges.

In the nearby town of Mežica, Austrian paramedics helped a mum with a 14-day-old baby, taking them to a hospital in Klagenfurt, reported the Austrian press agency APA.

The situation in other parts of Koroška remains rather difficult, including in Ravne na Koroškem, and in Slovenj Gradec, where the Mislinja also washed away part of the main road to Dravograd.

Dnevnik thinks Slovenian ski resorts should join forces,"Neighbouring countries north and west of Slovenia have been using this approach for decades, the paper says, noting that in Slovenia only the ski slopes that had the same owner offered a single ticket in the past, which was the case with Pohorje and Kranjska Gora, and Krvavec and Rogla.

It seems that things are moving in the right direction at least in Rogla, where the owners plan to offer services year around and use the synergies with the Pohorje destination.

Elsewhere each ski resort is working solo and not only that, even those renting the ski huts, hotels and managing the rest of the infrastructure at a single ski resort are not connected.

Until Slovenia realises it is a destination with two, maximum three mountain regions and until ski lift operators, restaurants and hotels start cooperating not even EUR 60 million in state and EU funds will save ski resorts from doom.

Small ski slopes with a dozen ski lifts simply cannot compete with mountain consortiums crossing regions across the border, Dnevnik says under the headline 'Ski Slovenia: On the Sunny Side of the Alps'.",lifestyle and leisure,lifestyle and leisure
Social transfer freeze raised as labour committee discusses budget,"Presenting the documents, Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Minister Luka Mesec told the MPs that the ministry had EUR 2.12 billion available this year, with the figure dropping to EUR 1.78 billion next year.

This is due to several reasons, including the establishment of the Ministry for Solidarity-based Future, which assumed the field of long-term care, the reactivation of fiscal rules due to which Slovenia is under pressure to reduce the deficit, and the recent catastrophic floods.

Mesec noted that the ministry was forced to freeze social transfers in 2024, which he said was ""particularly hurtful"", while he expressed satisfaction with the planned 8% indexation of pensions in the same period, in line with the recent indicators.

Among other measures with which some money could be saved or earned, he noted the improved collection of child support and renovation of the system of personal assistance combined with long-term care.

Some smaller measures are also planned, such as the abolition of an increased child allowance for parents of children who do not attend kindergarten, and the reduction of concessions to student employment agencies.

It is precisely the freezing of the growth of social transfers in the coming year that representatives of trade unions took issue with at today's session, and criticism was also levelled by both the opposition and coalition MPs.

Andrej Zorko of the ZSSS trade union confederation said that the non-indexation of social transfers was unacceptable, as this would mainly affect people who use this money to get basic life necessities.

This was echoed by the head of the Pergam trade union confederation Jakob Počivavšek, who also noted that the proposed budgets had not been coordinated in any way with social partners.

Opposition Democrats (SDS) MP Karmen Furman regretted the cuts in programmes concerning the most vulnerable groups, saying that if the roles were reversed, Mesec, who had spoken a lot about welfare state in the past, would be saying something completely different today.

Soniboj Knežak of the coalition Social Democrats (SD) called on the government to talk again about the freezing of social transfers in 2024, Milan Jakupovič of the Left said transfers should be indexed at the time of high inflation.

The session was also attended by representatives of the Ministry for Solidarity-based Future, which has EUR 190 million available this year, while the budget for 2024 is being cut to EUR 155.5 million, and increasing to EUR 272.8 million in 2025.

The committee members from the opposition noted the planned reductions in funds for long-term care and construction of housing facilities and care homes, and that the government was far behind when it comes to promises about the number of non-profit rental apartments.

Luka Omladič, a state secretary at the ministry, said that the reduction in investments was the result of the current situation, adding that ""we have tried to keep the most essential investments that are already under way.""

State Secretary Klemen Ploštajner said regarding the construction of non-profit apartments in the next two years that EUR 25.5 million had been earmarked for 2023, which was by far the largest amount of funds in a single year.

The same amount of funds is also planned for 2024 and 2025, adding that it had been estimated that the construction of 5,000 apartments can be funded and started by the end of the government's term, which is more than ever before.",labour,social issue

SSH managers' 50% higher pay upsets coalition parties,"According to a report in the newspaper Finance, chairman Žiga Debeljak will get a gross monthly pay of EUR 18,500, up from EUR 12,800, and board member Janez Tomšič will receive EUR 16,500 a month, up from EUR 11,500.

Chief supervisor Karmen Dietner told Finance on Thursday the reason for the pay raise was more work due to the energy crisis and SSH's absorption of the bad bank BAMC.

She also compared SSH managerial pay, which she said had not increased since 2013 except for inflation, with pay in the companies under the holding's wing.

The ruling Freedom Movement and both junior partners, the Social Democrats (SD) and the Left, are strongly against such a large increase.

Urška Klakočar Zupančič, National Assembly president and Freedom's vice-president, does not know the details but considers ""such a big raise absolutely unwarranted"".

Speaking for news site N1, she said on Friday that SSH ""is a state-owned company, which should be particularly sensitive about pay policy and comparable with private companies"".

A source in the Freedom Movement told N1 that such a big increase is also inappropriate because the government is in talks with the public sector to reach a pay deal.

MP Mojca Šetinc Pašek said it is against the efforts and values of the party she joined and against the government's policies, and expects the government to take action.

A similar call came from the SD, which urged the government to do all it takes to ""immediately limit such excessive pay of the SSH board"", to hold the supervisory board accountable for it and to make sure that before any pay raise is implemented a new strategy of state assets management is drafted and sent to parliament for adoption.

The argument about more work is not convincing for the party, which said the SSH had not yet drafted a new strategy on state-assets management, while the existing one is no longer realistic because of the changes to the structure of assets.

MP Matej T. Vatovec, deputy group leader of the Left, believes it is inappropriate for ""the best paid to further raise their pay during the cost-of-living crisis"".

The Left believes the SSH management has too much autonomy in this respect, especially compared to the public sector, which has been in talks on better pay for a year.

This is another instance of the current coalition disagreeing on SSH after last year's vote on new supervisors, most notably on former Gorenje CEO Franjo Bobinac.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

NATO's representative discusses women's participation in military,"Ahead of the meetings, the Defence Ministry said Fellin's two-day visit would be aimed at discussing challenges faced by women in decision making and their participation in Slovenia's public sector, particularly in the SAF.

Meeting Fellin, Fajon expressed Slovenia's full support for NATO's promotion and implementation of its women, peace and security agenda. They also discussed Slovenia's emerging feminist foreign policy, which Fajon has vowed to shape and promote during her term, Fajon's ministry tweeted.

Fellin thanked Fajon for a very fruitful exchange and congratulated her on her commitment to the development of feminist foreign policy. She is looking forward to closer cooperation in the run-up to the NATO summit in Vilnius in July.

Pirc Musar said that during her meeting with Fellin they discussed the role of women in NATO and in other areas. ""Women have an important role to play in addressing key contemporary challenges such as climate change, self-sufficiency and food security, the decline of biodiversity, the development of artificial intelligence and the rise of disinformation,"" the president said.

The pair agreed that, in order to effectively face these challenges, it is essential that women are included in the discussion as equals.

They also talked about human security, which includes the protection of civilians, the prevention of and response to conflict-related sexual violence, the fight against human trafficking, the issue of children in armed conflicts, and the protection of cultural heritage.

Moreover, they discussed the great importance of these issues being part of all core efforts of NATO, Pirc Musar tweeted.

Today, Fellin was also received by Aljoša Selan, deputy director general of the Defence Ministry's Directorate for Defence Policy.

Another Slovenian-founded church in US being sold,"For more than ten years now the church has been allowed to be open for mass on St Joseph's Day and for funerals, but the diocese's latest decision will put an end to this. The church will be closed again and then sold with unofficial sources saying that the deal is valued at some US$170,000.

In 2008, the Bishop of Allentown Edward Cullen decided to close many ethnic communities' churches due to priest shortages and austerity measures. The St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church was one of them, but the parishioners took the case to the Vatican and were then allowed to use the church occasionally.

Father Martin Krizolog, the parish priest of the Church of St Cyril, a Slovenian church in New York, was one of the priests saying masses in the S. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church. His own church in East Village faces the same fate in a few years as the church in Bethlehem.

The Diocese of Allentown decided to go through with the sale of the St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church because the Bethlehem parish lacks the money for the necessary renovation and maintenance works and had asked for the go-ahead to sell the building.

The closure and sale have been postponed to allow one last mass on St Joseph's Day, which will be celebrated on 18 March.

Meanwhile, the parishioners have no intention of giving up, and once more led by Stephen Antalics, a retired professor and the recipient of the Slovenian medal of merit, the community will strive to keep the church, perhaps to turn it into a museum.

The church was built by Slovenian immigrants who had gone from the region of Prekmurje to the US in search of a better life at the start of the 20th century. Funded by donations and erected on voluntary effort, the church opened its doors in 1914.

Also in the process of being sold is another church founded by Slovenians in Bethlehem - the Slovenian Protestant community's only church in the US, the St John's church. Since the relevant rules between the two Christian Churches differ, the Protestant community will be compensated for the loss of their church building, while the Catholic community will be left with nothing.",religion and belief,religion and belief
Luka Koper to pay out dividends of EUR 2.50 gross per share,"The remainder of the company's distributable profit in the amount of EUR 15.2 million will remain undistributed, the Pan-Slovenian Association of Small Shareholders announced.

This amount for dividends had been proposed by the management headed by the outgoing chairman Boštjan Napast after the operator of Slovenia's sole maritime port generated record results last year.

This year's dividend is more than twice as high as last year's, which amounted to EUR 1.14 euros gross per share. The state is to get the biggest cut, as it directly owns 51% of Luka Koper.

It also indirectly owns a 11.13% stake through Slovenian Sovereign Holding and a 4.98% stake through the Kapitalska Družba pension and disability fund.

Last year, Luka Koper generated EUR 313.5 million in net sales revenue and EUR 74.2 million in net profit at the group level, with the transshipment numbers reaching a new record.

The port operator is doing well this year as well, with the group generating EUR 80.1 million in net sales revenue and EUR 16.5 million in net profit in the first quarter.

Under the 2023 plans presented in April, the group is expected to record a 7% drop in net sales revenue this year in comparison to 2022, and net profit is expected to be halved, while transshipment is to remain at last year's levels.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Slovenian-French Business Forum explores cooperation opportunities,"Economy Ministry State Secretary Dejan Židan said Slovenia and France agreed about the need to reduce our dependence on third countries. The share of industry in Slovenia's GDP is 24%, which makes it one of the leading industrial countries in the EU.

The EU average is only 16%, which shows that the EU has made mistakes in this area over the past decades. This was particularly evident during the period of Covid-19, when supply routes were disrupted, Židan pointed out.

He argued the EU will need to re-industrialise, with the main topic here being the Chip Act. The EU produces only 10% of the world's chips, while consuming much more, and should thus increase its share to 20% in the coming years to achieve greater security of supply.

There are also problems in battery production, in absence of which e-mobility will not be met. There are opportunities for the two countries to work together in these areas, as well as in many others, Židan said.

France is Slovenia's top ten foreign trade partner and is listed as a priority foreign market in the government's plan for the internationalisation of the Slovenian economy, said Rok Capl, the acting director of the SPIRIT investment promotion agency, which has also been active on the French market for many years.

Almost 1,000 Slovenian companies export to France, and more than 70 companies with French capital operate in Slovenia. France offers many opportunities for exporters, including in the food and nutrition industry, pharmaceuticals, microelectronics, logistics and medical equipment, Capl pointed out.

Sectors with great potential include call centres, biotechnology, telecommunications, the ICT sector, e-commerce, e-mobility, advanced manufacturing, smart cities and the environment, he added.

French Ambassador to Slovenia Florence Levy agreed, citing sport as another area where she sees opportunities for cooperation, for instance in the production of sports equipment, from ski to cycling equipment. ""Let's not forget that France is hosting the Olympics next year, so sport will be at the forefront,"" she said.

The ambassador also presented France's economic strategy, which, she said, had made France one of the most competitive countries in the world last year. She pointed to the challenges facing France and the EU, ranging from the disruption of supply chains, uncertainty in markets and unfair practices by some countries.

France wants to boost innovation, retain employment and re-industrialise the economy, while of course honouring environmental requirements. There are also many opportunities for Slovenian companies to participate in this field, Levy said.

The forum, organised by SPIRIT, the French Embassy in Slovenia, the French-Slovenian Business Club in Slovenia and the Slovenian-French Business Club in Paris, continued with a panel discussion on how to encourage Slovenian companies to export to France.

The meeting concluded with presentations of individual companies, of the two clubs and with bilateral talks.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Coalition tables declaration on Palestine and Israel,"The draft declaration expresses deep concern at the escalation of violence and conflict and the worsening humanitarian situation in the Middle East, which it says threaten and undermine stability, peace and security in the EU's immediate neighbourhood.

It condemns in the strongest terms the attack on Israel by the ""radical armed group Hamas"" and stresses that terrorism and violence are unacceptable.

It also condemns any attack by Hamas or Israel on civilian targets and stresses that attacks on civilians, UN personnel, medical workers and journalists constitute a serious violation of international law.

The declaration recognises that Israel has the right under the UN Charter to defend itself and protect its citizens. However, it calls on Israel to respond to Hamas's attacks ""in accordance with international and humanitarian law since the Palestinian civilian population cannot bear the consequences"" of Hamas's terrorist acts.

Stressing the importance of distinguishing between the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspirations for a state of their own, and the radical armed group Hamas and its terrorist acts, it also expresses Slovenia's ""unwavering support for a negotiated two-state solution based on 1967 borders"".

It also calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the non-targeting of civilian objects, the establishment of a ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, the immediate establishment of humanitarian corridors, and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.

MPs urge the Slovenian government to continue its humanitarian activities in the Gaza Strip and to continue to support efforts in the international community to resolve the conflict.

The draft declaration was signed by all coalition MPs except the Left's Miha Kordiš, known for his radical pro-Palestinian views, and Mojca Šetinc Pašek, who was recently expelled from the Freedom Movement.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Ljubljana's iconic restaurant closes,"Located near Slovenia's parliament building, the headquarters of NLB and the Cankarjev Dom cultural centre, Maxim has for years been a place where the elite met either for business or pleasure.

Part of the Maximarket store complex, the restaurant has been managed by Mercator, Slovenia's largest retailer, which passed into Croatian ownership in 2014.

Maxim closed its doors in early May until further notice with the notice on its door citing difficult times for the hospitality sector as the reason.

""For the past year we truly aspired to maintain an appropriate level of service, but eventually we had to make this difficult but necessary decision, also for the sake of the restaurant's good name and its guests,"" reads the notice.

The management added that they were looking for a solution to reopen the restaurant, hopeful they will be able to welcome back their guests soon.

They said they were looking for suitable staff or a potential lessee for the restaurant.

Media have reported that the chef Peter Kovač had recently left the restaurant.

Launched in 1971, Maxim enjoyed the reputation as a prestigious Ljubljana restaurant, distinguished by its original dishes and culinary specialities made by internationally renowned chefs.

It won several culinary awards, including the Michelin Plate 2020 and the Gault & Millau award for top cuisine.","arts, culture and entertainment","arts, culture and entertainment"
Večer wonders what clinics for patients without GP will bring,"Clinics for patients without a named GP have opened the Pandora's box of primary healthcare - from now on, patients will not accept not being able to see a doctor, while doctors will no longer accept that they are not very well paid for their extra work.

The paper wonders whether this temporary measure really brings so many benefits for patients that it is worth everything it may entail.

Noting that it is a stop-gap measure, it says it is important whether it will be followed up with a deep change of the healthcare system, starting at primary level.

Since the measure is not extremely expensive for the national budget, it may well happen that decision-makers would not take the hard decisions towards health reform.

A shortage of doctors is not the only problem, as there are more doctors than there were several years ago, but a number of patients they sign was capped a few years ago.

The situation in healthcare is a result of years of postponing addressing all the troubles. Doctors are leaving the public system because they are fed up with the chaos there, while patients don't have this option, at least not all of them.",health,health
Slovenia's first multiplex cinema shuts down (adds),"""We would like o inform you that Kolosej is closing its doors on 14 March,"" the operator announced in a post to its website and social media.

""See you soon at Komuna,"" the post added in a reference to a cinema in the centre of Ljubljana, which has also been operated by Kolosej.

The building housing the Kolosej multiplex cinema at BTC was auctioned off to the Ajdovščina-based businessman Ivo Boscarol in September 2022 for EUR 6.4 million.

The building has been a bankruptcy estate since 2016 after its former owner, businessman Sergej Racman, cut off creditors and the multiplex was used as collateral.

When buying the property, Boscarol declared his intention to keep the cinema theatre business going, but said he would also like to set up a business and entertainment centre for various events.

In a press release, Boscarol confirmed that Kolosej is closing down for refurbishment. In the future it will open under a new name, Odiseja (Odyssey), and will feature ""additional new interesting content"".

More about the new activities and their providers and the start of operation should be known in the autumn.

Launched in May 2001, the multiplex has 12 theatres seating more than 3,300 people and spanning 14,513 square metres. The entire estate encompasses 10,000 square metres of land.

The cinema was initially hugely popular, attracting thousands of visitors. However, as debts started piling up and the cinema began to fall into disrepair, visitor numbers started dwindling.

In the meantime, multiplex cinemas started springing up in other parts of the country and last year a much more modern Cineplexx was launched at Ljubljana's Rudnik borough.","arts, culture and entertainment","arts, culture and entertainment"
Đorđević appointed Supreme Court president,"Đorđević was endorsed by the coalition, while the opposition Democrats (SDS) opposed his appointment. The party believes he is not an appropriate candidate for the job and that his candidacy was ""a reflection of severe negative selection in the judiciary"".

The minister noted last week that the Judicial Council had highlighted Đorđević's expertise, including a years-long career as judge, his cooperation in international projects, and projects concerning human rights, insolvency law and competition protection, and she nominated him on the basis of expert opinions.

She also said last week that the government would soon put forward new legislation under which the National Assembly would be excluded from appointment procedures regarding Supreme Court judges.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Court agrees with KPK in breach of integrity case,"Polanec, professor at the Ljubljana School of Economics and Business, breached integrity by forwarding the state-owned export and development bank's 2021-2023 development strategy, a confidential document, to Marko Mlakar, director of the recruitment agency Amrop Adria.

He did this despite a verbal objection by a SID Banka employee and without obtaining the consent of the management board, the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (KPK) said.

Following the court's decision, the watchdog's findings are now final in what is the 24th confirmed breach of integrity and fourth this year, reads the watchdog's press release.

The KPK initiated the procedure against Polanec after receiving a complaint in February 2022. Polanec took legal action against the watchdog, but in late June this year the court dismissed the action and upheld the watchdog's decision.

Polanec was appointed SID Banka supervisor in 2020, under the Janez Janša government, but he resigned in 2021, shortly after forwarding the confidential document, citing personal reasons.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
New health minister announces changes to three systemic laws (interview),"Putting together her team, the new minister plans to hire advisors for the three key priority areas - accessibility, quality, and sustainable financing of health services and the basket of rights. Former Health Minister Dorjan Marušič will also join her team, but it is not yet clear what his role will be.

The ministry has sent the key guidelines for the next two years to the ZZZS for it to include them in the draft agreement for next year. While the ZZZS believes it had fulfilled the ministry's expectations, the minister says not all guidelines had been included in the agreement.

She did no go into detail, but she said she had made it clear that she would like the agreement to include all the guidelines. ""All that we have included in the guidelines is important,"" she stressed.

The general agreement for next year is to introduce measures the ministry wants to implement that do not require changes to the legislation. They include educational clinics, where GP specialty registrars could accept patients with support from health professionals and mentors.

The ministry is also in talks with the Medical Chamber on the possibility of allowing specialty registrars in other fields to work in family medicine clinics during their rotations.

The ZZZS has until the end of November to draw up the general agreement and coordinate the measures with health services providers. If it fails, the ministry will have to adopt a decree. Prevolnik Rupel says that in the future this procedure might be changed as there is very little time for drawing up the decree.

One of the first legislative proposals that the ministry will present under Prevolnik Rupel will deal with the organisation and management of the ZZZS. The changes are to ""enable the fund a more flexible and active purchasing of health services"".

""The fund should be buying the services that citizens need at the maximum possible quality and the best possible price,"" she said. If the needs of the citizens change, so must the purchase of services, she said.

Asked whether she felt the ZZZS was doing a good job, she said that ""managing the fund is a very complex matter and one person alone has difficulty running it"". This is why the ministry plans to change the law to create a ""more efficient way of managing the institute that manages an enormous amount of money"".

Among the planned legislative changes, Prevolnik Rupel also highlighted a new bill on digitalisation that will create more transparency and data connectivity, which will be crucial for implementing the planned measures. She said that after a legislative proposal on digitalisation did not garner support in the coalition a new bill was almost ready for discussion.

An emergency law is also planned to extend the duration of some of the good solutions introduced by previous emergency laws. But the minister does not agree with all measures introduced previously. One such measure is paying for health services according to realisation which allowed for additional work of employees to be paid under contracts that are not taxed.

Analyses have also shown than while this measure was successful for one-off procedures such as a varicose vein surgery, it was not good for on-going services such as cardiological examinations, where the number of patients waiting for the first examination for too long has increased drastically as a result of the measure.

The minister plans more complex and targeted measures in this area that will be included in the general agreement for next year.

The ministry also plans to overhaul three systemic laws - the Medical Services Act, the Health Care and Health Insurance Act, and the Health Services Act.

Moreover, the ministry plans to review doctors employed in public health institutions who also work in other institutions and the concessions granted. ""Over the years, various practices have developed and they need to be reviewed. However, I do not want a solution that would radically divide the public and private health care segments and reduce access to health services,"" the minister said.

A new task force at the ministry is also working on ways to measure the quality of work.

The ZZZS raised dust recently by announcing that it expected a deficit of EUR 140 million in 2024 because top-up health insurance will be transformed into a mandatory contribution paid directly to the healthcare budget.

Prevolnik Rupel would like the basket of rights to be reviewed as soon as possible, ""ideally by the end of the year"". But given that the ZZZS's deficit in 2024 will be covered by the state in line with the law, ""there is definitely time for this until the end of 2024"", she said.

The new minister also said that unlike her predecessor Danijel Bešič Loredan, she will not forecast when each measure will be implemented. ""I think forecasts are risky, as healthcare is a complex system, and I want to prepare all measures in dialogue with all stakeholders,"" she said, noting she planned to present measures when they are actually ready.",health,health

"Another batch of storms causes damage, especially in west, north-east (adds)","The first wave of rapidly-moving storms reached Slovenia from Italy last evening at around 9pm, with hailstones as big as eggs or apples wreaking havoc in north Primorska, the broader area around Nova Gorica, the Vipava Valley and Kras.

Thousands remained without power as the wind knocked down power lines in north Primorska and in the regions of Štajerska and Prekmurje in the north-east, but electricity teams are working fast and the situation is improving.

Civil protection units in Štajerska, including around Celje in the municipality of Šentjur, reported night-time incidents in many municipalities, from lighting-related fires, roof damages, flooded homes, landslides and fallen trees.

North Primorska has been severely affected, with a heavy hail storm damaging roofs, windows, cars and crops. No building is said to have been spared in the town of Čepovan. Rescue teams are there helping out and will be joined by some 30 soldiers. The area has been ""eerily devastated"", said Nova Gorica Mayor Samo Turel.

Rescue teams are yet to reach some areas around Čepovan as some roads are still blocked. Civil Protection commander Srečko Šestan said the exact damage is hard to asses yet, but based on his the experience it could reach tens of millions of euros.

Defence Minister Marjan Šarec visited north Primorska, including Čepovan and Orehovlje, saying it is urgent to bring as many tarpaulins and hoists to protect the houses, and to fully restore electricity supply.

Extensive damage has been caused to crops in north Primorska, especially in the Vipava Valley, Goriška Brda and Kras, with 30-100% of the plants estimated ruined. Buildings and machines at farms have also been damaged, as have been some hail protection nets.

In the northern regions of Gorenjska and Koroška, the wind tore roofs off buildings and uprooted trees, while torrential waters flooded basements and triggered landslides. The worst hit in Koroška is the municipality of Črna na Koroškem, where torrential waters are flooding, with soldiers helping out.

Visiting Črna na Koroškem, Minister for Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Uroš Brežan said it seemed such storms would become a constant, so systemic changes, including prevention regarding watercourses, would be needed to prepare for this.

The weather is expected to gradually calm down on Wednesday.

At their regular monthly working meeting on Tuesday, President Nataša Pirc Musar and PM Robert Golob discussed ways of dealing with the consequences of recent storms. They agreed that to address climate change comprehensive policies are needed to help protect people and their property, the environment and natural resources.

The pair thanked all rescue teams taking part in the rescue and clear-up efforts, from firefighters and soldiers to Civil Protection and police, for their help.",weather,weather
National Assembly president happy with work done in first year,"She believes she has done her job fairly since taking over a year ago, adding that she had learnt a lot during this time, especially in terms of communicating with the public. ""I've made some mistakes, for which I've apologised, and critiques were justified,"" she said on Friday

Since having been sworn in, the 90-member National Assembly convened 44 session, of which 35 were emergency sessions. During this time, 174 bills were tabled, of which 100 were passed, in addition to 117 other documents, Klakočar Zupančič said.

The National Assembly also discussed two ouster motions, the first against the former Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar, who later resigned, and a motion against Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, as well as an interpellation against the entire cabinet. None of the motions were successful.

The National Assembly president said that the government coalition of the Freedom Movement, the Social Democrats and the Left had faced a number of obstacles by the two opposition parties, the Democrats and the New Slovenia.

Klakočar Zupančič, a vice president of the Freedom Movement, said these obstacles were legal but that voters would decide in the next election whether they were legitimate.

""This approach more or less only slows down and hinders the coalition's work and the implementation of its programme, which has received a majority support from citizens at the election,"" the National Assembly president said.

In the future, she hopes the National Assembly will be able to facilitate systemic change by passing key legislation, for example on healthcare and social care.

Klakočar Zupančič believes that a change for the better has been achieved in the communication in the National Assembly. She believes MPs had come to realise that respectful communication, even when expressing criticism, helps to improve communication at all levels.

""We will continue in this effort and show that we as a mature and responsible, but also a critical society, and that we are aware of the consequences inappropriate communication can have in all segments of society.""",politics,politics
SDS outraged by Zemljarič's funeral with military honours (adds),"The SDS finds the government's decision on Zemljarič, who served in 1975-1976 as the director of the UDBA intelligence agency that was in fact a secret police, as fundamentally at odds with the spirit of the Slovenian constitution, which is based on respect for human dignity, human rights and the rule of law.

The former secret police was an institutionalised antithesis of the fundamental constitutional values of today's independent Slovenia, the opposition party wrote, adding that ""both the Slovenian Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court have formally recognised the activities of UDBA as criminal in various decisions"".

""The abuse of military honours to glorify the head of a criminal organisation is, last but not least, an insult to the Slovenian Armed Forces, which were founded on the basis of resistance against the repressive Yugoslav regime, of which UDBA was an integral part for decades,"" the SDS added.

Senior SDS member France Cukjati added in the capacity of the head of the conservative group Assembly for the Republic that Zemljarič had also held other top-ranking posts in the communist regime and ""demonstrated a distinctly undemocratic attitude towards opponents of totalitarianism"".

These sentiments were echoed by the Association for the Values of Slovenian Independence (VSO), whose press release is entitled ""Values of Slovenian Independence Buried with Zemljerič"". VSO head and Slovenia's first Prime Minister Lojze Peterle wrote that Slovenia had left behind a totalitarian political regime that systematically violated human rights when it decided for independence.

""We are not concerned with a comprehensive evaluation of Mr Zemljarič's legacy, but we believe that, as one of the main protagonists of the former totalitarian system, he is not entitled to the above-mentioned honour,"" Peterle wrote.

This view is moreover shared by the Association of Political Prisoners and Other Victims of Communist Violence, which wrote that the burial of Zemljarič with military honours makes a mockery of the suffering of the many victims of UDBA's criminal activities.

Zemljarič, who died on his 94th birthday on 30 December, was the prime minister of the Slovenia Socialist Republic's government between 1980 and 1984, whereupon he spent five years as deputy prime minister of the federal Yugoslav government. He also served as interior minister in 1978-1980.

Described by the newspaper Delo as ""one of the most influential men in Slovenia in the last fifty years"", Zemljarič also had a huge impact beyond politics.

He oversaw the construction of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, of which he was the first director in 1968-1973, and managed the construction of the Cankarjev Dom, the country's largest arts centre, which opened in 1980.

After the collapse of Yugoslavia, he spent his time as a lobbyist. He was often mentioned as a power broker with good connections to leftist parties but always remained in the background.

While never admitting to any wrongdoing, he also had to fend off allegations he knew about murders of the opponents of the communist regime during his stint as UDBA director and was a popular target of conservative politicians amidst recurrent revelations about UDBA's activities.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Report: German company buys Beti's debt,"Medi, a leading global manufacturer of medical equipment based on compression technology and a producer of sports and fashion products under the ITEM m6 and CEP brands, bought the EUR 3.9 million in claims at the end of last year from the Bank Assets Management Company (BAMC), which has since merged with Slovenian Sovereign Holding (SSH), Dnevnik reported.

SSH would not reveal who bought the claims and for how much money, noting only that it was a strategic buyer from the textile industry.

Unofficial information indicates that the Germans are also interested in buying a share in Beti, but its sole owner, Viktor Kozjan, would not comment on this for the paper.

The Metlika-based company struggled for years. After the 2013 court-mandated debt restructuring, the company's operations stabilised but it was still unable to secure funds for growth and development or pay off its liabilities.

The company employing some 150 people also abandoned its production of underwear and focussed on the dyed polyamide yarns. Today it is a global leader in this segment, with the list of its buyers including multinational corporation Nike.

According to CEO Maja Čibej, Beti broke even last year, generating sales revenue of around EUR 11 million, up from EUR 9.6 million in 2021. But the increase was mainly due to the rise in the product prices.

The company exports 97% of its products, of which half goes to EU countries and most of the rest to Turkey and the US. Until last year, Russia had also been an important market.

Despite the lack of funds for investment, the company managed to develop new types of yarns in recent years with its development focussing on sustainable materials. It also uses about 15% of recycled materials, the CEO told the paper.",sport,"economy, business and finance"
Trade unions divided on public sector wage reform proposal,"The FIDES trade union of doctors and dentists is in favour of the proposal for the elimination of wage disparities in the sector and adjustment of jobs to a new wage scale, while the Trade Union of Health Care and Social Care finds the proposal unacceptable.

FIDES head Damjan Polh said on Monday that the proposal is fixing the injustices caused by a deal struck in December when young doctors saw their wages increase by more brackets than their more senior colleagues.

The proposal puts other employees in health and social care at a disadvantage as they would gain one or two brackets fewer than doctors, if the existing and proposed increases are taken into account, said Irena Ilešič Čujovič, head of the Union of Health Care and Social Care.

Some issues remain unresolved, including the proposed leave reductions, which Ilešič Čujovič deemed as drastic. The leave reductions would not save money, but instead lead to more sick leaves and resignations, she said.

Both unions doubt that an agreement can be reached by 15 October, which is the government's wish. The expectations that the specifics of the sectors would be taken into consideration have been dashed, said Polh.

The teachers' trade union SVIZ and the Trade Union of Higher Education are strongly opposed to the proposal with SVIZ head Branimir Štrukelj calling it an attack on the quality of public education.

It is inconsistent and unfair to those with the highest level of education, head of the higher education union Gorazd Kovačič told the STA.

The proposal does not solve wage disparities, said Štrukelj, who told the STA that the government is likely running out of time and is not fit for the task so it opted for ""a much simpler increase of wages"".

Workers in different segments of the public sector with the same level of education are paid differently, noted Štrukelj, adding that the proposed flat increase of brackets would transfer the disparities to the new pay system, making it as unstable as the current one.

Work in culture and research, especially in mid-level positions, is ""insultingly poorly paid"", he said.",education,labour

Paper critical of ban on internal combustion engines,"""Europe's leading politicians have seized on vehicle electrification as a lifeline to tackle climate catastrophe,"" the paper says in Green Alternative or Fad.

It says that Europe's No. 1 enemy is no longer Russian President Putin but cars with petrol and diesel engines, at least judging by the European Parliament's decision.

However, electric cars are far from being clean. Greenhouse gases are produced during their production and during the production of electricity they use to charge batteries, while lithium mining and the decommissioning of old batteries are also far from being environmental friendly.

""Paradoxically, we are fighting pollution by turning to cars"". Instead of seeking sustainable solutions, we will invest billions of euros in a network of charging stations and new roads, while further deepening inequality when electric cars are an expensive entertainment that only the rich can afford.

It is understandable that politicians find it easier to impose a ban while turning a blind eye to other producers of greenhouse gases (freight transport, aviation, ships, animal husbandry, armed forces ...), especially because electric cars are the latest fad successfully marketed by businessmen, such as Elon Musk.",environmental issue,environmental issue

Efforts to strengthen integrity key for corruption prevention,"""Public integrity is one of the cornerstones of a stable social system, particularly as we live in a time marked by multifaceted and complex global societal challenges, including those related to the development of social networks,"" National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič told the conference in an opening address on Wednesday.

When civil servants prioritise private interests over the needs of society, they start undermining the foundations of the very idea that they answer to their citizens and voters, she added.

KPK head Robert Šumi also highlighted the importance of trust in his address, describing it as the cornerstone of the rule of law and democracy.

""Together, united on European level, we are working hard to strengthen the forces of good and eliminate the forces of evil,"" he said, adding that it was civil servants' duty to serve as role models for the rest.

Corruption is one of the most challenging areas of crime to tackle, as it is often difficult to detect and fight, and the interests of all involved are great, said Justice Ministry State Secretary Valerija Jelen Kosi.

Criminal law instruments are not sufficient in this fight, so strong prevention measures are necessary too, including solid mechanisms of monitoring different decision-making processes and disbursement and spending of public funds, she added.

ENPE head Didier Migaud believes that the fight against foreign interference remains the main concern of European democracies, which must protect themselves against covert influence.

The aim of the conference is to identify measures to prevent corruption more effectively, promote transparency, public sector integrity and accountability, and tackle undue influence in democratic societies.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"

Children charity calls for neonatal screening for spinal muscular atrophy,"""In Slovenia, a child can only be diagnosed with SMA after the onset of symptoms, such as severe muscle weakness in the legs. This means that, despite receiving treatment with remarkable new drugs, the child may remain disabled for life and need a wheelchair,"" said Nejc Jelen, the president of the Viljem Julijan charity.

If rare diseases are not detected at birth, they can cause irreversible damage. Neonatal screening for SMA would mean that treatment could start immediately, giving the child a chance to develop normally.

The Viljem Julijan charity has launched an initiative to screen newborns for SMA already in 2020, with new biological and genetic treatments having been available since 2017.

The charity said it had been approached by SMA Europe, an umbrella organisation representing SMA patients, over this issue.

While Slovenia is yet to introduce the screening, some other eastern European countries, such as Croatia, Poland and Ukraine, have already done so.

In Slovenia, newborns are currently screened for about 20 rare diseases, with the national screening programme set to increase this number to 40.",health,health

<b>Court rules tax procedure law incompatible with constitution</b>

LJUBLJANA - The Constitutional Court has found the Tax Procedure Act to be incompatible with the constitution because it does not clearly state how the tax rate is determined when tax evasion is established.

Cross-border children's reading project celebrates 10 years,"Mirjana Čubaković from the primary school in Budaševo-Topolovac-Gušče near the town of Sisak in Croatia, and Mirjam Dolinar Klavž of the Brothers Polančič primary school in Maribor, came up with the concept that sees Slovenian children reading translations of Croatian authors and Croatian children reading translations of works by Slovenian authors.

The first year students from Croatia visited Maribor and the next year, students from Maribor visited their Croatian friends and another ten schools joined the project.

Teachers and librarians have complete freedom as regards activities and methods, which can be adapted to the abilities and needs of their students. But there are three key aspects that need to be observed: books are read out loud, children have to experience the cultural heritage of the partner town and prepare a public performance.

Children love this approach, Čubaković told the STA. ""They are happy to do the activities with their teachers and librarians. But they are most happy about getting to know their Slovenian peers and nurture friendships.""

Despite the popularity of the project, it faces two significant problems. The first is lack of funding for the end trip in some schools, and the second is the lack of translations.

""The books in school libraries are mostly outdated and not as interesting for our students. We'd be grateful if good contemporary Slovenian youth literature were translated more into Croatian and vice-versa,"" Čubaković said.",education,education
SAF to participate in 44 exercises abroad this year,"According to Colonel Igor Šepec, the extent of the military exercises will be similar to that of 2022 with more activities held in Slovenia to offer support to allied troops. He estimated that every member of the Slovenian Armed Forces will attend at least one military exercise this year, along with around 1,000 allied troops.

Adriatic Strike that will take place from 29 May to 9 June, will host some 800 troops, 400 of which from the 27 allied and partner countries. The exercise will train certified Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, shooting platform teams, commanders up to the division level and Forward Air Controllers, said Colonel Janez Gaube. In the exercise 18 aircraft and 19 helicopters will be used.

The Triglav Star exercise that is usually held in September will this year take place in the second half of May in the north-west region of Gorenjska with some 750 members of armed forces from eight countries. ""The goal is to perform a two-sided tactical exercise of the mountain regiment and allies in the mountains,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Tomaž Žbogar.

Members of Slovenian Armed Forces will attend trainings and exercises in Italy, Germany and Croatia.

The SAF command organises and conducts training and military exercises in Slovenia and abroad, aiming to keep the public informed on their activities, noted General Major Roman Urbanč.

"Storms damage 10,000 hectares of farmland in two weeks (adds)","KGZS president Roman Žveglič told the STA that the chamber's services are still assessing the damage and forwarding data to the Agriculture, Forestry and Food Ministry.

However, first estimates show that, since last Friday, 7,000 hectares of crops, orchards and vineyards have been affected.

Given the damage caused before that, a total of 10,000 hectares of area where food is grown have been damaged, and this does not include meadows affected by floods.

The chamber now expects the government to draft an emergency bill to help farmers, while urging it to include storms in the systemic Natural Disaster Recovery Act so that farmers affected by extreme weather events are eligible for state aid.

The new legislation should bring not only an immediate assessment of damage and financial assistance but also measures such as tax base reduction; tax and contributions write-off; reduction in forest road charges; and solidarity allowance for the elderly.

One of the measures should also be allowing wine growers to buy grapes; in normal circumstances, they are allowed to process only their own grapes, Žveglič explained.

The chamber also wants damage caused by landslides to arable land and permanent plantations to be assessed, as it could go into tens of thousands of euros.

""Landslides pose a risk to houses, stables and manure pits. If landslides continue, ecological disasters may occur as a result,"" said Žveglič.

Given the increasing weather-related damage to agriculture, the KGZS would also like an active hail protection system to be set up across the entire country.

Asked whether farmers do not take enough precautions to protect their property from the extreme weather, such as hail, he said ""they adapt as much as they can"". As for droughts, he said an irrigation action plan is in the making.

Farmer representatives will discuss all these measures this afternoon at a meeting with Prime Minister Robert Golob.

Monday's hailstorm that hit northern Primorska - the broader area around the western city of Nova Gorica - damaged 20% to 100% of all crops, according to initial estimates.

Damaged are orchards and vineyards, which were affected the most, as well as vegetables and other crops, Vasja Juretič from the Nova Gorica Chamber of Agriculture told the STA.

Peach orchards are very damaged. ""Orchards with peaches where harvesting has already started are almost entirely ruined. Perhaps there are few locations where the situation is better, but in this part where there are the most intensive peach orchards, I think we can talk about 70% damage.""

Worst hit were the municipalities of Miren-Kostanjevica, Šempeter-Vrtojba and Renče-Vogrsko and parts of the municipality of Nova Gorica. ""Interestingly, the storm hit a very large area, which is not usual for hail,"" he said.

Greenhouses and forests were also hit hard.

In its preliminary estimate the Forest Service said more than 540,000 m3 of timber has been damaged in the July storms so far, which represented 10% of the annual felling of tress in Slovenia.

""If the trees attacked by the bark beetle that are marked to be felled are added to that, more than million cubic metres of timber is currently damaged, which represents a fifth of the annual felling of timber in Slovenian forests,"" it added.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
Exhibition to celebrate Path along the wire architect,"The exhibition, titled Vlasto Kopač: The Unwavering Humanist, showcases the different areas of his work. He studied under the renowned architect Jože Plečnik and went on to also work in graphic design, conservation and mountaineering.

According to exhibition curator Ana Porok, Kopač showed his dedication in architecture, art, graphic design, conservation, research of ethnologic and linguistic heritage, mountaineering and journalism.

His works are not characterised as avant-garde, revolutionary or extravagant but are a logical consequence of the school of Plečnik, his ethic principles and understanding of the moral responsibility of the architect, Porok wrote.

Kopač (1913-2006) became the student of the renowned architect Jože Plečnik in 1934, setting up a wooden board on two sawhorses to fit into the otherwise full class. Plečnik soon recognised Kopač as a hard-working and talented student and invited him to work on his projects, including the planning of the Žale cemetery.

At the start of World War II, Vlasto Kopač, a dedicated communist, joined the resistance movement and worked as a graphic designer and illustrator. He was also involved in an underground printing operation, forging identification papers to allow resistance fighters to move around undetected.

In October 1943 he was arrested and taken to the Dachau concentration camp. He returned home in 1945 but was imprisoned following a politically motivated trial. He was released in 1952 and his sentence was overturned some two decades later.

After WWII, Kopač dedicated himself to designing numerous monuments, memorials, and tombstones honouring the victims of the national liberation struggle, including the Path Along the Wire, a trail around Ljubljana in memory of the barbed wire that kept the city under the lockout during WWII. A memorial event is held every year with more than 30,000 people walking the path.

Even after his retirement Kopač helped renovate some of Plečnik's projects, including the Žale cemetery and the Ljubljana market.

He was also active as a conservationist and made efforts to protect the scenic Velika Planina mountain and help its tourist development. A friend of the locals, he researched shepherd architecture and its development and collected ethnographic objects. He designed the funicular stations and different holiday cottages.

The material presented at the exhibition comes from the Plečnik collection of the Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana and from the private collection of Kopač's daughter.","arts, culture and entertainment","arts, culture and entertainment"
Consumer confidence down for first time this year,"All four sub-indicators deteriorated compared to May.

Expectations for the financial situation in the household decreased by seven percentage points. Consumers' assessments of the current financial situation in the household and expectations for the financial situation in the country dropped by four percentage points. Expectations for large purchases were down two percentage points.

Compared to June 2022, the expectations for the financial situation in the household improved by seven percentage points, while the expectations for the financial situation in the country grew by four percentage points.

The other two components recorded a decrease year-on-year, the assessment of the current financial situation in the household lost ten percentage points and expectations for large purchases lost three.

Consumers' assessments on price developments in the past year have reached the highest level ever, showing that more and more consumers are affected by rising prices.

The assessment on price developments for the coming 12 months has been slowly decreasing, which means that fewer consumers expect a higher inflation rate.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

They are calling on the confederation to monitor organisers more closely to avoid such situations in the future.

Amendments passed to make administrative court more efficient,"The changes were passed in a 61:21 vote on Tuesday with Justice Minister Dominika Švarc Pipan saying that this would increase the efficiency of the Administrative Court proceedings.

This is a key step forward in ensuring that bottlenecks in the Slovenian judiciary are dealt with actively, with administrative disputes and administrative court proceedings at the top of the priority list, the minister said.

This will help speed court proceedings as the changes will take effect right away and will apply also to ongoing cases where the main hearing has not been held yet.

Provisions are also being introduced promoting settlement in administrative disputes and in cases processed by the Administrative Court.

The changes will also affect the Supreme Court when deliberating on appeals. If the case is decided by a single judge at the court of first instance, an individual supreme judge will decide on appeal. If a panel decides at the first instance, a panel will decide on appeal.

The largest opposition party, the Democrats (SDS), tabled an amendment that would make Administrative Court hearings on election-related disputes before an election open to the public to increase transparency.

But the coalition disagreed, saying that the court had to decide on such matters as quickly as possible, within 48 hours, so holding a public hearing would not make sense. The proposal was voted down.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Mladina calls for general strike over price hikes,"In Slovenia, prices are rising not because of costlier energy, higher wages and costlier financing but because of greed. ""Capitalism takes advantage of destabilisation and confusion again and again to make more additional profits; this is a holiday for capitalism.""

Last year electricity prices skyrocketed because of the war, even though there was no shortage: energy traders large and small (including Slovenian, even mostly state-owned companies) were just abusing the war and fear. It was sheer war profiteering.

""But we can still see it today: the economy is screaming that it is being broken by the consequences of two crises, companies are still talking about high energy prices, even though these prices have long since fallen to pre-war levels.""

They are demanding state aid and attacking the government, even though the aid in Slovenia has been comparable to that in Germany, for example, and official data show that that a significant part of the Slovenian economy not only posted profit last year but record high profit.

The government imposed monitoring of prices in the food supply chain this week to see who in the chain is raising the prices and contributing the most to inflation. ""This will undoubtedly have some effect. But the prices of food are not the only ones rising. The prices of services have also gone wild, and everyone is using the fact that in the period of inflation we have all lost the sense of how much things should cost in these changed circumstances.""

The exceptional profits recorded last year are a clear sign to Slovenian private sector trade unions that they must demand a new national collective bargaining agreement and EU standards. If nothing else works, they should stage a general strike, Mladina says.

The government should finally side with employees and open these negotiations, because this is an area, which has been unchanged for years, an area where Slovenia has been lagging behind the West the most, concludes the commentary Time for General Strike.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"

Regulator says health insurance biggest risk to insurers,"Supplementary insurance premiums account for a quarter of gross premiums written, which totalled EUR 2.55 billion last year.

The government froze monthly premiums at EUR 35.67, making supplementary health insurance, which is offered by three insurers, unsustainable, the agency's director Gorazd Čibej said.

The last time premiums rose was in 2019, but since then the cost of health services covered by this type of insurance has risen substantially.

As a result, the three insurance companies are posting significant losses, which also affects their capital adequacy, said Čibej.

He did not wish to disclose exact figures but said they have shared then with the government.

So far the insurers have covered the losses by releasing provisions, but ""this path is slowly closing,"" he said.

The frozen premiums will presumably be in place until the end of the year since supplementary health insurance is expected to be folded into mandatory health insurance by then.

Once that happens, the three insurers will no longer face capital adequacy problems, he said, describing the abolition of supplementary insurance as ""a relief of sorts.""

But once supplementary insurance no longer exists, it is uncertain what the reformed health system and health insurance will be like.

The agency expects that insurers will develop new health insurance products, but the scope thereof depends on the future structure of the health system and the balance between public and private healthcare.

Overall, the insurance, reinsurance and pension insurance sector remains stable. Capital adequacy dropped slightly in 2022 but remains high, according to Čibej.

Last year gross written premiums rose by about 6% in nominal terms, but this represents a decline of 4.6% in real terms due to high inflation.

The sector's net profit dropped by 19% to just under EUR 180 million, which the agency says is still very good given the demanding conditions.",health,health

She suggested this was necessary to ensure food security in the face of Covid aftermath and the Ukraine war. In order for the country to be able to react effectively and quickly to such external factors affecting the functioning of the food chain, a mechanism should be established for collecting and monitoring data from the farmer to the buyer, she said.

Milestone reached in public sector pay reform talks,"Peter Pogačar of the Public Administration Ministry told the press that an agreement had been reached on how the salaries would be converted to the planned new pay scale. Pay disparities would be addressed simultaneously.

He added that today's round of talks, the last one before a month-long summer break, had confirmed that the ministry was steering things in the right direction and inspired ""optimism"" that the 1 January 2024 target for implementation was ""absolutely attainable"".

Reflecting on the pay system reform efforts, which have been a priority for the government ever since it took over last year but have been marked by strike threats, strikes and separate deals with individual groups, Pogačar stressed that a truly large number of jobs would be affected.

While acknowledging a lot of work remained to be done, Pogačar said the wish was to make the pay system for the sector, involving roughly 190,000 employees and a wage bill of around EUR 5 billion, as transparent and fair as possible.

Branimir Štrukelj, the head of the KSJS trade union confederation, agreed that ""it seems that some turning point was reached today, although it is very risky to be optimistic in pay negotiations"".

Fellow unionist Jakob Počivavšek, who is one of the leading negotiators, added that the basic solutions of the mechanism had been agreed, but there were still a number of uncertainties, in particular with regard to the elimination of pay disparities and how these would affect the conversion.",labour,labour
New bill on Slovenia's digital transformation in the making,"Implementing the 'digital first' principle, the new law will make sure that ""nobody will ask you to sign a document by hand any more but a digital signature will fully suffice"", the minister told the press.

E-signature is enough even under the current legislation but some still demand meetings in person or documents sent by regular mail, she said. The new law will enable documents to be safely delivered digitally, she stressed.

The draft bill is ready and will be finalised during the summer before it is sent to ministries for discussion. It is not clear when the bill could be passed, but Stojmenova Duh hopes it will be this year.

The minister also pointed to the European Chips Act, which aims to strengthen the EU's role in the production of computer chips. The EU is currently producing around 10-12% of all chips, but wants to raise this share to at least 20% in the coming years. The EU will spend more than EUR 40 billion to support this industry, and member states are also expected to invest in this field.

In Slovenia, the ministries of digital transformation, higher education, science and innovation, and economy, tourism and sport have joined forces with the Chip.SI Competence Centre, which brings together Slovenian research organisations and companies.

Together, they presented their plans, including funding, to the European Commission. ""The ministries will provide the funds ourselves within the possibilities we have in our budgets, and we will also help the competence centre to access EU funding,"" Stojmenova Duh said.

The ministries have also been successfully cooperating with Austrian counterparts. Several Austrian companies produce chips, while Slovenian companies are very good at designing and developing them.

The Ministry for Digital Transformation also plans to set up 222 Digi Info points around the country to offer support to citizens in using digital services.

A computer equipment renting scheme, envisaged by the changes to the Promotion of Digital Inclusion Act, is to be introduced this year.",education,science and technology

Soldiers' trade unions want higher pay too,"The Defence Ministry Trade Union says in Wednesday's press release that the government has sent out a clear message that is not possible to eliminate in a democratic social dialogue the injustices suffered by employees of the Defence Ministry and Slovenian Armed Forces which stem from governments reaching partial agreements with individual professions, and that these can only be enforced through the announcement of protests or strikes.

The trade union thus expects a clear assurance from the prime minister that the pay disparities will be eliminated and the union's demands implemented.

These are a six-bracket rise in base pay for operators in notification centres, elimination of pay imbalances at the bottom of the pay scale, and re-establishment of pay ratios between uniformed staff and other professions.

""If we do not receive confirmation of a joint meeting by 20 January, we will start working on stepping up unionist activities in the defence sector in accordance with the legal restrictions, and go on strike,"" the union writes.

The joint press release with the Trade Union of Soldiers (SVS) meanwhile responds to claims that the pay of soldiers with completed secondary school is by an average 48% higher than that of assistant kindergarten teachers.

The two unions say that the analyses of public sector pay are misleading because they are not based on gross base pay but on the actual paid-out pay.

""The higher salaries of soldiers are merely a reflection of the shortage of soldiers and the burden of their overtime.""

Earlier this week, the government and the SVIZ trade union agreed to raise pay for assistant teachers at kindergartens by two brackets or by just over 8%.

The soldiers' unions believe that this ""humiliation"" could force soldiers to leave the army if their base pay does not immediately increase by at least four brackets.",labour,labour

Slovenians getting day off on 14 August to help with flood relief (adds),"He said that people would get a day off ""to help our acquaintance, neighbour, friend, everyone affected by the severe flooding"".

In a video address posted on his Instagram profile, Golob said that many initiatives and proposals had come from citizens in recent days in the face of the catastrophic floods. One of them was to declare 14 August a day off so that ""we can all show to those affected by the disaster that they are not alone"".

""So yes, the government decided that 14 August will be solidarity day. A day when the entire Slovenia will join forces and every one of us will contribute to the best of their abilities. I am convinced Slovenia can do that,"" Golob said.

Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GZS) expressed criticism, saying the day of solidarity would create additional cost for companies in other parts of the country.

Moreover, the flood-stricken companies that managed to repair the damage and were planning to relaunch will also be affected by the day off. It will raise their costs on top of the flood damage they already have to deal with.

The decision will also affect companies that called off collective leaves of absence in order to respond to high demand for their products, the GZS said. It believes it would be better if, instead of a day off, the government would order that a day's labour cost be donated for flood relief.

Making 14 August a work-free day means that Slovenians will have four days off between Friday and Tuesday, a bank holiday, when Christians observe the Assumption of Mary.

The massive floods that hit the country at the end of last week have been termed the worst natural disaster since independence. Two-thirds of the country have been devastated and many have lost their homes. Six people are thought to have been killed in the storms.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
Brussels approves Slovenia's EUR 20m state aid scheme for SMEs,"The scheme was approved on the basis of the framework, which was adopted by the Commission on 9 March this year to support measures in sectors that ate considered key in facilitating the green transition and reduction of fuel dependence.

The support under the scheme will be used for loans to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises affected by the energy crisis. The funds are available until 31 December, with the amount not exceeding EUR 2 million per beneficiary, the Commission said on Tuesday.

The capital injection to the Slovenian Enterprise Fund for this purpose was approved by the government in July. As announced at the time, the fund will be recapitalised with EUR 10 million this year, and with another EUR 10 million next year.

The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that beneficiaries have access to sufficient financial liquidity, which will encourage investments in energy efficiency.

It will enable small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain favourable loans at interest rates lower than in the market, with the possibility of an additional reduction in the rate if they carry out an energy audit, the Commission added.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Govt actively watching developments in Russia (adds),"""Through the operational group of the secretariat of the National Security Council, the government actively monitors the developments in Russia and is in contact with allied and partner countries,"" the government tweeted.

Benedejčič, state secretary in charge of national security, later told public broadcaster TV Slovenija that the National Security Council is active at several levels, with the operative group regularly meeting and informing the council.

""Of course, if there are considerable new developments in the coming hours or days, further possible steps will be thought through,"" Benedejčič, a former ambassador in Moscow, said.

President Nataša Pirc Musar also took to twitter, stressing that her office is carefully monitoring the situation in collaboration with other state institutions while being in touch with the allies.

""We must focus all our efforts on ensuring stability in Europe and the world. Slovenia is against any war. The EU must therefore remain firm in its efforts to uphold the rule of law and support Ukraine's territorial integrity,"" she write.

The Foreign Ministry and the Slovenian Embassy in Moscow are also ""watching the developments"", and told the STA that ever since Russia's attack on Ukraine Slovenian citizens have been advised against travelling to Russia.

Responding to an STA's query, the ministry said no Slovenian citizen has contacted them due to the latest developments.

Defence Minister Marjan Šarec also commented on the Wagner group mutiny, saying that it is Russia's internal affair and that Slovenia continues to support Ukraine.

Presidential runner-up Logar forms Cooperation Platform,"When Logar lost to Nataša Pirc Musar in the 13 November presidential run-off, he said that ""when one door closes, another one opens"" and that ""today we are at the beginning of something great"". His statement prompted many to speculate that he could form his own party, while he was rather tight-lipped about future plans.

Today he said that ""we're founding a platform through which we can seek and discuss changes, and present and put them forward. Let's leave the sofa zone of silent observation to start working together to create an open, relaxed Slovenia based on common sense.""

Inviting everyone who believes in cooperation to join in, Logar said the platform would provide an opportunity for everyone to present their opinion, put forward their proposals and become part of a convention on the future of Slovenia.

The platform will discus topics such as an encouraging business environment, modern technologies, AI, healthcare, youth, mental health, the judiciary, media and environment. ""There will be no taboo topics, but there will be competent speakers whose views will be brought together in a package of measures for Slovenia's future.""

The platform will aim to prepare concrete proposals based on a broad consensus and offer them to political parties. Should the ruling coalition reject them, it will show ""what it thinks about the opinion of experts and citizens, which will probably reflect in the election result later on.""

Asked whether he might form his own party by then, Logar told the press this would be an option should the association fail with their proposals.

He believes Slovenia is unable to make good use of its great potential, as administrative barriers often hinder creativity while ""the ideology explodes"" all too often.

It seems the status quo is being preserved to suit a minority at the expense of the majority, he said, adding the incumbent government has lost trust in a record time.

He disagrees with SDS leader Janez Janša that Slovenia is at the start of ""a civil war"", but the situation is hard and the government is not aware enough at what an important crossroads Slovenia is.

Romana Jordan, an SDS's ex-MEP who led Logar's election campaign team last year, was elected the association's vice president.

She sees the association as a step towards a more pluralistic society that will cherish a tolerant and respectful dialogue and one that will encourage diversity.

Apart from Logar and Jordan the founding members are also SDS MP Eva Irgl, economist Igor Masten, European law professor Matej Avbelj, ex-Digital Transformation Minister Mark Boris Andrijanič, doctor Rok Ravnikar and businessmen Igor Hustič and Mirko Požar.

Writer Mitja Čander, director of publisher Beletrina, is also among them alongside Alja Brglez, chief of staff at the office of former President Borut Pahor, and Jernej Pikalo, a former vice-president of the coalition Social Democrats (SD) who had served as education minister in two centre-left governments.

Pikalo, one of the names that prompted commentators to see Logar's association as bi-partisan, said the Platform's advantage is that it brings together members with different values.

In recent weeks, SDS leader Janez Janša said Logar's association was a welcome addition to the Slovenian political arena, but added he neither supported nor rejected the project.

In today's statement, Marko Balažic, leader of the non-parliamentary People's Party (SLS), said Logar's project was a generational opportunity to shift the mentality from unwillingness to cooperate with some towards the mentality of ""what we can do together"". Should Logar set up a party, Balažic would welcome it as competition.

New Slovenia, the opposition Christian democratic party, also hopes to work with Logar in the future. Its member Janez Pogorelec hopes that ""at some point, Logar will take over at the SDS, and then I'm almost certain that the right will win the elections"".",politics,politics

Employers forecast additional hiring for the second half of this year,"The latest employment forecast survey, published on Wednesday, shows a slightly higher growth projection compared to last autumn when employers predicted a 2.6% increase in employment for the first half of this year.

The survey, conducted in the spring and involving 3,146 employers from across the country, indicates the most promising employment prospects are in the construction sector (+7.8%), hospitality (+5.4%), real estate (+4.9%), and various other business segments (+4.4%).

The most sought profiles over the next six months will be heavy truck and tractor-trailer drivers, welders, salespeople, masons, workers for simple tasks in manufacturing, as well as cleaners, waiters, and household assistants in offices, hotels, and other establishments.

The largest employment growth is expected by employers in the Koper region (+3.7%), while above-average increases have also been forecast by employers from Ljubljana and Celje.

In the past six months, 55.8% of employers faced a shortage of suitable candidates for employment. Among large employers, this figure exceeded 80%. Employers in healthcare and social care, hospitality, transportation and warehousing, education, and construction sectors expressed the greatest concern.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Dnevnik says tree-cutting campaign in Ljubljana should have been better communicated,"Under the headline Did They Hope Nobody Will Notice?, the paper says that despite some information that was available about the campaign people realised how large-scale the campaign is only when they saw the almost completely depleted parts of the forest.

It was only when dozens of trees had already fallen that the authorities revealed that as many as 389 trees are slated for cutting.

Since they were not informed of what is going on, people created their opinion based on what they saw in the forest, especially since the tree cutting happened in an area where buildings stopped only a stone's throw away from the regional park.

It is no big surprise that rumours started that trees are being cut to make room for villas and Mayor Zoran Janković's denying this did not help silence them.

Considering how sensitive people are when a single tree is being cut and how popular the Rožnik Park is, it is hard to understand that the municipality did not expect such a strong reaction to the campaign, the paper says, adding that the project could have been much better communicated.

The fact is that ordinary people do not know how a forest is rejuvenated and why this is necessary, we do not know tree diseases. But we do know that every tree is precious, so rather than being patronising and avoiding a debate with citizens, the municipality should use such opportunities to promote the importance of trees in the ever hotter cities.",environmental issue,environmental issue

Foreign Minister Fajon starting visit to Vietnam and Indonesia,"The visits also comes as Slovenian business have expressed the wish to find new opportunities and to cooperate with the Indo-Pacific region, especially with Southeast Asia.

This is in line with the EU strategy for cooperation with the Indo-Pacific region, the ministry noted.

The visit to Vietnam and Indonesia will also be an opportunity to present Slovenia's bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2024 and 2025.

In the vote on 6 June, Slovenia will need a two-thirds majority of the votes cast by UN members to be elected from the Eastern European group, with Belarus competing for the same seat, the ministry noted.

Accompanied by a business delegation, Fajon will visit on Sunday and Monday Ho Chi Minh City, the business centre of Vietnam, where she will open a Slovenian-Vietnamese business forum and meet the mayor of the city.

The foreign minister will also be a guest at a meeting of young women entrepreneurs.

Fajon will then travel to the capital Hanoi, where she will meet her counterpart Bui Thanh Son, Industry and Trade Minister Nguyen Hong Dien and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday. A business event will also be hosted as part of the visit.

On Wednesday, the foreign minister will visit Indonesia, where she will meet in the capital of Jakarta her counterpart Retno Marsudi, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn and Arsjad Rasjid, the chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.","economy, business and finance",politics
Freediver Alenka Artnik breaks another world record,"The 41-year-old from the port city of Koper dived 107 metres on the third day of the competition to break personal and national records only to dive two metres deeper three days later to become the world-record holder.

""Who runs the world?! Women,"" the organisers of the competition wrote on their website. Artnik added that ""the dive went exactly as I always want it to. That's not always easy. I feel the whole universe was supporting me today and the result has come"".

Artnik has been a freediver for just over a decade and has set a number of milestones, including in 2017 when she became the fourth women ever to dive 100 metres deep.

She is considered one of the greatest freedivers ever, and set world records six times between 2018 and 2021; until recently she was a record-holder in monofin with 122 metres, set in 2021.

Last November, she received the Golden Order of Merit from the Slovenian president for her outstanding sporting achievements. ""When I get a recognition like this, it provides me with additional motivation and energy,"" she told the STA at the time.",sport,sport
"Tagging of food couriers suspended, report says","Since last week food couriers in the capital no longer have to wear identification numbers, a measure that was introduced to facilitate reporting their potential traffic violations amid the growing number of citizens' complaints.

Tagging has been suspended until the Information Commissioner wraps up the procedure to establish whether the identification numbers are in accordance with provisions on the protection of personal data, Wolt and Glovo representatives told the newspaper.

As tagging was launched, the Ljubljana municipality said the measure would help improve traffic safety in city centre, but the Labour Ministry and the Mladi Plus youth trade union have been very critical of the move.

The latter said in August 2022 that the local authorities and the gig economy companies wanted to place the blame and responsibility for traffic violations on the couriers instead of taking responsibility for creating the conditions that forced them to violate traffic rules in the first place.

According to Dnevnik's unofficial information, the procedure against Wolt Tehnologije and Glovoapp SI was initiated by the Information Commissioner, whose office told the newspaper that it was conducting two separate proceedings against the companies, but would not disclose further information as the proceedings are ongoing.

Responding to the latest developments, the municipality, which imposed tagging in agreement with Wolt and Glovo, said that it had been informed about the suspension and that no alternative measures were being considered for now.",social issue,social issue
Foreign minister starts two-day visit to Tanzania,"New opportunities for cooperation between the countries will be formed as part of the visit, particularly in the fields of energy, technology, water management, green economy and food security, the ministry wrote.

Fajon will present to the Tanzanian minister the international conference Africa Day, hosted by Slovenia every year, that will take place in April and focus on food security.

Fajon has just finished a three-day visit to Ethiopia garnering support for Slovenia's candidacy for the Security Council and strengthening cooperation.

The support of African countries will be key in Slovenia's bid for a seat in the Security Council, so senior officials are travelling to Africa to get endorsement. Last week State Secretary Samuel Žbogar visited Namibia and Botswana and National Assembly President Urška Klakočar Zupančič visited Rwanda and Uganda.

The elections will take place on 6 June. Competing against Belarus, Slovenia needs 129 votes to be elected. Fajon is staying moderately optimistic, she said some days ago in Brussels.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Treasury: Pay rise deals not jeopardising fiscal stability (adds),"The financial effect of the EUR 600 gross in monthly bonus promised to judges and prosecutors is estimated at EUR 9.1 million annually, the ministry said on Thursday in response to the STA's questions.

The ministry described the bonus as a temporary measure, to be in force until the public sector pay system has been reformed. The funds will be secured through budget redistribution, it said.

The impact of the planned increase in salaries of kindergarten assistant teachers by four brackets and a pay rise for junior researchers is EUR 18 million in 2023, according to the ministry.

The ministry said the deal with the doctors' union Fides would have no financial consequences. Doctors' demands are to be resolved in a separate pay tier for healthcare which is to come into effect by next year.

""We would like to emphasise that the changes adopted do not jeopardise the sustainability of public finances,"" the ministry said.

Among those raising concerns about the latest pay rise deals was Davorin Kračun, the head of the Fiscal Council, who told the commercial broadcaster POP TV the public sector wage bill was EUR 5.5 billion or 11% of GDP.

""This means that each percentage of the rise in those wages accounts for EUR 50 million in additional borrowing,"" Kračun said.

""We're talking about irresponsible distribution of money that is in fact non-existing,"" Maks Tajnikar, the dean of the Ljubljana School of Business and Economics, told the newspaper Delo.

According to the Public Administration Ministry, the recent agreements stem from the promises given to the public sector by the previous government.

The incumbent government had obligated itself to honour these deals ""in the light of respect for the rule of law"", the ministry said.

It expressed surprise that the trade unions that have also brokered deals with the government in the past are talking about industrial action now that the government is set to implement valid deals.

Moreover, the government will in the coming days adopt pay system reform guidelines for talks with trade unions. Simultaneously talks will be launched on eliminating pay disparities, to wrap up by the end of June.

The ministry also touched on bonuses promised to judges and prosecutors, saying their salaries had actually decreased in real terms since 2015, while those of other public sector employees increased.

The salaries of prosecutors dropped by 11% and those of judges by 4.9%, while public sectors employees' salaries rose by 12.8%, the Public Administration Ministry said.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"

Meanwhile, gross operating profit (EBITDA) increased by 8.1% to EUR 2.53 million, according to the unaudited results.

The Funds from Operations (FFO), which the company said is the most widely monitored indicator of the performance of real estate companies, reached EUR 2.86 million in the first half of the year, compared to EUR 2.38 million in the same period last year.

The company generates income mainly from renting out properties and charging tenants for expenses.

Delo says battle of Bakhmut is human slaughterhouse,"Starting nine months ago, the battle of Bakhmut is the longest and the most brutal battle of the Ukraine war. Tens of thousands of soldiers died on both sides, the paper says under the headline Human Slaughterhouse With No Strategic Value.

The battle of Bakhmut has become a national legend in Ukraine. As graves are being dug for soldiers across Ukraine, poems are being written about the battle of Bakhmut. But the battle is a slaughterhouse killing off hundreds of young Ukrainian lives at an increasing speed.

Things have become especially bad in the past weeks, as the Russian mercenary army Wagner has been sending into death in human waves thousands of Russian prisoners it recruited, and strengthened its grip in the city.

At the moment, Bakhmut is a symbol of rebellion, but a symbol of what will it be a few years from now? Fighting for survival in WWII-style trenches, Ukrainian soldiers are running out of ammunition, and the most recent reports show that some units had withdrawn from the area.

Kyiv has been defending Bakhmut with the intention tiring out the Russian military and to relieve pressure on other battlefields. It was also a delay tactics, as Ukraine was waiting for a new weapons shipment from the West, which would allow a new offensive in the spring. But this seems impossible at the moment, given the losses and the exhaustion.

For Kremlin, however, it is imperative that Russia wins the battle. Putin desperately needs a victory, even one without a strategic value, to sell it to the people as a new battle of Stalingrad or Kursk. For the attackers, people in the battle of Bakhmut are merely biomass to burn through.","unrest, conflicts and war","unrest, conflicts and war"
Paper says administrative units reform should start with simpler laws,"Despite the ministry rejecting the news that out of a total of 58 units around the country only 12 will be kept, it has earned itself heavy criticism.

The opposition SDS and NSi said such a reform is another step towards centralisation and yet another sign the Golob government is out of touch with reality, but it was also criticised by the coalition SocDems and several mayors.

Despite the outcry, there is little information about what the ministry wants to achieve apart from addressing the shortage of staff and overload at certain units.

The main guideline seems to be one administrative unit taking over the more demanding cases for a whole region at the centre of that region.

The ministry has promised to reveal more details in the autumn, but the impression is it does not really know how to carry out the planned reorganisation.

Staff at administrative units and users of their services believe that the ministry should address unfriendly, complicated and often absurd legislation that sometimes makes procedures at administrative units unreasonably long, concludes the commentary They Should Start at the Bottom of Things.",social issue,social issue
Kralj awarded posthumous Kresnik Prize for novel of the year,"A mix of fiction and fact, Ne Bom Se Več Drsal na Bajerju (I'm Not Skating on the Pond Anymore) is the second novel by Kralj and was published just before he died.

The Second World War is one of the most often fictionalised periods and therefore one of the most demanding topics. Kralj does not attempt to tell a big story, he focuses on a specific local level, gliding along a thin line between fact and fiction, the jury said.

""The novel is the embodiment of the maxim that to get to the universal, one must start with the particular,"" jury chair Igor Bratož, a culture writer for Delo newspaper, said at Friday's award ceremony.

Kralj was the only male author shortlished for the EUR 7,000 prize, which is considered the most prestigious prize for novels in Slovenia.

The other shortlisted authors were Katja Gorečan, Katarina Marinčič, Dijana Matković and Tina Vrščaj.

The winner was selected in an hour-long conclave on Rožnik Hill in Ljubljana, whereupon a bonfire was lit in honour of the winner.

The Kresnik Prize is named after a pagan mythological being that appears when the Sun shines the strongest.

""The traditional bonfire flame has always and from the very start burnt in honour of the Slovenian novel, its media impact, its authors, but most fervently illuminating the path to the book for readers,"" Delo has said about the prize introduced in 1991.

The Kresnik was first handed out on 23 June 1991, and last year it went to Roman Rozina for Sto Let Slepote (Hundred Years of Blindness), a 20th-century historical novel focussing on a coal mining family.",sport,social issue
Law passed to make mortgages more accessible,"Amendments to the macro-prudential supervision of the financial system act will allow the central bank to adjust lending restrictions independently of the enforcement and security act.

The latter law provides that essential living expenses equal 76% of the minimum wage, which means borrowers need to have such amount of money left on their account when they pay off their monthly loan instalment.

Every time the minimum wage rose, the required amount of credit left on the borrowers' bank account after paying their loan obligations increased accordingly, which in turn affected their eligibility to borrow.

Under the amendments passed today, the central bank will no longer be obliged to follow that rule but will be able to set another benchmark for assessing the amount that should be left to the borrower on a monthly basis. One possible measure is an assessment of essential living expenses.

The government put forward the amendments after the statutory minimum wage rose from EUR 1,074 to EUR 1,203 gross or from EUR 778 to EUR 878 net in January. The amount the borrower is required to have left on their account after settling their monthly loan instalments thus rose from EUR 817 to EUR 915.

This impacted the creditworthiness of borrowers whose earnings range from minimum to average.

The amendments merely tackle ambiguities regarding the central bank's obligation to follow provisions of the enforcement and security act, Nikolina Prah from the Finance Ministry told MPs.

They do not affect the position of the borrower in case of enforcement for failure to pay credit obligations, she added.

Nor does the act interfere in the central bank's powers. The regulator will still take such macro-prudential measures as it deems fit for the Slovenian banking system, the indebtedness of the population and the broader financial stability.

The amendments were carried unanimously by 77 votes. All deputy factions supported the idea that borrowing should be made more accessible to households.

""We hope that the banking regulator will act sensibly and also give people on lower incomes a fair assessment of their creditworthiness,"" SocDem MP Soniboj Knežak said.

""The law is well-intentioned,"" said Jernej Vrtovec of the opposition party New Slovenia (NSi). Under the current regime, which has been in force since 2019, young people in particular cannot take out a mortgage to buy a home, so they are forced to rent, for which they may pay more per month than the loan instalment would be, he said.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
First funds for just transition of coal regions available in March,"Sofia Alves from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy said that coal regions were faced with great challenges in their transition to climate neutrality. The Just Transition Fund was set up to address these issues, she said at the conference in Velenje.

Velenje Mayor Peter Dermol thinks the time has come for a new mindset. If the much needed trust is created among the people, the restructuring will be much easier, he said.

The Savinjsko-Saleška region is ready for the transition but needs support from the state and the European Commission in finding solutions to the many challenges, the mayor said.

First, the main projects need to be identified and then additional financial sources found in the coming years as the current budget will not be enough. Good projects will have to backed, he said.

The municipality presented its key projects of regional importance that are meant to help create a new city of Velenje. They include transforming the old city power station into an industrial and educational centre of the future, a generator of human resources, innovation and renewables.

A new 5,000-square-metre industrial and technological park in the city's business district is to help keep the rapid growing technological companies in the region and attract new ones.

Today's conference hosted by the regional development agency in cooperation with local communities was attended by a delegation from the European Commission confirming the 2021-2027 cohesion policy, under which EUR 3.2 billion will be available to Slovenia.

A ceremony marking the confirmation of the programme will be held in Ljubljana this evening with Alves, Development Minister Aleksander Jevšek and European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič as keynote speakers.","economy, business and finance","crime, law and justice"

Govt grilling debate wraps up without conclusions,"Summing up the interpellation debate called by his Democratic Party (SDS), Janša said it showed the prime minister said one thing and the ministers another, but he hoped the debate brought the government and the coalition together, held up a mirror to them and sobered them up ""so that they stop causing confusion"".

""Any constructive criticism is good for the government because they can then correct their actions,"" the former prime minister said, announcing that the SDS would continue to support good proposals and oppose those they considered harmful to the country, if need be with referendums.

He made a prediction that the government would not complete its term. ""It's not a given that when this government falls, there will be a snap election,"" he said.

""I believe those who have followed this debate today have been able to see definitely what the difference is between the bloc that had been in power before 24 April last year and the current government,"" Prime Minister Robert Golob said referring to the general election last year in which his party won an overwhelming plurality of votes.

He said the former government, led by Janša, lived in the past, while his was ""facing reality"". Golob said his government insisted on respectful and open dialogue with everyone, including those who might not share their opinion.

As a demonstration of that he said that in recent weeks he had met with farmer representatives, who subsequently walked out of negotiations this week, and today, on the sidelines of the interpellation, he met with Pavle Rupar, a former SDS MP who heads the group that has been staging pensioners' protests in front of the parliament building.

""The dialogue was brief, but it always starts somewhere,"" Golob said, adding it was through dialogue that better solutions could be arrived at.

In presenting the arguments for the interpellation, Janša said at the beginning of the government's term ""there were great words about reforms, but after almost a year, all that is left on the table is a reform of timetables"".

He reproached the government for starting its work by abolishing the Demographic Affairs Office and the Museum of Slovenian Independence, both of which were formed by the Janša government. The museum's merger with the Museum of Recent History was the main reason for the interpellation.

Apart from accusing the government of failing to deliver on its reform promises in particular those pertaining to healthcare and taxes, Janša also accused the government of reversing measures aimed at decentralisation, of staffing purges and of pressuring the Constitutional Court.

Janša also talked about the importance of independence, assessing that Slovenia was going through a crisis of values.

Golob welcomed the debate as an opportunity to present the work of his government in a truthful way, which, in Golob's words, had been withheld from people because ""some media had been captured and because some keep misleading and scaremongering"".

He argued that 60% of the text in the SDS's motion against the government was dedicated to the Museum of Slovenian Independence and 2% to what people were struggling with the most, healthcare, which he said told a lot about the SDS's priorities.

He also accused the SDS of blocking the work of parliament and the government at the start of the term by filing bills and referendum initiatives.

As proof of the government's successful track record, he listed a range of data, including electricity, oil and petrol prices, inflation and unemployment figures, as well as decisions concerning taxes and healthcare.

He began by thanking the SDS and Janša, for reminding the people of ""all of those things they said no to a year ago"".

The debate saw opposition MPs lambaste the government for its job. The SDS initially announced it would put forward conclusions urging the government to tackle what it described as unlawful and unconstitutional conduct and decisions, but failed to table them in the end.

The opposition party New Slovenia (NSi) accused the government of waging a culture war, and of failing to implement health reform. The party suggested the SDS present conclusions with their motion, arguing it should have some kind of a ""vote outcome"".

The ruling coalition parties rejected all the accusations levelled against the government, arguing the government was successful and trustworthy. They accused the SDS of abusing the institute of interpellation.

Golob's Freedom Movement argued that the government had proved with measures taken so far in healthcare it was not just paying lip service but would implement reform.

Luka Mesec, the leader of the Left said the interpellation, ""containing 14 pages about cultural Marxism, single-party totalitarian regimes, liquidations and similar bogeymen"", was merely about demonising the government and causing unrest, while SocDem leader Tanja Fajon added there were no major conflicts within the government.

During the debate several hundred people gathered outside the parliament building to protest against the scarping of the Museum of Slovenian Independence as an independent institution. The protest was called by the right-leaning Association for the Values of Independence.

The protesters, which were joined by SDS and NSi leaders, supported the interpellation and the NSi' recommendations to the government to enhance Slovenian independence values.",politics,politics
Delo warns against Germany being stuck in its Ostpolitik,"The paper points to the words of Lars Klingbeil, head of the senior coalition SPD, revealing that Berlin had so far not allowed even the slightest possibility of its policy towards Russia going sour.

The only scenario that Germany's long-term foreign policy strategy envisaged is Russia transforming into a liberal democracy and abandoning all imperial aspirations.

Declassified government documents have shown that government officials were acquainted with risks but given the country's dependence on Russian gas, the warnings were simply overheard. And the price for this blindness is horrific, Delo says.

""This is why we should be careful when calling for Germany to take over the leading role in the European and global politics ... Who can guarantee that it will not be as strategically blind in the future as it has been so far?""

Given its size and economy, the country should be promoting the interests of liberal democracies and international law in the world more actively, and also take on greater defence responsibility.

When Klingbeil says Germany will have to reform everything from diplomacy to army the question that arises is how under-nurtured these systems are in Germany and how quickly can they change their whole modus operandi.

""If Berlin did not want to hear warnings about the danger of energy dependence on Russia is it ready to hear warnings that Putin will not stop in Ukraine?"" the paper wonders under the headline Trapped in the Ruins of Ostpolitik.",politics,politics
Večer: Golob and Plenković swept problems under the rug,"After Prime Minister Golob's first official visit to Croatia, it is clear that border arbitration remains where it has been: irrevocably accepted in Slovenia, irreversibly rejected in Croatia. ""And most importantly, it is not implemented and god knows when it will be,"" says the commentary Arbitrary Rhetoric.

As for migrations, the paper says that Plenković remains loath to host Frontex forces despite a tripling of illegal migrants and even through the foreign ministers of Slovenia, Croatia and Italy advocated stronger border checks at a meeting in Italy earlier this week.

""The prime ministers indulged in a bit of a sweeping under the rug, but for a higher cause - focusing on the way forward. This is not necessarily bad. Businesses are already showing the way with booming bilateral trade.""",politics,politics
Win over Italy enough for 7th place at World Cup,"This is as high as the team has ever climbed at the World Cup and the same result as in Spain in 2014.

NBA star Luka Dončić was once again the top scorer with 29 points, which brings his average at this World Cup to 27, likely making him the best scorer of the tournament.

He is also the first player in 30 years to have scored more than 200 points, 50 tournaments and 40 assists at the World Cup.

The team leave the tournament slightly disappointed as the aim was to reach the semi-finals.

""True, we did have higher goals and have a bitter aftertaste after the defeat against Canada, but for a country of two million people seventh place is quite an achievement,"" Zoran Dragić said.

"Shows for minorities struggling with staff, finance","At the event hosted by the Institute for Ethnic Studies, Saša Banjanac Lubej, the editor and presenter of the TV Slovenija show NaGlas! for ethnic communities that hail from former Yugoslav states, spoke about the issues faced by the show.

Banjanac Lubej said that the recent decision by the management of the public broadcaster to terminate cooperation with freelance journalists of the show had left her as the only remaining contributor as of the end of March.

According to her, the decision means that the show for the Albanian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Croatian, Macedonian and Serbian communities in Slovenia is being cancelled in the form it was conceived eight years ago.

""Although limited, the show is still on the air but it cannot fulfil the conceived vision,"" Banjanac Lubej said, noting that the added value of the dismissed freelance journalists was that they spoke the languages of these respective communities.

Sandi Horvat, the editor of shows for the Roma community at RTV Slovenija, said he faced similar challenges, especially regarding the radio show, where he is the only employee and many times he has to prepare and host the show on his own.

Damian Fischer, who is a contributor and editor of the Koper-Capodistria Regional RTV Centre and a member of the RTV programme committee for the Italian minority, noted that the team had to cover multiple areas of work.

Fischer, who currently edits the prime time news show twice a week and a special 20-minute current affairs show on Fridays, highlighted the shortage of staff and finances as the largest issue.

""It is difficult to develop our culture because of the financial issue, but we work because our mission is to inform,"" he said.

Young people are interested in working as a journalist, but the problem for most of them is that they have to know Italian and Slovenian, and sometimes also Croatian. It is difficult to find someone with all these skills, he added.

Sandor Kovacs, a long-time contributor for the Hungarian radio station in Pomurje, said that the station could use a few more employees to function normally. ""In Ljubljana, three people perform the work that is done here by one person.""

The participants also noted that, in order to reach young generations, the minority media have created communication channels on the internet and social networks because ""there is no future in the long run without this"".

There were also calls to Slovenian counterparts from the mainstream media to more frequently cover minority-related topics and issues.",social issue,social issue
This year's regular pension rise to amount to 5.2% (adds),"The lowest pension will thus stand at EUR 310 net, guaranteed pension (for full years of service) at EUR 688 and the lowest disability pension at EUR 431.

Over EUR 330 million annually has been earmarked for the regular pension rise, which pensioners will get at the end of February, including the back rise for January.

Under pension legislation, a regular indexation is carried out once a year based on the growth in average monthly gross wages and consumer prices in the previous year.

Wage growth, which reached 2.8% in 2022, accounts for 60% of the rise and consumer prices, which rose by 8.8%, for 40%, which translates into a 5.2% rise, said Andraž Rangus from ZPIZ.

The council also agreed with a proposal from two pensioner organisations for an emergency pension rise due to high inflation and the cost of living crisis.

Based on the proposal of the Pensioners' Association (ZDUS) and Trade Union of Pensioners (SUS), ZPIZ will prepare two pension rise variants.

Under this scenario, pensions are to rise after 1 April. One possible rise is 3.5% and another 4%, but in either case, those who retired before 2011 will get another 1%.

ZPIZ director general Marijan Papež is in favour of this year's regular and emergency increases, but fears the emergency rise could make the pension budget unsustainable.

A similar issue was raised by Franci Klužer, the government's representative on the council, but Andrej Zorko, who represents trade unions, said the pension budget had had constantly a surplus until the employers' contributions had been cut in the 1990s. The contributions paid by workers have meanwhile remained the same.

""How can the state talk about sustainability of the pension budget if it itself caused its unsustainability and thus jeopardised its stability,"" he wondered.

The Ministry of Labour, the Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities meanwhile said it is aware of the hardships of many pensioners, which it wants to address as part of a pension reform.

The ZPIZ council also discussed an opposition SDS-sponsored bill to enable employers to keep the workers for a full 40-hour week also after their retirement.

These workers would receive a full pension, but ZPIZ is not in favour of partial solutions, and urged the government to draft a comprehensive pension reform.",labour,labour
Boštjan Poklukar appointed interior minister (adds),"After being elected, Poklukar said he was confident he would do a good job at the ministry until the end of the term. He declined to reveal his team yet and to say whether there will be any changes at the helm of the police force.

""Every change at the top entails certain changes,"" he said, reiterating that his priorities would be fight against corruption, managing migrations, and the depoliticisation, professionalisation and modernisation of the police.

He would thus not reveal whether acting Police Commissioner Boštjan Lindav will stay on after former Minister Tatjana Bobnar failed with her proposal for the government to appoint Lindav for a full term in early December. Poklukar will meet Lindav today.

The new minister stressed that police commissioner was independent. ""But the interior minister is the one who gives tasks to police with regular and extraordinary guidelines,"" Poklukar said.

Having experience in disaster relief and protection, armed forces and interior affairs, Poklukar is familiar with these fields, which means he will have no problem introducing the ""right ways"" in these systems, Golob told MPs.

He highlighted his three priorities - fight against corruption, managing migration and depoliticisation of police - would mark not only the work of the police and the Interior Ministry but the entire country.

Poklukar has set fight against corruption as his top priority, with Golob saying this was the priority of the entire government.

Corruption is on the rise in Slovenia and the country has been losing spots in corruption perception indexes, he noted. ""We must put an end to this,"" he said, announcing changes to the criminal legislation and a judicial reform if necessary.

Turning to migration, Golob said the removal of the fence on the Slovenian-Croatian border would continue. ""It's also clear that since Croatia's entry into the Schengen Area we must strengthen control at the Schengen outer border. Slovenia will actively participate in this, helping Croatia make oversight over its Schengen border more efficient,"" he said.

As for Poklukar's plans for depoliticising the police, Golob said Poklukar was very much aware of the fact that being a minister was a political office and that he was also aware of the division between the police, the police directorate and the minister.

""I believe that the misunderstandings we have been seeing in these relations in the past year are a thing of the past, because Poklukar is aware of the fact that he is a political official and is aware of the boundaries, which he cannot cross in relation to police,"" Golob said.

Also planned is professionalisation of the police, which will include a new system of promotions. ""The funds to actually finally modernise the police have been set aside in the national budgets for this year and the next and Poklukar will implement this modernisation,"" Golob said.

The deputy groups of the coalition Freedom Movement, Left and the Social Democrats (SD) backed Poklukar unanimously, saying he was an experienced candidate who was aware of his responsibilities.

The SDS and NSi questioned Poklukar's professionalism and independence. SDS MP Branko Grims objected to the ongoig removal of the border fence, noting that the number of migrations doubled in the past year compared to the year before, so the country's security might be at risk.

Grims is also concerned how motivated Poklukar will be for investigating the most complex crimes and whether he will cooperate with other Balkan countries to investigate energy company Gen-I's money withdrawals and transactions in Albania, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.

SDS leader Janez Janša labelled Poklukar as ""a poor staffing proposal that is even below the average of the current government"" at today's press conference dedicated to Ukraine.

Vida Čadonič Špelič from the NSi deputy group said the public had still not received a convincing explanation as to why Poklukar's predecessor Bobnar had to step down.

She said the NSi was worried that the announced depoliticisation and professionalisation of the police would in fact lead to politicians entering police, especially the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), and ""have control over individual procedures"".

Poklukar rejected these accusations, saying no minister was efficient enough for the opposition.

Poklukar is now taking over from Public Administration Minister Sanja Ajanović Hovnik, who has temporarily run the ministry.","crime, law and justice","crime, law and justice"
Atlantic Grupa inaugurates its biggest solar plant in Rogaška Slatina,"Slovenian Minister of the Environment and Energy Bojan Kumer said on the occasion that investment in renewable electricity is the right way to decarbonisation.

He welcomed investment by businesses into sustainable operations, saying that a major shift towards renewables is what will take us on the path of green transition.

Last year, the energy crisis led the government to increase investments in the electricity distribution centre and a few months ago, through a public call for tenders, EUR 80 million from the recovery and resilience plan was made available in grants to reinforce the voltage level of the distribution networks.

The new electricity plant, Atlantic Grupa's biggest, will produce 31% of all electricity the Rogaška Slatina facility needs, thus reducing dependency on external sources, optimising costs and contributing to environmental protection, said Smrekar.

At the same location there will be two solar-powered filling stations for electric vehicles, he said, adding that sustainability has been an important part of Atlantic Grupa's business strategy for more than a decade.

Asked why the mineral water Donat is not bottled in glass bottles, Smrekar said they are heavy, which raises the cost of transport and emissions. And when the bottles are returned, a lot of water is used to wash them, so Atlantic Grupa decided on recyclable plastic bottles.

Atlantic Grupa executive director Darja Teržan said this year marks 115 years since the Donat magnesium-rich mineral water spring was discovered in Rogaška Slatina.

Production director Dušan Lorenčič said the soft drinks plant, which opened in 1972, has 73 workers and produces Donat, Cockta and Cedevita in three shifts five days a week. 50 million litres were produced last year, and the plan for this year is 60 million. Since its capacity is at only 75%, they are considering producing new drinks here.",environmental issue,environmental issue
Slovenian rescue team returning from Turkey,"The team of seven rescue dogs, their handlers and four assistants was deployed to Turkey on Tuesday, under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, in the wake of one of the deadliest earthquakes in decades that rocked Turkey and Syria on Monday.

The team joined the rescue effort on the ground on Wednesday to comb through the rubble in search of life.

It will return home today in cooperation with the Slovenian army.

Blaž Turk, the head of the team, said that the work had been very demanding. The team was highly motivated throughout their time in Turkey and even the dogs' injuries did not dampen their motivation, he said as quoted by the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.

The administration said that one of the seven dogs had not been able to take part in the rescue effort yesterday, adding that the dog's wound had been treated.

It also posted a video on Twitter in which one of the handlers said there was confusion as to which facilities had already been checked by dogs, so they were in contact with local representatives to make sure they were searching for signs of life in the right places.

The debris makes it very difficult to drive on the roads, which are impassable, so even a short journey in the same street can take half an hour, he said, adding that they would soon hit the 100th hour of the effort, meaning that time was slowly running out for rescuers.

He said there was still hope of finding survivors, ""but there is more and more of the smell of dead bodies buried in the rubble, which is quite stressful for us as well as the dogs.""

Earlier this week, the administration said they were expected to stay in Turkey for four or five days, as exhaustion usually set in after such a period.

Many international search teams are gradually withdrawing from the affected areas due to the deteriorating security situation, injuries and exhaustion, the ministry said in a press release.

A number of Slovenian relief and charity organisations, including Unicef Slovenia, the Slovenian Red Cross and Caritas, have launched donation campaigns to help people in the affected areas in Turkey and Syria. They opened dedicated accounts and donations are also possible via text messages.

Caritas Slovenia has so far raised more than EUR 120,000, the organisation said today as it called for additional support.

Touching on the rest of the additional funds, the minister mentioned around half a million euros for implementation of projects co-funded by the EU Integrated Border Management Fund.

""These projects are a part of the new financial perspective, which are only now being prepared due to a delayed start. Funding is expected as of the second quarter,"" said the minister.

Večer comments on chaotic situation in healthcare,"The state or the impression of general chaos is in the interest of those who know how to use such smoke screens to their benefit, the newspaper says under the headline Robert Golob's New Year.

Ratings of government ministers and the ruling Freedom Movement have dropped, with Health Minister Danijel Bešič Loredan being the barometer of the state of the government.

Conflicts in healthcare are a result of decades' long negligence toward the health system, which is under the attack of privatisation and inability/unwillingness to reform it.

But Prime Minister Golob had been aware of Bešič Loredan's political (un)suitability, given that he is seen as a political appendix of private healthcare's No. 1 Marko Bitenc.

While health ministers should be stable political heavyweights, Bešič Loradan's credibility has recently been further undermined by Golob himself.

He first made Bešič Loredan apologise to ""his majesty"" the Ljubljana mayor for alleging that the mayor wanted to sell two health centres.

Then he went to the patients' protest rally on Tuesday after Bešič Loredan labelled it as ""extremism"".

Bešič Loredan meanwhile reached a deal with the Fides trade union averting Wednesday's strike, but who knows how long the truce with doctors will last.

Doctors have triggered a wave of higher pay demands, which Golob enhanced with a promise of a bonus for judges, triggering a wave of similar demands.

New fronts are opening for the government, but to a large extent, only old problems are being solved, so the question is how and when the government will start addressing the strategic challenges it pledged to tackle when winning the election - demography, housing, and more investments after the collapse of a business model based on cheap Russian energy.",health,health
Govt adopts bill to boost air connectivity with new subsidies,"The move comes after the state already provided air connectivity schemes involving subsidies for airlines in 2021 and 2022. Bratušek, scheduled to become minister, spoke during her confirmation meeting earlier in the day of an emergency bill that would enable the subsidising of passengers as opposed to airlines.

The legislation was drawn up jointly by the Economy Ministry and the Infrastructure Ministry, which Bratušek said would also determine together a list of destinations to be included in the scheme on the basis of their significance for Slovenia.

""Our financial estimate is EUR 5.6 million per year, based on the assumption that we will secure ten daily connections for about 255 days of the year,"" Bratušek told the press after the government's session. She added the estimate was also based on the assumption that there would be between 120 and 130 passengers on board.

Given that the scheme constitutes state aid, an approval is needed from the European Commission. ""We have already forwarded the bill to it. We are acting fast because we want to get there before the summer season, which already starts at the end of March,"" Bratušek added.

Economy Minister Matjaž Han agreed the bill was important. ""We have secured a source of funding for air links in Slovenia for a period of three years,"" he said.

Better connectivity is vital for Slovenia to be well integrated into global currents, Han said. ""Slovenia is an export-oriented economy, we have quality tourism and therefore we need good air connections,"" he added.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Celje hospital tightens security after assault by patient,"Dragan Kovačić, the acting director of the Celje General Hospital, said that the patient, who was not seriously ill, injured the arm of one staff member, who then suffered a heart attack, and broke the nose of the other by head-butting them.

Slovenia's economy expanded by 5.4% in 2022 (adds),"Last year's growth was driven by final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation, while external trade had a negative impact because imports grew at a faster rate than exports. The external trade surplus amounted to EUR 961 million in 2022, which compares to EUR 3.31 billion the year before.

Seasonally adjusted GDP, a gauge used in an EU-wide comparison, increased by 5.7% in 2022. It rose by 1.3% in the final quarter year-on-year and increased by 0.8% compared to the quarter before.

In terms of quarter-on-quarter comparison, GDP contracted only in the third quarter last year, by 1.3% from the previous quarter.

Growth slowed in the second half of the year. According to fresh data, GDP surged at an annual rate of 10.2% in real terms in the first quarter before growth eased to 8.6% in the second quarter and then slowed to 3.3% in the third quarter and 0.2% in the fourth quarter, but quarterly growth was recorded.

In the final quarter, domestic expenditure increased by 1.2% year-on-year; household consumption expenditure rose by 2.6% and gross fixed capital formation increased by 5.9%.

In that quarter, both exports and imports contracted year-on-year in what was the first decrease since the final quarter of 2020. Exports decreased by 2.5% and imports by 1.5%. The contribution of external trade balance to GDP growth was negative, at 0.9 of a percentage point.

Changes in inventories also had a negative impact on GDP growth.

Total value added increased by 1.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

Construction, and professional, scientific, technical, administrative and support services contributed the most to the total value added. The most prominent decline, at a rate of 6.3%, was recorded in joint activities of mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and water supply. For these activities, this was the first decrease in two years.

Employment kept increasing in the final quarter of the year, but at a slower pace. Year-on-year it increased by 1.6% to 1,083,800 people. Most new jobs were created in construction and in manufacturing.

Commenting on the figures, the Slovenian central bank said it had expected a continued robust post-pandemic growth in 2022, considering the strong support by the monetary and fiscal policies.

""After exceptionally favourable trends in the first half of the year, economic activity started slowing in the third quarter but growth accelerated in the final quarter,"" Banka Slovenije said.

""Such an outcome is an encouraging signal for this year when growth will slow down,"" the central bank said. Most institutions find that households and businesses show a high level of resilience, which ""will contribute to positive economic growth in this year as well"".

Meanwhile, the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, the government's economic forecaster, assessed that last year's growth exceeded the expectations.

This, it said, reflected households' resilience and the effect of energy crisis mitigation measures.

Investments in capital goods increased by 7.8% last year and households' expenditure went up by 9.1%, which is just below the 2021 rate.

This is attributed to the lifting of Covid restrictions at the beginning of the year, further increase in employment and until mid-2022 redemption of vouchers designed to help the services sector.

IMAD director Maja Bednaš noted that household expenditure slowed down in the second half of the year due to a loss of consumer trust and the falling purchasing power in the face of the cost-of-living crisis.

""The government measures to mitigate the Covid crisis in the spring and the cost-of-living in the autumn prevented an even stronger real decline in the average disposable income,"" she added.

Like in the third quarter, government expenditure in the fourth quarter dropped year-on-year mainly because of the much lower expenditure related to Covid-19 management measures. Employment growth in the government sector also slowed.

IMAD noted that confidence indicators remain at low levels at the beginning of the year, but also more optimism in the euro zone and more upbeat forecasts by the IMF and the European Commission. The latter expects for Slovenia to post a 1% growth this year.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Cycling ace Primož Roglič signs for German team Bora-Hansgrohe (adds),"The transfer was announced by Ralph Denk, the head of the Bora-Hansgrohe team, who said at a press conference on Friday that Roglič would be joining the team for the coming seasons.

The Slovenian has signed more than a one-year contract, but Denk did not reveal any details about its duration and worth.

He assessed that in Roglič, the team has acquired one of the largest contenders for the win in the main race of the season, the Tour de France.

""My wish is for that team to win the Tour,"" added the head of the team who had recruited Roglič to Bora-Hansgrohe eight years ago, when he signed for Jumbo-Visma.

It was in the Dutch team that the Slovenian became one of the most successful riders in recent years, who has accumulated a total of 80 wins in professional road races.

""I am looking forward to this step, even though a team change is kind of like new territory for me. The good memories of when we met years ago made the talks easy. But the decisive factor was that the team is really motivated to work with me, and that we hold the same ideas,"" Roglič was quoted as saying on the website of his new team.

Roglič's move to a new team has become more or less inevitable after Dane Jonas Vingegaard of Jumbo-Visma won his second consecutive Tour de France in July.

Roglič said as he won the general classification of the Giro d'Italia this year that his main career goal was to win the Tour de France, which would put him in the rare company of seven riders who have won all three of the Grand Tours.

It also became clear that it would be difficult for him to achieve this goal in Jumbo-Visma after this year's race around Spain, where he was chasing his fourth overall victory, only to concede in the end to his US team mate Sepp Kuss.

Denk said that he had gotten the impression from Roglič's statements after the race that he was not satisfied with the outcome and it was them when he approached him. It was a quick agreement, and the last details were sorted out yesterday.

Regarding the recruitment of Roglič eight years ago, he said that the figure of the offer that he had made at the time was more than ten times lower than the current contract.

According to unofficial information from the Global Cycling Network outlet, Roglič has signed a two-year contract.

Denk added that the expectation was that Roglič would elevate the team, labelling him as an exceptional personality and professional who can motivate others.",sport,sport
Slovenia's general government deficit drops to 3.9% in 2022,"In 2022, deficit was generated in all three sub-sectors - the most in the central government (EUR 2.1 billion), followed by local government (EUR 109 million) and social security funds (EUR 104 million).

President stresses importance of N Macedonia's getting closer to EU,"Following an agreement with Bulgaria aimed at lifting its veto on North Macedonia's EU bid, EU membership talks with North Macedonia started in July 2022. Previously, the country had been blocked by Greece over a name dispute, but that was settled when the name was officially changed from Macedonia to North Macedonia in 2019.

Under the deal with Bulgaria, North Macedonia is obliged to include ethnic Bulgarians in its constitution as one of the country's constitutive peoples, but the opposition has stalled the process.

After a meeting with her host and Macedonian counterpart Stevo Pendarovski, Pirc Musar told a joint press conference that on its journey towards EU membership Slovenia had not had it easy either, among other things, the country had to change its constitution.

""But we were able to do it because at the time Slovenian politicians were aware of how important it is to be united on strategic projects involving Slovenia,"" she said, expressing the hope that North Macedonia would also show the political wisdom and implement the constitutional change.

She would like to see new generations of Macedonians live in the EU. ""I would like to see it go faster and for the EU to expand without years-long deadlocks. It is time to move up a gear. In Skopje, in Brussels and in all EU capitals. The road that North Macedonia has travelled so far is important and it is a big one,"" the president said, stressing the importance of changing the constitution before the end of the year.

Postponing difficult decisions would mean that additional generations of Macedonians would have to wait to live in the EU, she said as quoted by her office in a press release, calling on Macedonian political parties to support the proposed constitutional amendment.

Changing the constitution would ""attest to the country's efforts to build a multicultural, multi-ethnic community based on respect for human rights and minority rights"", and advance the country's accession efforts.

Pirc Musar and Pendarovski underlined the long-standing good and friendly relations between Slovenia and North Macedonia.

During her official visit to Skopje, the president also met other top officials, including Prime Minister Dimitar Kovačevski and National Assembly President Talat Xhaferi. With both of them she exchanged assessments on the situation in North Macedonia and the Western Balkans.

She expressed the wish for even closer cooperation in politics, business, culture, education and science.

Addressing the Macedonian National Assembly, Pirc Musar underlined the need for North Macedonia to continue on a European path. She also stressed the importance of the continuation of the Brdo-Brijuni process, as part of which North Macedonia will host a summit in September.

She warned about the issue of young people leaving the region and announced that she would like to address this at the summit through dialogue between heads of state and young people.

The president is scheduled to meet the representatives of the Slovenian ethnic community in North Macedonia today, and the representatives of the Slovenian-Macedonian business community tomorrow morning, before heading to Serbia.

Slovenia is an important economic partner of North Macedonia, including as an investor, with Slovenian companies employing some 3,000 people in the country. Last year, trade between the two countries went up by 14%.",politics,politics

Golden Bee goes to Serbian researcher Slobodan Davidović,"""The Golden Bee Award is certainly one of Slovenia's main tools in raising awareness of the importance of pollinators and promoting specific achievements in their protection. This year's focus on science is in line with its central importance in addressing global challenges,"" said President Nataša Pirc Musar at today's ceremony at the Presidential Palace, calling for more investment in research.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food launched a call for nominations for the Golden Bee award last December. A dozen applications arrived from eight countries: three from Serbia, two each from Ukraine and Germany, and one each from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Spain and Greece, the president's office said.

The award committee shortlisted three candidates. Apart from Davidović, Fani Hatjina from Greece, an internationally renowned researcher at Cardiff University in the UK and long-time director of the Animal Institute of Greece, and Pau Enric Serra Marin, a young Spanish researcher and author of the award-winning documentary on bees Bee or Not to Be, were the finalists.

Davidović is the head of the Serbhiwe project, focussing on innovative strategic research, building on energy research on wild bees and pollinators, and setting milestones for action to fight dropping pollinator numbers by 2030. Together with members of the project, he has analysed genetic diversity of wild bee colonies and developed a roadmap for the analysis of wild populations that live in the wild without human intervention.

The minister said this was a very important research, as it showed how important genetic diversity was in wild pollinators and honey bees. ""Their research has shown that wild bees are more genetically diverse and more heterogeneous than native honey bees,"" Šinko stressed. She said this project would be the basis for Serbia's national strategy on habitat conservation and restoring wild pollinators in the wild.

Davidović said he was glad that the committee recognised their research as a study that has potential. ""I hope that this award will make the research more visible to researchers around the world and change the way we look at wild honey bees and the management of bees and other pollinators,"" he said.

The Golden Bee is the highest national award for the promotion, conservation and research of bees and other pollinators. It was introduced by a special law adopted in March 2021.

Delo says communication in spying scandal was faulty,"The fact that the public was notified of the high-profile arrest in the first place is both a political and expert decision. Since SOVA briefed the top state officials as MPs from the Commission for Oversight of Intelligence and Security Services in detail on the arrest ""what we're seeing is a faulty communication of the government top officials with the citizens"".

There are many more unanswered questions than there are satisfactory answers. In such an environment, which the government co-creates with unclear communication, the opposition has free hands to create stories such as the one that the government wants to divert attention from domestic problems with the presentation of the arrest.

The arrest of the spies was presented to the public by state secretary for national security at the PM's office Andrej Benedejčič instead of the prime minister, who should have presented the arrest himself and praised the Slovenian intelligence agency, the paper says.

Benedejčič, a candidate for ambassador to NATO who is faced with criticism of being pro-Russian, sent a political message on the government's behalf that after the arrest Slovenia is even more credible and trustworthy NATO and EU member.

The paper is also puzzled why Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, who has the most sympathy to Russia's interests, has not yet called the Russian ambassador for talks on the two Russian agents who acted contrary to Slovenia's interests.

""Bottom line is that top Slovenian politicians pursued too many particular interests in this spying scandal, which reflect the different attitudes to Russia and the war in Ukraine for a national story to be made of it despite SOVA having set the ground for this in cooperation with allied agencies,"" Delo says in the commentary The Government Doesn't Know What to Do with SOVA's Success.",politics,politics
NSi will not sign SDS motion against government,"The NSi will stay away from ouster motions in the future, said Tonin, noting that the party has reconsidered their policy after failing to collect the signatures for the interpellation of Culture Minister Asta Vrečko in January.

The party will not support the SDS-sponsored motion, since it does not propose any conclusions, which Tonin finds ""telling"". The NSi will participate in the interpellation to discuss and ""warn about the missteps of the coalition"".

Even though Tonin is critical of the government, saying that it failed to do what it promised and that many announced reforms will not be passed, the NSi is still willing to work with the government in preparing the healthcare reform.

People expect that a responsible opposition would provide alternative solutions, said Tonin, adding that the NSi will hold a programme conference on Saturday to present its ideas for healthcare reform. They are coordinating constitutional changes and will prepare solutions to improve the business environment. The NSi called on the rest of the opposition to do the same.

When everyone chooses politics ""for"", rather than ""against"", the centre-right will begin to win again, said Tonin. The NSi has prepared recommendations for the government and National Assembly to strengthen the values of Slovenian independence, thus forcing MPs to take a stance on specific policies, said Tonin.

The SDS responded by saying its motion came in response to a call by Lojze Peterle, the founder of the precursor to the NSi and the head of the Association of Values of Slovenian Independence (VSO). ""The call was addressed to all political parties, including the NSi.""

One of the main reasons for the motion against the government is the merger of the Museum of Slovenian Independence, which was incepted under the coalition government that included the SDS and NSi, with the Museum of Contemporary History.

The VSO has hailed interpellation of the government as well as the NSi's recommendations to conduct a broader argument-based debate on the significance of independence as a core value of all Slovenians.

""After the government has rejected any dialogue, we see interpellation as an opportunity to reconsider the abolishment of the Museum of Slovenian Independence and a call to understanding Slovenian independence and statehood in order to enhance the national, patriotic and democratic identity,"" the VSO said.

Another issue of contention between the SDS and the NSi is the distribution of seats on the parliamentary commissions for the oversight of public finances and intelligence services. The SDS has still not appointed its members to the two opposition-controlled commissions.

This is the reason why the NSi would not contribute signatures that the SDS needs to open a parliamentary inquiry into GEN-I, the energy company that Robert Golob run before becoming prime minister. The two parliamentary commissions have oversight of all state-owned companies.

""Let's first establish parliamentary oversight of the whole field and we can then go for individual inquiries,"" Tonin said. The NSi has collected signatures for the GEN-I inquiry, but it ""depends fully on the SDS"" when the inquiry commission will be established.",politics,politics
"Capital of Culture project progressing well, EU report says","In the post-monitoring report, the Commission praised the GO! 2025 project for making a clear division of tasks and workflow and simplifying the management of the cross-border capital of culture.

The Commission appreciates the commitment to signing project contracts with both public institutions and non-governmental organisations, the report adds.

Also positively assessed is the progress in establishing international connections by means of closer cooperation with European cultural centres and networks, as well as the willingness of the Nova Gorica team to learn from past ECC projects.

Neda Rusjan Bric, the artistic consultant for the project, said at a press conference in Nova Gorica that the European Commission had also made six recommendations that would be taken into account.

Mayor Samo Turel said that the city would be well prepared for the final evaluation in November 2024, adding that he was satisfied with how the project progressed.

Gorazd Božič, the head of the special-purpose public institution that runs the project, commented on the positive report by saying that the ""decisive year of intensive preparations for 2025 is ahead of us""

Fuel prices going up slightly,"Regulated fuel prices apply only to petrol stations outside the motorway network. Along motorways, retailers are free to set their prices.

Under the current government regulation, the margins for retailers at service stations off motorways are capped at 9.83 cents per litre for diesel, 9.94 cents for regular petrol and 8 cents for heating oil.

The ministry estimates diesel would cost EUR 1.591 and regular EUR 1.339 a litre if prices were not regulated and consumers were not exempt from paying environmental duties.

When filling up a 50-litre tank drivers will thus save EUR 5.4 in case of diesel and EUR 4.85 in case of regular petrol. The saving per 1,000 litres of heating oil is EUR 154.",labour,"economy, business and finance"

Contributions for religious workers cut to 60% despite legal grievances,"A representative of the legal service said the bill was not in line with the constitution, and violated the principles of trust in law and of division of power.

Gabriel Kavčič of the Slovenian Bishops Conference and Haris Muratagić of the Islamic Community in Slovenia regretted there had been no dialogue with religious communities on this matter. Kavčič said the proposed changes came as a negative surprise to them.

At the start of the committee session, New Slovenia (NSi), a junior opposition party, proposed taking this item off the agenda, but the coalition majority rejected the amendment, which promoted the fellow opposition party, the Democrats (SDS), to walk out.

NSi MP Jožef Horvat said the bill should not be discussed because the government had filed it to be fast tracked ""as if this was a matter of lesser importance"".

He too was critical of the lack of dialogue with religious communities even if the changes affect the rights they had acquired in the past.

What is more, there was only a ten-day public consultation period, and the parliament's legal service criticised the bill as ""legally problematic"", he argued.

Rejecting the criticism, Culture Ministry State Secretary Marko Rusjan said the government merely remedied the unlawful situation created by the previous government.

He highlighted a regulation the Janez Janša government adopted in May 2022 to increase the state's coverage of contributions for religious workers to 100%, which he said was not in line with the law. Hence, the government is annulling the unlawful regulation with a bill, he said.

Rusjan also recalled that before austerity legislation was passed in 2012 amid the financial crisis, religious workers had 60% of their social contributions paid by the state. The 2012 austerity law cut them to 48%, which according to Rusjan means that the current cut from 100% to 60% does not affect the acquired rights of churches.

The bill will now be put to the plenary to be passed.",religion and belief,religion and belief
Study shows teenagers able to access alcohol easily online,"The Consumers' Association conducted in July a test showing that not one of ten selected retailers or alcohol delivery providers - asked to deliver via payment upon delivery - requested a document to verify the age of what was 19-year-old recipient at the moment of delivery.

The law prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to individuals under 18 and stipulates that a provider can request proof of age from anyone suspected of being underage.

Nina Križnik of the Consumers' Association told the press on Wednesday that the finding ""indicates a concerning lack of consistency in enforcing the legal requirement for age verification, which is crucial for protecting the health of our children and teenagers"".

Manca Kozlovič from the youth network No excuse Slovenia also finds it worrying that the rate of detected violations in various forms of sale did not decrease in the past year. Alcoholic beverages were sold to more than one in two minors, she said.

Meanwhile, Maja Roškar of the National Institute of Public Health warned that when it comes to youth alcohol consumption, it is necessary to start with the adults. It is their attitude - and this applies not only to parents or guardians but to society as a whole - that affects the rate of consumption among teenagers.

Roškar also highlighted the results of the international study of Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children, which has been conducted in Slovenia every four years since 2002.

It shows that 15% of 11-year-olds, 40% of 13-year-olds, 71% of 15-year-olds, and 86% of 17-year-olds have consumed alcoholic beverages at some point in their lives. One in four 15-year-olds and every second 17-year-old has been drunk at least twice in their life. While youth alcohol consumption in Slovenia is decreasing, it still exceeds the international average, according to Roškar.

She moreover stressed that Slovenia has high alcohol consumption in general, with the majority of the population drinking alcohol, and that accessibility of alcohol is very high. Referring to findings by the World Health Organisation, Roškar said limiting access is one of the most effective measures in efforts to curb consumption.",health,health

Večer: Slovenia needs a New Deal on post-flood reconstruction,"It is now more than clear that the damage from the early August devastating floods will go into billions of euros.

Golob launched procedures to obtain EU solidarity aid on time, but several administrative hurdles will have to be overcome before the money starts flowing from Brussels.

The country has a high debt and a big budget deficit, which means that crisis management will need to be further enhanced.

""We will need some kind of a European recovery plan adjusted to Slovenia, a new deal along the lines of Roosevelt's New Deal from the 1940s,"" says the commentary New Deal.

This is also a reason why Golob is looking for reconstruction money from banks and insurance companies.

While banks are in much better financial shape than insurers, ""the prime minister and Slovenia expect banks to put forward proposals in 48 hours, and the tight ultimatum shows that this time the government, part of which is the Left, which is absolutely in favour of taxing bank profits, means business"".

Večer regrets that the Slovenian capital market is not mature enough to issue a state bond for the post-floods reconstruction, saying that ""a special solidarity fund remains the most realistic option"" to finance it.","economy, business and finance","economy, business and finance"
Another wave of storms hits practically entire country,"After the Environment Agency (ARSO) issued a red alert for the entire country on Tuesday afternoon, the storms first reached north of Slovenia and then split into two parts.

One moved towards east around Maribor and Celje and the other towards central Slovenia, Notranjska (south-central) and Dolenjska and Bela Krajina (south-east).

The regions of Dolenjska and Bela Krajina are said to have been hit the worst, with many trees uprooted and roofs being ripped off buildings, while a kindergarten was also damaged, Civil Protection commander Srečko Šestan told POP TV last evening.

Firefighters evacuated 253 people who were camping outdoors in three municipalities - 110, of whom 70 were kids, were evacuated in Kostel, south, where the strong wind ruined their tents; 45 kids were evacuated in Kranjska Gora, north-west, and 98 in Brežice, east.

More than 20,000 households were left without electricity in central Slovenia, and thousands in the broader area of Maribor, north-east.

In the area of Celje, the electricity company Elektro Celje has already managed to repair most of the damage, so only around 1,300 households are without electricity in their area, around 3,000 fewer than last evening.

ARSO said that wind speeds reached as much as 164 km/h at Kredarica on Mt Triglav in the Julian Alps, and 106 km/h in the area of Črnomelj in Bela Krajina, south-east.

Firefighters from 10 professional and 300 volunteer units helped removed a large number of uprooted trees from roads, railways, buildings, vehicles and telecommunication lines, and covered the exposed tops of residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial buildings.

The storms hit the country after a strong storm system wreaked havoc in several parts of Slovenia last Thursday and Friday, causing significant damage to buildings, cars and crops.

The damage done yesterday is yet to be assessed, while some more local thunderstorms with hail, strong winds and downpours are forecast for this afternoon and night.",disaster and accident,disaster and accident
Golob to visit Meloni in November to discuss border checks,"Giving the doorstep statement as he arrived to the EU summit, Golob said that he will travel to Rome on 14 November and meet with Meloni to discuss police checks on internal borders.

Slovenia set up temporary police checks on its borders with Hungary and Croatia on 21 October after it was informed by Italy that it would establish temporary checks on the border with Slovenia.

""What is important is that it looks for now like it will last two months and should end before Christmas holidays,"" said Golob, adding that they hope to keep the borders open after that. The measures of Slovenia and Italy are coordinated, he said.

When asked if Slovenia now has no arguments to oppose the border checks introduced by Austria in 2015, Golob responded that ""these are two completely different stories"".

All of Europe introduced stricter control at the borders and in the countries in the past weeks because of the situation in the Middle East and consequent terrorist attacks in Europe, said Golob. ""This has nothing to do with migration currents that come, go and come again,"" he said.

He believes the measures will only be in effect for a short time if the situation in the Middle East calms down.

Introduced on 21 October, the border checks were originally supposed to end on 30 October. The Interior Ministry will submit this week to the government documents to extend the measure by 20 days, Interior Minister Boštjan Poklukar said today.

The ministry later told the STA that they will likely propose another extension for a total of two months.",politics,politics
